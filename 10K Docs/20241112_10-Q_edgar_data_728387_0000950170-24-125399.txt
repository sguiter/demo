 In addition to historical information, this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Form 10-Q), contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). This statement is included for the express purpose of availing Perspective Therapeutics, Inc. of the protections of the safe harbor provisions of the PSLRA. 
 
 This Form 10-Q, including Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part I, Item 2, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). All statements contained in this Form 10-Q other than statements of historical fact, including, without limitation, statements regarding our future financial condition, results of operations, business strategy and plans and objectives of management for future operations, industry trends and other future events are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology, such as believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, forecast, project, may, could, might, plan, should, will, would or the negative of these terms and other similar expressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying terms. Forward-looking statements in this Form 10-Q include, among other things: 
 
 the timing, progress and results of our preclinical studies and clinical trials of our current and future program candidates, including statements regarding the timing of our planned regulatory communications, submissions and approvals, initiation and completion of studies or trials and related preparatory work and the period during which the results of the trials will become available, and our research and development programs; 

our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for our future program candidates; 

our manufacturing capabilities and strategy, including the scalability and commercial viability of our manufacturing methods and processes;

our expectations regarding the scope of any approved indication for any program candidate; 

our ability to successfully commercialize our program candidates;

our competitive position and expectations regarding developments and projections relating to our competitors or our industry; and

Perspective Therapeutics, Inc. 
 Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Fin ancial Statements 
 
 . Merger On February 3, 2023, the Company completed the merger of Isoray Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, with Viewpoint Molecular Targeting, Inc. (Viewpoint) (such transaction being the Merger). Pursuant to the Merger, the Company issued shares of its common stock, par value per share (Common Stock), representing approximately of its fully diluted outstanding capital stock as of the close of the Merger. Viewpoint is an alpha-particle radiopharmaceutical company in the alpha-emitter market developing oncology therapeutics and complementary imaging agents. For additional information, see Note 14, Merger , in this Form 10-Q. Discontinued Operations On April 12, 2024, the Company completed the sale of its Cesium-131 brachytherapy business and substantially all of the assets of Isoray Medical, Inc. (Isoray), a wholly owned subsidiary of Perspective Therapeutics, to GT Medical Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (GT Medical) (such transaction being the GT Medical Closing). Pursuant to the GT Medical Closing, GT Medical issued to Isoray shares of GT Medical s common stock, par value per share, representing of GT Medical s issued and outstanding capital stock on a fully diluted basis as of the closing. Accordingly, the financial information and operating results of the Cesium-131 brachytherapy business have been presented as discontinued operations in the condensed consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. Unless otherwise noted, discussion within these notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements relates to continuing operations. For additional information, see Note 4, Discontinued Operations , in this Form 10-Q. Reverse Stock Split On June 14, 2024, the Company effected a 1-for-10 reverse stock split (Reverse Split) of the Company s issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock, and the Common Stock began trading on a split-adjusted basis on June 17, 2024. The Reverse Split did not reduce the total number of authorized shares of Common Stock or the Company s preferred stock (Preferred Stock), or change the par values of the Common Stock or Preferred Stock. The Reverse Split affected all stockholders uniformly and did not affect any stockholder s ownership percentage of the shares of Common Stock (except to the extent that the Reverse Split resulted in some of the stockholders receiving cash in lieu of fractional shares). All outstanding options and warrants entitling their holders to purchase shares of Common Stock were adjusted as a result of the Reverse Split, in accordance with the terms of each such security. In addition, the number of shares reserved for future issuance pursuant to the Company s equity incentive plans was also adjusted accordingly. As a result, all historical per share data, number of shares issued and outstanding, and outstanding options and warrants for the periods presented in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been adjusted retroactively in this Form 10-Q, where applicable, to reflect the Reverse Split. Liquidity The Company assesses its liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. The Company has had a history of operating losses and an absence of significant recurring cash inflows from revenue. At September 30,

million and total accumulated deficit of million. The Company has historically financed its operations primarily through selling equity. The Company believes that its million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of September 30, 2024 will enable it to fund its current planned operations into mid-2026, though it may raise additional capital through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements and/or government funding and grants. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to management, and there can be no assurance that the current operating plan will be achieved in the timeframe anticipated by management or at all, and the Company may need to seek additional funds sooner than anticipated. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from potential unknown factors. 
 Significant Accounting Policies The Company s significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements are described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of the 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no changes to the Company s significant accounting policies, and the Company has not adopted any significant accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 .

million. Subject to the terms and conditions of the 2024 ATM Agreement, each ATM Agent is required to use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell the ATM Shares from time to time, based upon the Company s instructions. The Company has provided the ATM Agents with customary indemnification rights, and the ATM Agents will be entitled to a commission of up to of the gross proceeds from each sale of the ATM Shares effectuated through or to the applicable ATM Agent selling the ATM Shares. Sales of the 2024 ATM Shares, if any, under the 2024 ATM Agreement may be made in transactions that are deemed to be at the market offerings as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Company has no obligation to sell any of the 2024 ATM Shares and may at any time suspend offers under the 2024 ATM Agreement or terminate the 2024 ATM Agreement. The Common Stock to be sold under the 2024 ATM Agreement, if any, will be issued and sold pursuant to the Company s automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-279692) (the May 2024 Registration Statement), which became effective upon filing with the SEC on May 24, 2024. On August 13, 2024, the Company filed a prospectus supplement to the May 2024 Registration Statement with the SEC in connection with the offer and sale of the 2024 ATM Shares pursuant to the 2024 ATM Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has not completed any transactions pursuant to the 2024 ATM Agreement. May 2024 Registered Offering On May 24, 2024, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement with BofA Securities, Inc., as representative of the underwriters named therein, in connection with its previously announced underwritten offering (Registered Offering) of shares (Registered Offering Shares) of Common Stock and, in lieu of Registered Offering Shares to certain investors, pre-funded warrants (May 2024 Pre-funded Warrants) to purchase shares of Common Stock. The price to the investors for the Registered Offering Shares was per Registered Offering Share, and the price to the investors for the May 2024 Pre-funded Warrants was per May 2024 Pre-funded Warrant, which represents the per share price for the Registered Offering Shares less the per share exercise price for each such May 2024 Pre-funded Warrant. The Registered Offering closed on May 29, 2024. BofA Securities, Inc., Oppenheimer Co. Inc. and RBC Capital Markets, LLC acted as joint book-running managers for the Registered Offering and B. Riley Securities, Inc. acted as a co-manager for the Registered Offering. JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC acted as a financial advisor for the Registered Offering. The gross proceeds to the Company from the Registered Offering were approximately million, before underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated expenses of the Registered Offering. The Registered Offering was made pursuant to the May 2024 Registration Statement, a related base prospectus, free writing prospectus and prospectus supplement each dated May 24, 2024. The May 2024 Pre-funded Warrants became exercisable subsequent to the filing and effectiveness of an amendment to the Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on June 14, 2024. The exercise price and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each May 2024 Pre-funded Warrant are subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of certain stock dividends and distributions, stock splits, stock combinations, reclassifications or similar events affecting the Common Stock as well as upon any distribution of assets, including cash, stock or other property, to the Company s stockholders. The May 2024 Pre-funded Warrants will not expire and are exercisable in cash or by means of a cashless exercise. A holder of May 2024 Pre-funded Warrants may not exercise such May 2024 Pre-funded Warrants if the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by such holder, together with its affiliates, would be more than or , as elected by such holder, of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock following such exercise, as such percentage ownership is determined in accordance with the terms of the May 2024 Pre-funded Warrants. A holder of May 2024 Pre-funded Warrants may increase or decrease this percentage not in excess of by providing at least 61 days prior notice to the Company.

ITEM 2 MANA GEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together (i) with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 (Form 10-Q), (ii) with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on March 28, 2024 (2023 Form 10-K) and (iii) with other filings we have made with the SEC. As discussed under the heading Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs, and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those described under the heading Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K that may cause actual results to differ materially from those described in or implied by any forward-looking statements. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in these notes to the Company, Perspective, we, us and our except where the context requires otherwise, refer to Perspective Therapeutics, Inc. and its subsidiaries. References to Viewpoint refer to Viewpoint Molecular Targeting, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary, and references to Isoray refer to Isoray Medical, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary. 
 Overview 
 We are developing the next generation of precision-targeted alpha therapies (TAT) for oncology that have the potential to treat a large population of cancer patients across multiple tumor types, including those with metastatic disease. By leveraging our proprietary TAT platform, we aim to develop alpha-emitting radiopharmaceuticals that can be attached to targeting peptides to deliver the radioactive payload directly to difficult-to-treat tumors. The foundation of our TAT platform is our Pb-specific chelator (PSC) and peptide linker technology, which is designed to enable us to connect our alpha-emitting isotope of choice, Lead-212 212 Pb or Pb-212), to a desired targeting peptide to deliver radiation directly to cancer cells. Unlike commercially available chelators and linkers, our proprietary PSC and peptide linker have shown, in preclinical studies, the differentiated ability to promote enhanced clearance of the non-tumor localized 212 Pb payload without sacrificing the uptake of the alpha particle into the tumor. Rapid clearance of the alpha-emitting isotope from normal tissues is important to enhance tolerability and widen the therapeutic window of our program candidates. We are also developing complementary diagnostics that utilize the same targeting peptide and imaging isotopes such as Lead-203 203 Pb or Pb-203), Gallium-68 68 Ga or Ga-68) or Copper-64 64 Cu or Cu-64) to provide the opportunity to understand which patients may respond to targeted therapy. 
 Our platform generates TATs that are comprised of three components: (i) a targeting peptide that is designed to selectively target ligands that are unique to, or preferentially expressed on, cancer cells throughout the body; (ii) the alpha-emitting medical isotope 212 Pb designed to kill cancer cells; and (iii) our proprietary linker that attaches the targeting molecule to the radioactive payload. 
 We utilized our TAT platform to discover, design and develop our initial programs, VMT- -NET and VMT01, which are currently in ongoing Phase 1/2a clinical trials, and we plan to continue to leverage our platform to assess the potential of and develop multiple additional pipeline programs. Using our proprietary platform technology, VMT- -NET and VMT01 are engineered to target cancer-specific receptors on tumor cells. 
 VMT- -NET 
 [ 212 Pb]VMT- -NET is a TAT in development for patients with unresectable or metastatic somatostatin receptor type 2 (SSTR2)-expressing tumors who have not previously received peptide-targeted radiopharmaceutical therapy, such as Lutathera. We have initiated dosing in Cohorts 1 and 2 of our Phase 1/2a study of [ 212 Pb]VMT- -NET in patients with unresectable or metastatic SSTR2-expressing neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). In April 2024, we announced that this program was selected by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to participate in the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) Development and Readiness Pilot (CDRP) Program. The FDA s CDRP Program was initiated in 2022 to facilitate alignment of CMC development of novel products under investigational new drug (IND) applications with expedited clinical development timeframes based upon the anticipated clinical benefits of earlier patient access. The observation period was completed for dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in seven patients enrolled in Cohort 2 during the second quarter of 2024. Subsequently, the safety monitoring committee (SMC) determined that the safety data observations during the DLT period supported proceeding with dose escalation to Cohort 3. A protocol amendment to expand the number of patients dosed at 5 mCi (up to 40 patients) has been submitted to sites and patient enrollment is open. During the third quarter, data informing the SMC s recommendations were submitted to and accepted for presentation at the 2024 North American Tumor Society (NANETS) Multidisciplinary NET Medical Symposium taking place November 21-23, 2024 in Chicago. We plan to host a conference call at the start of the conference and will provide details prior to the call. Based on FDA interactions prior to the initiation of patient dosing in this study, the decision to open a Cohort 3 will follow after consultation and alignment with the agency. 
 
 On June 10, 2024, we announced multiple updates featuring our alpha-particle radiopharmaceuticals at the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (SNMMI) 2024 Annual Meeting. The data presentations highlighted favorable safety profiles and potential benefits of our lead clinical candidates. Specifically, we reported on a Phase 0 imaging trial that is evaluating the optimal imaging timepoint(s) for diagnostic/dosimetric performance of [ 203 Pb]VMT- -NET in neuroendocrine tumors. Investigators analyzed 48 lesions across nine patients, and the results showed that tumor uptake of [ 203 Pb]VMT- -NET peaked at approximately four hours post-injection, 
 18 

Table of Contents 

with 98 of maximum uptake observed at one hour. The results suggest that imaging with [ 203 Pb]VMT- -NET at four hours post-injection has the best overall diagnostic performance, followed closely by imaging at one hour. 
 
 Also at SNMMI, an investigator reported on [ 212 Pb]VMT- -NET planning based on [ 203 Pb]VMT- -NET predictive dosimetry in an investigator-sponsored trial. The investigators applied patient-specific dosimetry in a Phase 0 imaging trial (NCT05111509) of [ 203 Pb]VMT-a-NET and in the first cohort of a Phase 1 absorbed-dose escalation study (NCT06148636) of [ 212 Pb]VMT- -NET. Ten patients with -peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT)-relapsed or refractory gastroenteropancreatic (GEP)-NETs received [ 203 Pb]VMT- -NET (5 mCi) followed by sequential blood sampling, planar imaging and qSPECT/CT imaging at 1 hour, 4 hours, 24 hours and 48 hours post-administration. Three of ten patients received amino acid infusions while seven patients did not receive amino acids. 
 
 The dosimetry showed that the average renal doses for patients who received amino acids was 0.46 0.20 Gy/mCi, as compared to 0.56 0.16 Gy/mCi for patients who did not receive amino acids; the difference was not statistically significant. For the three patients who received [ 212 Pb]VMT- -NET treatment, based upon their individual dosimetry results, they were prescribed 5.3, 7.3, and 13.3 mCi cumulative activity (delivered over two cycles), respectively, to reach the cohort target renal dose of 3.5 Gy. Higher levels of targeted renal-absorbed doses are in the protocol for subsequent cohorts. 
 
 Additionally at SNMMI, the lead investigator reported on an exploratory first-in-human use of [ 212 Pb]VMT- -NET in adult patients with histologically confirmed metastatic NETs and medullary thyroid carcinomas in an investigator-led research study in India. The investigator reported updated safety and anti-tumor activity of [ 212 Pb]VMT- -NET administered at 67 Ci/kg (2.5 MBq/kg) every eight weeks in 13 patients as of the data cut-off date of May 31, 2024. All patients received prior treatments, eight of whom received prior PRRT treatment. Six patients remained eligible for further treatments as of the data cut-off date. 
 
 The investigator concluded that the toxicity profile suggests the potential for dose escalation to achieve optimal treatment responses. Confirmed tumor response per RECIST 1.1 was reported to be observed in eight of the 13 patients, while unconfirmed responses were observed in two additional patients who eventually had progressive disease and died. Median progression free survival was reported to be 16.4 months (95 confidence interval: 3.5 to NA). The investigator also reported higher absorbed doses in the tumors compared to select other tissues. 
 Subsequently, in October 2024, at the 37th Annual Congress of the European Association of Nuclear Medicine in Hamburg, Germany, the investigator presented an update on a subset of the previously reported investigator-led research study in India. The cut-off date was September 15, 2024, and the study focused on 10 patients with well-differentiated GEP-NETs. These patients were treated with [ 212 Pb]VMT- -NET at a dosage of 67 Ci/kg (2.5 MBq/kg), with an interval of eight weeks for up to six cycles. Treatment was well tolerated with a modest and manageable adverse effect profile. Confirmed tumor response per RECIST 1.1 was observed in six of the 10 GEP-NETs patients. The investigator again concluded that the toxicity profile suggests the potential for dose escalation to achieve optimal treatment responses. Long-term survival data will mature with continued follow up. 
 Additionally, dosimetry estimates were collected from five of the 10 GEP-NETs patients discussed above. The results demonstrated that SPECT/CT imaging with [ 212 Pb]VMT- -NET showed prompt tumor accumulation, high tumor retention and rapid renal excretion in all patients. Overall, the findings suggest that post-treatment imaging of [ 212 Pb]VMT- -NET is feasible and can potentially serve as a valuable tool to evaluate and monitor patients through a full course of treatment. 
 VMT01 
 [ 212 Pb]VMT01 is a TAT in development for second-line or later treatment of patients with progressive MC1R-positive metastatic melanoma. MC1R, or melanocortin 1 receptor, is a protein that can be overexpressed in metastatic melanoma. VMT01 can be radiolabeled with either 203 Pb for patient selection and dosimetry assessments, or 212 Pb for alpha-particle therapy. In preclinical experiments [ 212 Pb]VMT01 demonstrated efficacy via two distinct mechanisms of action: direct cell killing at high radiation doses and through immunostimulatory low-dose induction of immune-mediated cell death. Efficacy was augmented by immune checkpoint inhibitors. In September 2024, we announced that on the basis of these results, the FDA granted Fast Track Designation for the clinical development of [ 212 Pb]VMT01. This study is a multi-center, open-label dose escalation, dose expansion study (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT05655312) in patients with histologically confirmed melanoma and MC1R-positive imaging scans. Patients were required to have already received standard of care. Eligible patients may receive up to three treatments with [ 212 Pb]VMT01, eight weeks apart. 
 In March 2024, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb to evaluate the safety and tolerability of [ 212 Pb]VMT01 in combination with Bristol Myers Squibb s checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab in patients with histologically confirmed melanoma and positive MC1R imaging scans. A protocol amendment was submitted in July 2024 to explore the combination of nivolumab with [ 212 Pb]VMT01 in patients with histologically confirmed melanoma and positive MC1R imaging scans in our ongoing Phase 1/2a clinical study of [ 212 Pb]VMT01.

In October 2024, we announced initial results from the first two dosing cohorts in our Phase 1/2a clinical study of [ 212 Pb]VMT01. Three patients were enrolled in Cohort 1 (who received 3 mCi of [ 212 Pb]VMT01), while seven patients were enrolled in Cohort 2 (who received 5 mCi of [ 212 Pb]VMT01). Patients in each cohort received a median of five prior lines of systematic therapy, including a median of three prior lines of immunotherapy. 
 Safety findings: No dose-limiting toxicities were observed among any patients, and no adverse events led to treatment discontinuation. Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were mostly Grades 1 and 2. None of the four cases of grade 3 TEAEs were deemed to be treatment related. There were no grade 4 or 5 TEAEs. No renal toxicities had been reported as of October 11, 2024 (there were no clinically significant changes in blood urea nitrogen or serum creatinine) in spite of dosimetry estimated renal radiation that approached the higher end of conventional dosing. 

Efficacy findings: All patients in Cohort 1 completed three treatments, with one patient experiencing an unconfirmed RECIST version 1.1 objective response after completion of treatment, and two patients experiencing stable disease at nine and 11 months from the start of treatment, respectively. In Cohort 2, patients progressed after either the first cycle (three patients) or the second cycle (four patients). These findings are consistent with published and ongoing preclinical studies showing immunostimulatory effects at lower radiation doses. 

The SMC reviewed these findings and recommended exploring a lower dose level of 1.5 mCi per dose, both as a single agent and in combination with nivolumab. The SMC recommendation would allow for the monotherapy and combination cohorts to proceed concurrently. An amendment to further explore lower dose levels for monotherapy is planned. The combination cohort at 1.5 mCi per dose with nivolumab is active and now open for enrollment. 
 PSV359 
 In March 2024, we disclosed a novel pre-IND stage asset (PSV359) that targets fibroblast activation protein- , which is associated with a variety of solid tumors. We are currently working on an IND for PSV359 which we expect to file in late 2024. If the study may proceed, we expect that the U.S. Phase 1 study would commence in 2025. 
 On June 10, 2024, at the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging 2024 Annual Meeting, researchers presented a novel fibroblast activation protein (FAP), which is a protein abundantly expressed in certain cancer cells as well as cancer-associated fibroblasts in tumor lesions and involved in promoting disease progression. The peptide was conjugated to a Pb-specific chelator via a molecular linker to form a novel construct, PSV359. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo performance of [ 203/212 Pb]PSV359 in preclinical xenograft models. Overall, strong anti-tumor clinical activity of [ 212 Pb]PSV359 was found in both FAP on cancer cells and FAP in stromal tissues xenograft models. 
 During an update at the World Molecular Imaging Congress on September 10, 2024, we announced that data substantiated favorable safety and strong efficacy profiles in preclinical studies of our novel human FAP-targeting candidate, PSV359. During preclinical evaluation of [ 203/212 Pb]PSV359 for imaging and alpha-particle therapy of cancers expressing FAP, the researcher found that in vitro, [ 203/212 Pb]PSV359 demonstrated superior FAP-binding affinity and specificity, and that [ 203 Pb]PSV359 showed strong tumor uptake and clearance from the blood via the renal system. In the study, [ 212 Pb]PSV359 also showed strong anti-tumor effects in xenograft models in which FAP was either on cancer cells or in stromal tissues. 
 Other 
 Data presented at the World Molecular Imaging Congress in September 2024 also demonstrated the need for customized chelators to maximize stability and targeted delivery of potent alpha-particles. With the support of computational modeling, investigators used multiple chelators that are commonly used in radionuclide therapy, along with alpha emitters, beta emitters and imaging tracers, to determine compatibility between chelators and radionuclides. The study confirmed that modified chelators demonstrated superior performance when compared to conventional chelators. 
 
 Pre-targeting technology is designed to enable the use of antibodies to direct radiolabeled ligands to tumor sites. Antibodies can bind with high specificity to a wider variety of cancer-specific proteins preferentially expressed on the surface of tumor cells. However, the amount of time required for an adequate amount of antibodies to bind to the cancer-specific proteins may not align with the properties of the desired isotope. By attaching an additional chemical entity to an antibody that would bind to a radioligand, the resultant modified antibodies may be administered separately from and in advance of the radioligand as appropriate. Preclinical optimization of this platform is underway, and initial targeting antibodies have been identified for further investigation. 
 In January 2024, we announced that we have a license agreement with Mayo Clinic for the rights to Mayo's prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) Alpha-PET DoubLET platform technology for the treatment of PSMA-expressing cancers, with an initial focus on prostate. This radiopharmaceutical platform provides detailed PET imaging-based diagnosis and dosimetry using long-lived Cu-64 for imaging and alpha-particle targeted therapies using 212 Pb. Preclinical studies are ongoing to assess whether this new molecular entity meets the hurdle for progressing into the clinic with potential to achieve best-in-class profile.

Also in January 2024, we entered into an exclusive in-licensing of Stony Brook University s Cuburbit[7]uril-admantane (CB7-Adma) pre-targeting platform which covers the global intellectual property rights to such platform. Pre-targeting using the CB7-Adma platform involves two steps. First, an antibody that binds with high specificity to a cancer-specific protein is administered via intravenous injection. This antibody is chemically modified to include the CB7 chemical entity and accumulates over time at the tumor site. Then, a radionuclide held tightly by our proprietary chelator attached to an Adma group is administered. The Adma group binds to the CB7 group that was previously attached to the cancerous cells with remarkable specificity, delivering radiation dose selectively to the tumor sites. Central to this innovation is CB7-Adma (host-guest) complex formation, driving the interaction between the antibody and radioligand. The chosen host-guest pair, CB7-Adma, demonstrates promising in vivo stability, modularity and low immunogenicity. The platform s potential was validated through in vivo profiling of ligands, employing a CB7-modified CEA targeting antibody. The agreement with Stony Brook University will expire on the later of the expiration date of the last to expire licensed patents or 20 years from the date of the first sale of a product utilizing the intellectual property. 
 
 Intellectual Property (IP) 
 
 Two patents have recently been granted on key assets for which we have exclusive licenses from the University of Iowa. US 12,128,115, granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office on October 29, 2024, is directed to the use of compounds comprising PSC for performing chelating reaction with divalent metals, including Pb 2+ , and the use of such compounds for diagnosing and treating diseases. AU 2017281940, granted by IP Australia on October 31, 2024, is directed to melanoma-targeting radiopharmaceutical compounds and the use of such compounds for treating melanoma. Both patents further strengthen our IP portfolio. 
 Funding Requirements 
 We have had recurring losses since inception. We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance and expand preclinical activities, clinical trials and potential commercialization of our program candidates. Our costs will also increase as we: 
 continue the development of our clinical-stage metastatic melanoma tumor and neuroendocrine tumor assets, including VMT01 and VMT- -NET; 

continue the development of our other program candidates; 

continue to initiate and progress other supporting studies required for regulatory approval of our program candidates; 

initiate preclinical studies and clinical trials for any additional indications for our current program candidates and any future program candidates that we may pursue; 

continue to build our portfolio of program candidates through the acquisition or in-license of additional program candidates or technologies; 

continue to develop, maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; 

pursue regulatory approvals for our current and future program candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; 

continue to build our manufacturing capabilities; 

support our marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any future program candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval; and 

hire additional clinical, medical, development and other personnel. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of 267.8 million. We believe our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund our current planned operations for at least the next 12 months from the date the consolidated financial statements in this report were issued and into mid-2026. Monthly operating expenses are budgeted to increase for research and development and general and administrative expenses as management works to implement its strategy to advance our clinical assets in their clinical trials and to progress our preclinical assets towards clinical trials. Management anticipates a significant increase in expenses, particularly in research and development, as we undertake these activities. 
 Manufacturing Equipment 
 On September 18, 2024, we entered into a Master Equipment and Services Agreement (MESA) and statements of work (SOWs) thereunder with Comecer SpA (Comecer), pursuant to which we agreed to purchase from Comecer manufacturing equipment for the production of our radiopharmaceutical products including, but not limited to, isotope processing hot cells and production suites and related equipment (collectively, the Deliverables) and services for installation and validation of the Deliverables at several of our production facilities in the United States. The aggregate consideration for such equipment and services pursuant to the MESA and SOWs is approximately 49.0 million payable in cash, excluding certain incidental costs such as taxes, customs and duties, local transport, insurance and rigging. We may also elect to purchase certain additional equipment and services pursuant to the SOWs. The MESA provides for the payment of certain amounts in installments over the course of the production, installation and validation of the Deliverables.

Facility Acquisitions 
 On July 15, 2024, August 2, 2024 and October 31, 2024, we purchased a building located in the Houston, Texas, metropolitan area for 4.7 million, a building in the Chicago, Illinois, metropolitan area for 5.0 million, and a building in the Los Angeles, California, metropolitan area for 11.0 million, respectively, which we intend to use for the manufacture of our program candidates upon completion of modifications and installation of equipment. 
 In March 2024, we acquired the assets and associated lease of Lantheus radiopharmaceutical manufacturing facility in Somerset, New Jersey. We believe we will be able to convert the facility, which has three production suites, to manufacture finished radiopharmaceutical product. As a Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) compliant facility, we intend to utilize the facility to manufacture clinical supply of high quality 203 Pb-labeled tumor-specific peptides to visualize and diagnose tumors, and 212 Pb-labeled radiopharmaceuticals to treat target tumors with TAT. As of October 2024, this facility is operational to supply investigational products to support VMT- -NET clinical studies, in addition to the Coralville, Iowa facility which has been producing our investigational products since 2023. Moreover, with three CGMP suites at the facility, we expect to have the capacity to meet future clinical trial and commercial demands at major cancer treatment centers throughout the Northeastern U.S. We intend to continue to expand our manufacturing and supply network in the future as we anticipate increasing our clinical trial activities. 
 We continue to evaluate the suitability of additional facilities as we look to expand our research and development capabilities. 
 2024 At-the-Market (ATM) Agreement 
 On August 13, 2024, we entered into a Controlled Equity Offering SM Sales Agreement (2024 ATM Agreement) with Cantor Fitzgerald Co. and RBC Capital Markets, LLC (each, an ATM Agent, and together, the ATM Agents) pursuant to which we, from time to time, may offer and sell shares (2024 ATM Shares) of our Common Stock, through or to the ATM Agents having an aggregate sales price of up to 250.0 million. 
 Subject to the terms and conditions of the 2024 ATM Agreement, each ATM Agent is required to use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell the ATM Shares from time to time, based upon our instructions. We have provided the ATM Agents with customary indemnification rights, and the ATM Agents will be entitled to a commission of up to 3.0 of the gross proceeds from each sale of the ATM Shares effectuated through or to the applicable ATM Agent selling the ATM Shares. 
 
 Sales of the 2024 ATM Shares, if any, under the 2024 ATM Agreement may be made in transactions that are deemed to be at the market offerings as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We have no obligation to sell any of the 2024 ATM Shares and may at any time suspend offers under the 2024 ATM Agreement or terminate the 2024 ATM Agreement. 
 
 The Common Stock to be sold under the 2024 ATM Agreement, if any, will be issued and sold pursuant to our automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-279692) (the May 2024 Registration Statement), which became effective upon filing with the SEC on May 24, 2024. On August 13, 2024, we filed a prospectus supplement to the May 2024 Registration Statement with the SEC in connection with the offer and sale of the 2024 ATM Shares pursuant to the 2024 ATM Agreement. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have not completed any transactions pursuant to the 2024 ATM Agreement. 
 Amended and Restated Equity Incentive Plan 
 On May 31, 2024, we held our 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (Annual Meeting). At the Annual Meeting, our stockholders approved our Third Amended and Restated 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (the Amended and Restated Plan) which, among other things, (a) increased the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock authorized for issuance under the Amended and Restated Plan by 4,870,092 for a total of 12,500,000 shares of Common Stock, and (b) adjusted the evergreen provision included therein, such that the number of shares of Common Stock available for the grant of awards under the Amended and Restated Plan will automatically increase on January 1 of each year in an amount equal to 5 of the number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding on December 31 of the immediately preceding year (subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits and other similar events); provided, however, that our Board of Directors may act prior to January 1 of a given year to provide that there will be no increase in the share limit for such year or provide that the increase for such year will be a lesser number of shares of Common Stock. On August 14, 2024, we filed a Form S-8 to register 4,870,092 additional shares of Common Stock authorized for issuance under the Amended and Restated Plan as approved by stockholders at the Annual Meeting. 
 Brachytherapy Divestiture 
 On April 12, 2024 (GT Medical Closing Date), we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets (GT Medical Closing) of Isoray to GT Medical Technologies, Inc. (GT Medical). As previously disclosed, on December 7, 2023, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the GT Medical APA) with Isoray and GT Medical. Pursuant to the GT Medical APA, Isoray sold to GT Medical, and GT Medical purchased from Isoray, all of Isoray s right, title and interest in and to substantially all of the assets of Isoray related to Isoray s

Table of Contents 

commercial Cesium-131 business including equipment, certain contracts and leases, inventory and intellectual property. Subject to limited exceptions set forth in the GT Medical APA, GT Medical did not assume the liabilities of Isoray. 
 
 Pursuant to the terms of, and subject to the conditions specified in, the GT Medical APA, at the GT Medical Closing, (i) GT Medical issued to Isoray 279,516 shares of GT Medical s common stock, par value 0.0001 per share, representing 0.5 of GT Medical s issued and outstanding capital stock on a fully diluted basis (excluding Series C-1 warrants which, if exercised, will reduce Isoray s ownership to 0.44 of GT Medical s issued and outstanding capital stock on a fully diluted basis) as of the GT Medical Closing Date and (ii) Isoray has the right to receive, and GT Medical is obligated to pay, certain cash royalty payments during each of the first four years beginning upon the GT Medical Closing Date (each such year, a Measurement Period), as summarized below: 
 with respect to GT Medical s net sales of Cesium-131 brachytherapy seeds for cases that do not utilize GT Medical s GammaTile Therapy: (a) if such net sales for a Measurement Period are 10.0 million or less, 3.0 of such net sales; (b) if such net sales for a Measurement Period are greater than 10.0 million and less than 15.0 million, 4.0 of such net sales; and (c) if such net sales for a Measurement Period are 15.0 million or more, 5.0 of such net sales; and 

with respect to GT Medical s net sales of GT Medical s GammaTile Therapy utilizing Cesium-131 brachytherapy seeds: 0.5 of such net sales for a Measurement Period. 

As a result of the transaction, we have effectively exited the brachytherapy segment and are focused exclusively on our radiopharmaceutical development segment, our only operating segment and reporting segment. The sale of the brachytherapy segment represents a strategic shift that had a major effect on our operations. We accounted for the transaction as discontinued operations on the date the divestiture was announced. Accordingly, we are reporting the results of the brachytherapy segment operations and cash flows, and balance sheet classifications for the current and comparative periods as discontinued operations. Prior to the consummation of the sale, we were neither actively marketing the brachytherapy business for sale nor had intentions to abandon it. 
 
 For additional information regarding our brachytherapy divestiture, see our Forms 8-K filed with the SEC on December 12, 2023, April 3, 2024 and April 16, 2024. 
 
 Viewpoint Merger 
 On February 3, 2023, we completed the merger of Isoray Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of ours, with Viewpoint Molecular Targeting, Inc. (Viewpoint) (such transaction being the Merger). Pursuant to the Merger, we issued 13,654,507 shares of Common Stock, representing approximately 49 of our fully diluted outstanding capital stock as of the closing of the Merger. Viewpoint is developing the next generation of precision-targeted alpha therapies (TAT) for oncology that have the potential to treat a large population of cancer patients across multiple tumor types, including those with metastatic disease. 
 
 For additional information regarding the Merger, see our Forms 8-K filed with the SEC on September 28, 2022 and on February 6, 2023, and our Form 8-K/A filed with the SEC on April 21, 2023. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and could, therefore, differ materially from those estimates if actual conditions differ from our assumptions. The accounting policies and related risks described in Part II, Item 7 and Note 2, Accounting Policies , to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of our 2023 Form 10-K are those that depend most heavily on these judgments and estimates. As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to any of the critical accounting policies and estimates contained therein. 
 Results of Operations 
 We previously presented our results in two segments: Drug Operations and Brachytherapy. Due to the sale of our brachytherapy segment to GT Medical in the second quarter of 2024 and the classification of the assets and operations of the brachytherapy segment as discontinued operations in our condensed consolidated financial statements, we have now determined that we operate in only one segment. The following does not include a discussion of the results of our discontinued operations. For additional information regarding our discontinued operations, see Note 4, Discontinued Operations , to the condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.

Grant Revenue 
 Our alpha-therapy business is pre-revenue and, accordingly, none of the revenues reflect sales of any of our alpha-therapy products, which are still under development. Grant revenue for all periods presented relates to our work for the National Institutes of Health. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Research and development 
 
 Research and development expenses were 12.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 6.4 million. Research and development expenses were 28.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 14.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 14.6 million. The increase in research and development expenses was related to the expanded development of our TAT drug programs, including higher personnel costs and third-party research and development fees. 
 
 Management believes that research and development expenses will continue to increase as we continue to invest in the development of novel radiopharmaceutical drugs and products and expand our manufacturing capabilities. 
 General and administrative 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of the costs related to our executive, finance, human resources and information technology functions. 
 
 General and administrative expenses were 7.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 2.5 million. The increase in general and administrative expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to increased personnel costs as well as increased fees for professional services, taxes and insurance. 
 
 General and administrative expenses were 18.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 16.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 2.3 million. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to increased personnel costs as well as increased fees for professional services, taxes and insurance. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. We have historically financed our operations primarily through selling equity to investors. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we entered into various agreements and raised approximately 306.7 million in gross proceeds. The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented (in thousands):

Cash flows from operating activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities of 8.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to amounts received pursuant to that certain option agreement, dated January 8, 2024, of 28.0 million, between us and Lantheus Alpha Therapy, LLC, an increase of 14.9 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses, and an increase of 4.2 million in non-cash charges such as share-based compensation and depreciation expense, partially offset by a net loss of approximately 39.1 million. 
 Net cash used in operating activities of 27.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to a net loss of approximately 21.8 million and approximately 6.4 million in adjustments for non-cash activities, such as share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization expense, loss on property and equipment disposals, and changes in deferred taxes, partially offset by an increase of approximately 0.3 million in changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily from accrued personnel expenses. 
 Cash flows from investing activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities of 80.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to acquisitions of property and equipment and purchases of U.S. Treasury Bills, partially offset by proceeds from the maturity of these previously held short-term investments. 
 Net cash provided by investing activities of 24.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to transactions related to the purchase of fixed assets and proceeds from the maturity of previously held short-term investments in U.S. Treasury Bills and cash acquired as part of the merger with Viewpoint. 
 Cash flows from financing activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities of 289.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily related to the various capital markets transactions and other agreements we entered into, partially offset by repayment of a note payable. For additional information regarding the cash we raised, see Sources of Liquidity below. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities of 0.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily related to cash provided by the exercise of stock options of approximately 0.6 million, partially offset by the costs related to Common Stock issued in exchange for Viewpoint common stock and the repayment of notes payable.

 2024 At-the-Market (ATM) Agreement 
 On August 13, 2024, we entered into a Controlled Equity Offering SM Sales Agreement (2024 ATM Agreement) with Cantor Fitzgerald Co. and RBC Capital Markets, LLC (each, an ATM Agent, and together, the ATM Agents) pursuant to which we, from time to time, may offer and sell shares (2024 ATM Shares) of our Common Stock, through or to the ATM Agents having an aggregate sales price of up to 250.0 million. 
 Subject to the terms and conditions of the 2024 ATM Agreement, each ATM Agent is required to use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell the ATM Shares from time to time, based upon our instructions. We have provided the ATM Agents with customary indemnification rights, and the ATM Agents will be entitled to a commission of up to 3.0 of the gross proceeds from each sale of the ATM Shares effectuated through or to the applicable ATM Agent selling the ATM Shares. 
 
 Sales of the 2024 ATM Shares, if any, under the 2024 ATM Agreement may be made in transactions that are deemed to be at the market offerings as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We have no obligation to sell any of the 2024 ATM Shares and may at any time suspend offers under the 2024 ATM Agreement or terminate the 2024 ATM Agreement. 
 
 The Common Stock to be sold under the 2024 ATM Agreement, if any, will be issued and sold pursuant to our automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-279692) (the May 2024 Registration Statement), which became effective upon filing with the SEC on May 24, 2024. On August 13, 2024, we filed a prospectus supplement to the May 2024 Registration Statement with the SEC in connection with the offer and sale of the 2024 ATM Shares pursuant to the 2024 ATM Agreement. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have not completed any transactions pursuant to the 2024 ATM Agreement.

May 2024 Registered Offering 
 On May 24, 2024, we entered into an underwriting agreement with BofA Securities, Inc., as representative of the underwriters named therein, in connection with its previously announced underwritten offering (Registered Offering) of 5,151,588 shares (Registered Offering Shares) of our Common Stock and, in lieu of Registered Offering Shares to certain investors, pre-funded warrants (May 2024 Pre-funded Warrants) to purchase 146,425 shares of Common Stock. The price to the investors for the Registered Offering Shares was 15.10 per Registered Offering Share, and the price to the investors for the May 2024 Pre-funded Warrants was 15.09 per May 2024 Pre-funded Warrant, which represents the per share price for the Registered Offering Shares less the 0.01 per share exercise price for each such May 2024 Pre-funded Warrant. The Registered Offering closed on May 29, 2024. BofA Securities, Inc., Oppenheimer Co. Inc. and RBC Capital Markets, LLC acted as joint book-running managers for the Registered Offering and B. Riley Securities, Inc. acted as a co-manager for the Registered Offering. JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC acted as a financial advisor for the Registered Offering. 
 Our gross proceeds from the Registered Offering were approximately 80.0 million, before underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated expenses of the Offering. We intend to use the net proceeds from the Registered Offering for: (i) the continued clinical development of VMT- -NET, VMT-01/02 and PSV359; (ii) the continued development of PSV40X and additional preclinical product candidates as well as a broader development platform; and (iii) the build out, operation and expansion of manufacturing facilities, as well as for working capital and other general corporate purposes. A portion of the net proceeds may also be used to acquire, license or invest in complementary products, technologies, intellectual property or businesses, although we have no present commitments or agreements to do so. 
 The May 2024 Pre-funded Warrants became exercisable subsequent to the filing and effectiveness of an amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on June 14, 2024. The exercise price and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each May 2024 Pre-funded Warrant are subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of certain stock dividends and distributions, stock splits, stock combinations, reclassifications or similar events affecting the Common Stock as well as upon any distribution of assets, including cash, stock or other property, to our stockholders. The May 2024 Pre-funded Warrants will not expire and are exercisable in cash or by means of a cashless exercise. A holder of May 2024 Pre-funded Warrants may not exercise such May 2024 Pre-funded Warrants if the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by such holder, together with its affiliates, would be more than 4.99 or 9.99 , as elected by such holder, of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock following such exercise, as such percentage ownership is determined in accordance with the terms of the May 2024 Pre-funded Warrants. A holder of May 2024 Pre-funded Warrants may increase or decrease this percentage not in excess of 19.99 by providing at least 61 days prior notice to us. 
 
 On April 11, 2024, we sold shares of our Common Stock pursuant to that certain At Market Issuance Sales Agreement (ATM Agreement), dated as of November 17, 2023, by and among us, Oppenheimer Co. Inc., B. Riley Securities, Inc. and JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC. The sales resulted in gross proceeds to us of approximately 49.5 million. For additional information regarding the ATM Agreement, see our Form S-3 filed on November 17, 2023 and Form S-3/A filed on December 7, 2023. 
 
 March 2024 Private Placement with Institutional Investors 
 
 On March 4, 2024, we entered into an investment agreement with certain accredited institutional investors pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell, in a private placement (March 2024 Private Placement), 9,200,998 shares of our Common Stock, for a purchase price of 9.50 per share, representing the closing price of the Common Stock on March 1, 2024. The closing of the March 2024 Private Placement occurred on March 6, 2024. The gross proceeds to us from the March 2024 Private Placement were approximately 87.4 million, before deducting fees and other estimated transaction expenses. 
 
 Investment Agreement 
 
 On January 8, 2024, we entered into an investment agreement (Lantheus Investment Agreement) with Lantheus Alpha Therapy, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Lantheus Holdings, Inc. (Lantheus), pursuant to which we agreed to sell and issue to Lantheus in a private placement transaction certain shares (Lantheus Shares) of our Common Stock. The closing of the purchase and sale of the Lantheus Shares to Lantheus by us (Lantheus Closing) was subject to us raising at least 50.0 million of gross proceeds (excluding Lantheus investment) in a qualifying third-party financing transaction, which occurred on January 22, 2024. The number of Lantheus Shares sold was 5,634,235, representing 19.99 of the outstanding shares of Common Stock as of January 8, 2024. Pursuant to the Lantheus Investment Agreement, we agreed to cooperate in good faith to negotiate and enter into a registration rights agreement with Lantheus, obligating us to file a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC to register for resale the Lantheus Shares issued at the Lantheus Closing. We filed such Form S-3 on March 29, 2024, and the SEC declared it effective on April 9, 2024 (File No. 333-278362). The Lantheus Investment Agreement also contains agreements between us and Lantheus whereby Lantheus is provided certain board observer and information rights of us, as well as standstill provisions prohibiting Lantheus from taking certain actions for a specified period of time, subject to certain exceptions.

January 2024 Public Offering 
 
 On January 17, 2024, we entered into an underwriting agreement (Underwriting Agreement) with Oppenheimer Co. Inc., as representative of the underwriters named therein (Underwriters), in connection with our underwritten public offering (Public Offering) of 13,207,521 shares (Public Shares) of our Common Stock and in lieu of Public Shares to certain investors, pre-funded warrants (Jan. 2024 Pre-funded Warrants) to purchase 3,008,694 shares of Common Stock. The price to the public for the Public Shares was 3.70 per Public Share, and the price to the public for the Jan. 2024 Pre-funded Warrants was 3.69 per Jan. 2024 Pre-funded Warrant, which represents the per share price for the Public Shares less the 0.01 per share exercise price for each such Jan. 2024 Pre-funded Warrant. Under the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, we granted the Underwriters an option, exercisable for 30 days, to purchase up to an additional 2,432,432 shares of Common Stock at the same price per share as the Public Shares, which such option was fully exercised by the Underwriters on January 18, 2024. The Public Offering closed on January 22, 2024. 
 
 The gross proceeds to us from the Public Offering were approximately 69.0 million, before underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated expenses of the Public Offering. 
 
 The Public Offering was made pursuant to our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-275638), declared effective by the SEC on December 14, 2023, a base prospectus dated December 14, 2023, and the related prospectus supplement dated January 17, 2024. 
 
 The Jan. 2024 Pre-funded Warrants are exercisable at any time after the date of issuance. The exercise price and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each Jan. 2024 Pre-funded Warrant are subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of certain stock dividends and distributions, stock splits, stock combinations, reclassifications or similar events affecting the Common Stock as well as upon any distribution of assets, including cash, stock or other property, to our stockholders. The Jan. 2024 Pre-funded Warrants will not expire and are exercisable in cash or by means of a cashless exercise. A holder of Jan. 2024 Pre-funded Warrants may not exercise such Jan. 2024 Pre-funded Warrants if the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by such holder, together with its affiliates, would beneficially own more than 4.99 of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock following such exercise, as such percentage ownership is determined in accordance with the terms of the Jan. 2024 Pre-funded Warrants. A holder of Jan. 2024 Pre-funded Warrants may increase or decrease this percentage not in excess of 19.99 by providing at least 61 days prior notice to us. 
 Funding Requirements 
 We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance and expand preclinical activities, clinical trials and potential commercialization of our program candidates. Our costs will also increase as we: 
 continue the development of our clinical-stage metastatic melanoma tumor and neuroendocrine tumor assets, including VMT01 and VMT- -NET; 

continue the development of our other program candidates; 

continue to initiate and progress other supporting studies required for regulatory approval of our program candidates; 

initiate preclinical studies and clinical trials for any additional indications for our current program candidates and any future program candidates that we may pursue; 

continue to build our portfolio of program candidates through the acquisition or in-license of additional program candidates or technologies; 

continue to develop, maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; 

pursue regulatory approvals for our current and future program candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; 

continue to build our manufacturing capabilities; 

support our marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any future product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval; and 

hire additional clinical, medical, development and other personnel. 

At September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of 267.8 million. We believe our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund our current planned operations and capital investments into mid-2026. Monthly operating expenses are budgeted to increase for research and development and general and administrative expenses as management works to implement our strategy to advance our clinical assets in our clinical trials and to progress our preclinical assets towards clinical trials. Management anticipates a significant increase of expenses, particularly in research and development, as we undertake these activities. 
 27 

Table of Contents 

We expect we will need to raise additional capital until we are profitable, which may never occur. If no additional capital is raised through either additional public or private equity financings, debt financings, strategic relationships, alliances and licensing agreements, or a combination thereof, we may delay, limit or reduce discretionary spending in areas related to research and development activities and other general and administrative expenses in order to fund our operating costs and working capital needs. 
 We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect. We expect that we will require additional capital to pursue in-licenses or acquisitions of other program candidates. If we receive regulatory approvals for our program candidates, we expect to incur commercialization expenses related to program manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution, depending on where we choose to commercialize or whether we commercialize jointly or on our own. 
 Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of our program candidates, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our working capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on and could increase significantly as a result of many factors, including: 
 the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing our program candidates, and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials; 

the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our program candidates; 

the costs and timing of hiring new employees to support our continued growth; 

the costs of preparing, filing, and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims; 

the extent to which we acquire or in-license other program candidates and technologies; and 

our ability to generate cash, and successfully obtain additional working capital, to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. 

Until such time, if ever, that we can generate program revenue sufficient to achieve profitability, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of public and private equity offerings, debt financings, other third-party funding, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements or marketing and distribution arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our existing stockholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through other third-party funding, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements, outright sales of program candidates or marketing and distribution arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we will be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our program development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market programs or program candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. 
 Capital expenditures 
 Management is reviewing all aspects of research and development and general and administrative functions to evaluate the most efficient deployment of capital to ensure that the appropriate materials, systems and personnel are available to support and drive clinical trials and preclinical activities. 
 Financing activities 
 When we do require capital in the future, we expect to finance our cash needs through sales of equity, possible strategic collaborations, debt financing or through other sources that may be dilutive to existing stockholders. Management anticipates that if it raises additional financing that it will be at a discount to the market price and it will be dilutive to stockholders. 
 Other Commitments and Contingencies 
 We presented our other commitments and contingencies in our 2023 Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes outside of the ordinary course of business in those obligations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other than those disclosed in Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies , to the condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.

ITEM 3 QUAN TITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and are not required to provide the information required under this item. 
 ITEM 4 CONT ROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. However, management believes that our system of disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide a reasonable level of assurance that the objectives of the system will be met. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHE R INFORMATION 
 ITEM 1 LEG AL PROCEEDINGS 
 We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings, and we are not aware of any pending or threatened legal proceedings against us that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. 
 ITEM 1A R ISK FACTORS 
 This section augments and updates certain risk factors disclosed under the heading Risk Factors contained in Part I, Item 1A of our 2023 Form 10-K. The following risk factors should be read together with the other risk factors disclosed in the Annual Report. In addition to the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, all the risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating us and our common stock. Any of these risks, many of which are beyond our control, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, or cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. We may also face other risks and uncertainties that are not presently known, are not currently believed to be material, or are not identified below because they are common to all businesses. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. There have been no material changes in our risk factors since such 2023 Form 10-K filing. 
 We may not be successful in managing the build-out of our manufacturing facilities and associated costs or satisfying manufacturing-related regulatory requirements. 
 We have been investing in our manufacturing capabilities and recently acquired several manufacturing facilities. In March 2024, we acquired the assets and associated lease of Lantheus Holdings, Inc. s radiopharmaceutical manufacturing facility in Somerset, New Jersey. This site has three production suites that Perspective intends to utilize to supply drug product for the northeastern half of the United States. On July 15, 2024, August 2, 2024, and October 31, 2024, we purchased a building located in the Houston, Texas, metropolitan area for 4.7 million, a building in the Chicago, Illinois, metropolitan area for 5.0 million, and a building in the Los Angeles, California, metropolitan area for 11.0 million, respectively, which we intend to use for the manufacture of our program candidates upon completion of modifications and installation of equipment. The build-out of these facilities and related equipment purchases are complex and specialized and will involve substantial capital expenditures, and it could take longer, and cost more, than currently expected. Significant delays and/or cost overruns would result in higher expenditures and could be disruptive to operations, any of which could have a negative impact on our financial conditions or results of operations. 
 We also may not successfully realize the anticipated benefits from the capital expenditure at such facilities based on factors such as delays and uncertainties regarding development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates, as well as the potential to lose access to any leased facilities. Moreover, any production shortfall that impairs the supply of our product or other product candidates could negatively impact our ability to complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals and commercialize our other product candidates. A product shortfall could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 In addition, our planned operations, including our development, testing and future manufacturing activities, are subject to numerous environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, the controlled use, handling, release and disposal of and the maintenance of a registry for, hazardous materials and biological materials, such as chemical solvents, carcinogenic compounds, mutagenic compounds and compounds that may have a toxic effect on reproduction and laboratory procedures. If we fail to comply with such laws and regulations, we could be subject to fines or other sanctions. Failure to successfully complete our build-outs and successfully operate our planned manufacturing facilities and satisfy manufacturing-related regulatory requirements could adversely affect the commercial viability of our product candidates and our business. 
 ITEM 2 UNRE GISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
