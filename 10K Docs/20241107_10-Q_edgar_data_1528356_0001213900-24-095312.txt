GENIE ENERGY LTD. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 

of Genie Retail Energy GRE and varied interests in entities that comprise the Genie Renewables segment. 
 
 GRE owns and operates retail energy providers REPs ), including IDT Energy IDT Energy ), Residents Energy Residents Energy ), Town Square Energy and Town Square Energy East (collectively, "TSE"), Southern Federal Power ("Southern Federal") and Mirabito Natural Gas Mirabito ). The majority of GRE's REP customers are located in the Eastern and Midwestern United States and Texas. Mirabito supplies natural gas to commercial customers in Florida. 
 
 Genie Renewables consists of a interest in Genie Solar, an integrated solar energy company , a interest in CityCom Solar, a marketer of community solar and alternative products and services complimentary to our energy offerings and a interest in Diversegy , an energy procurement advisor. 
 
 Impairment of Assets 
 
 In 2024 , the Company discontinued several projects of Genie Solar as a result of lack of viability. The Company recognized an impairment of assets of million related to costs previously capitalized in the property and equipment accounts in the consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 One -Time Tax Credit 
 
 In the first quarter of 2023 , the Company received million in respect of a one -time tax credit related to payroll taxes incurred in prior years, which the Company recognized as a gain included in other income, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . 
 
 Discontinued Operations in Finland and Sweden 
 
 Prior to the third quarter of 2022, the Company had a third segment, Genie Retail Energy International, or GRE International, which supplied electricity to residential and small business customers in Scandinavia. However, as a result of volatility in the energy market in Europe, in the third quarter of 2022, the Company decided to discontinue the operations of Lumo Energia Oyj ("Lumo Finland") and Lumo Energi AB ("Lumo Sweden"). 
 
 The Company determined that the discontinuation of the operations of Lumo Finland and Lumo Sweden represented a strategic shift that would have a major effect on the Company's operations and financial statements. The Company accounts for these businesses as discontinued operations, and accordingly, presents the results of operations and related cash flows as discontinued operations. The results of operations and related cash flows are presented as discontinued operations for all periods. Any remaining assets and liabilities of the discontinued operations are presented separately and reflected within assets and liabilities from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . Lumo Sweden are continuing to liquidate their remaining receivables and settle any remaining liabilities. 
 
 In November 2022 , Lumo Finland declared bankruptcy and the administration of Lumo Finland was transferred to an administrator (the "Lumo Administrators"). All assets and liabilities of Lumo Finland remain with Lumo Finland, in which Genie retains its equity ownership interest, however, the management and control of Lumo Finland were transferred to the Lumo Administrators. Since the Company lost control of the management of Lumo Finland in favor of the Lumo Administrators, the accounts of Lumo Finland were deconsolidated effective November 9, 2022 . 

Following the discontinuance of operations of Lumo Finland and Lumo Sweden, GRE International ceased to be a segment and the remaining assets and liabilities and results of continuing operations of GRE International were combined with corporate. 
 
 Discontinued Operations in the United Kingdom 
 
 In October 2021 , as part of the orderly exit process from the U. K. market, Orbit Energy Limited ("Orbit"), a REP owed by the Company that used to operate in United Kingdom, and Shell U.K. Limited ("Shell") agreed to terminate the exclusive supply contract between them. As part of the termination agreement, Orbit was required to unwind all physical forward hedges with Shell which resulted in net cash proceeds after settlement of all related liabilities with Shell. 
 
 Following the termination of the contract with Shell, Orbit filed a petition with the High Court of Justice Business and Property of England and Wales (the Court to declare Orbit insolvent based on the Insolvency Act of 1986 . On November 29, 2021 , the Court declared Orbit insolvent, revoked Orbit's license to supply electricity and natural gas in the United Kingdom, ordered the current customers to be transferred to supplier of last resort and transferred the administration of Orbit to an administrator (the" Orbit Administrators") effective December 1, 2021 . 
 
 The Company determined that the discontinued operations of Orbit represented a strategic shift that would have a major effect on the Company's operations and financial statements. Since the appointment of the Orbit Administrators, the Company has accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations and accordingly, has presented the results of operations and related cash flows as discontinued operations. Since the Company lost control of the management of Orbit in favor of the Orbit Administrators, the accounts of Orbit were deconsolidated effective December 1, 2021 . 
 
 On November 21, 2023 , the Court issued an order to cease the administration and revert the control of Orbit from the Orbit Administrators to the Company effective November 28, 2023 . Following the Company regaining control of the management of Orbit, the accounts of Orbit are consolidated effective November 28, 2023 . 
 
 Seasonality and Weather ; Climate Change and Volatility in Pricing 
 
 The weather and the seasons, among other things, affect GRE s revenues. Weather conditions have a significant impact on the demand for natural gas used for heating and electricity used for heating and cooling. Typically, colder winters increase demand for natural gas and electricity, and hotter summers increase demand for electricity. Milder winters or summers have the opposite effect. Unseasonable temperatures in other periods may also impact demand levels. Natural gas revenues typically increase in the first quarter due to increased heating demands and electricity revenues typically increase in the third quarter due to increased air conditioning use. Approximately and of GRE s natural gas revenues for the relevant years were generated in the first quarters 2023 and 2022 , respectively, when demand for heating was highest. Although the demand for electricity is not as seasonal as natural gas (due, in part, to usage of electricity for both heating and cooling), approximately and of GRE s electricity revenues were generated in the third quarters of 2023 and 2022 respectively. GRE s REPs revenues and operating income are subject to material seasonal variations , and the interim financial results are not necessarily indicative of the estimated financial results for the full year. In addition, extraordinary
weather has and can lead to extreme spikes in the prices of wholesale
electricity and natural gas in markets where GRE and other retail providers
purchase their supply, or in challenges to the grid or supply markets in
affected areas. Such events could have material impacts on our margins and operations. 
 
 In addition to the direct physical impact that climate change may have on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations because of the effect on pricing, demand for our offerings and/or the energy supply markets, we may also be adversely impacted by other environmental factors, including: (i) technological advances designed to promote energy efficiency and limit environmental impact; (ii) increased competition from alternative energy sources; (iii) regulatory responses aimed at decreasing greenhouse gas emissions; and (iv) litigation or regulatory actions that address the environmental impact of our energy products and services. 

Restricted cash short-term 

Restricted cash long -term 

Total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 

Restricted cash short-term includes amounts set aside in accordance with GRE's Amended and Restated Preferred Supplier Agreement with BP Energy Company BP (see Note 19 ), Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase (see Note 20 and cash held by a wholly-owned insurance subsidiary (the "Captive") which restricted for use in order to secure the current portion of the insured liability program see Note 19 ). 
 
 Restricted cash long -term consists of cash of the
"Captive," which is restricted for use to secure the noncurrent
portion of the insured liability program (see Note 19 ). 
 
 Included in the cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is cash received from Lumo Sweden (see Note 5). 

Renewable credits 

Solar panels, net of a valuation allowanc e of and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively 

Totals 

The Company regularly
reviews the cost of inventories against their estimated net realizable value
and records write-downs if any inventories have costs in excess of their net
realizable values. There is inventory valuation allowance recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2024 . In the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company recorded an inventory valuation allowance of million to the cost of revenues. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , the Company recorded an inventory valuation allowance of million to the cost of revenues. The valuation allowances are related to write-down of inventory to its net realizable value. Solar panel inventories are transferred to ongoing solar projects of Genie Solar together with the inventory valuation allowance in the prepaid assets and property and equipment accounts in the consolidated balance sheet. 

Incumbent utility companies in most of the service territories in which GRE's REPs operate offer purchase of receivables, or POR, and GRE s REPs participate in POR programs for a majority of their receivables. The Company estimates variable consideration related to its rebate programs using the expected value method and a portfolio approach. The Company s estimates related to rebate programs are based on the terms of the rebate program, the customer s historical electricity and natural gas consumption, the customer s rate plan, and a churn factor. Taxes that are imposed on the Company s sales and collected from customers are excluded from the transaction price. 
 Revenue from sales of solar panels are recognized at a point in time following the transfer of control of the solar panels to the customer, which typically occurs upon shipment or delivery depending on the terms of the underlying contracts. For sales contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, such as the shipment or delivery of solar modules, the Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation identified in the contract based on relative standalone selling prices, or estimates of such prices, and recognize the related revenue as control of each individual product is transferred to the customer, in satisfaction of the corresponding performance obligations. Revenues from sales of solar panels are included in other revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 Genie Solar enters into contracts to identify, develop, and operate solar generation sites to provide solar electricity to its customers. Obligations under solar project contracts consist of a series of tasks and components and accordingly are accounted for as multiple performance obligations. Because the Company s performance creates and enhances assets that are controlled by and specific to customers, the Company recognizes construction services revenue over time. Revenue for these performance obligations is recognized using the input method based on the cost incurred as a percentage of total estimated contract costs. Due to the significance of the costs associated with solar panels to the total project, our judgment on when such costs should be included in the measure of progress has a material impact on revenue recognition. Contract costs include all direct material and labor costs related to contract performance. Revenues from sales of solar panels and solar panel projects are included under the Other Revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 Energy generation revenue is earned from both the sale of electricity generated from operating solar projects and the sale of Solar Energy Credits ("SRECs") which are included in the Other Revenues in the consolidated statement of operations. 
 
 Revenue from energy generation is recognized when the Company satisfies the performance obligation, which occurs at the time of the delivery of electricity at the contractual rates. 
 
 The Company applies for and receives SRECs in certain jurisdictions for power generated by solar energy systems it owns. There are no direct costs allocated to SRECs upon generation. The Company typically sells SRECs to different customers from those purchasing the energy. The sale of each SREC is a distinct performance obligation satisfied at a point in time and that the performance obligation related to each SREC is satisfied when each SREC is delivered to the customer. 
 
 Revenues from commissions from selling third-party products to customers, entry and other fees from the energy procurement advisory are recognized at the time the performance obligation is met. The Company's contacts with customers for commission revenue contain a single performance obligation and are satisfied at a point in time. 
 
 The Company recognizes the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer as an asset if it expects the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. The Company determined that certain sales commissions to acquire customers meet the requirements to be capitalized. For GRE, the Company applies a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for sales commissions to acquire customers as the period would have been one year or less.

Contract liabilities 
 Certain revenue generating contracts at Renewables include provisions that require advance payment from customers. These advance payments are recognized as revenue as the Company satisfies the performance obligations to the other party. A portion of the transaction price allocated to the performance obligations to be satisfied in future periods is recognized as a contract liability, which is expected to be satisfied in the next twelve months. Contract liabilities are included in other current liabilities account in the consolidated balance sheets.

 Lumo Fin la nd and Lumo Sweden Operations 
 
 As a result of the sustained volatility of the energy market in Europe, in the third quarter of 2022 , the Company decided to discontinue the operations of Lumo Finland and Lumo Sweden. From July 13, 2022 to July 19, 2022, the Company entered into a series of transactions to sell most of the electricity swap instruments held by Lumo Sweden. The sale price has been fixed and is expected to continue to be . 
 
 The Company determined that the discontinuation of operations of Lumo Finland and Lumo Sweden represented a strategic shift that would have a major effect on the Company's operations and financial statements and accordingly, the results of operations and related cash flows are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities of the discontinued operations are presented separately and reflected within assets and liabilities from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . Lumo Sweden is continuing to liquidate its remaining receivables and to settle any remaining liabilities. 
 
 In November 2022 , Lumo Finland declared bankruptcy and the administration of Lumo Finland was transferred to the Lumo Administrators. All assets and liabilities of Lumo Finland remain with Lumo Finland, in which Genie retains its equity ownership interest, however, the management and control of Lumo Finland were transferred to the Lumo Administrators. Since the Company lost control of the management of Lumo Finland in favor of the Lumo Administrators, the accounts of Lumo Finland were deconsolidated effective November 9, 2022 .

Prior to being treated as discontinued operations or being deconsolidated, the assets and liabilities of Lumo Finland and Lumo Sweden were included in the (former) GRE International segment. 
 
 On November 8, 2023 , the Lumo Administrators, acting on behalf of the Bankruptcy Estate, filed a claim in the District Court of Helsinki against Genie Nordic, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and the parent company of Lumo Finland, its directors, officers and affiliates, in which it alleges that the gain from the sale of swap instruments owned by Lumo Sweden amounting to million (equivalent to million as of September 30, 2024 belongs to the Bankruptcy Estate. The Bankruptcy Estate filed an additional claim with the District Court on May 27, 2024 against Lumo Sweden for million (equivalent to million as of September 30, 2024 ), also alleging that the gain from the sale of the swap instruments belongs to the Bankruptcy Estate, bringing the aggregate sum of claims related to the gain from sale of swap instruments to million (equivalent to million as of September 30, 2024 ). The Company believes that the Lumo Administrators' position is without merit, and it intends to vigorously defend its position. 
 
 Genie was also notified that the Lumo Administrators filed a claim against one of Lumo Finland s suppliers, seeking to recover payments made by Lumo Finland amounting to million (equivalent to million as of September 30, 2024 prior to the bankruptcy. Related to such payment, the Lumo Administrators have filed a recovery claim jointly against the Company and the supplier for million (equivalent to million as of September 30, 2024 alleging that a portion of the payment by Lumo Finland effectively reduced the Company's liability under the terms of a previously supplied parental guarantee (this million is included within and not additive to the million). The Lumo Administrators allege that the payments represented preferential payments and therefore belong to the bankruptcy estate which are recoverable under the laws of Finland. The Company intends to challenge the Lumo Administrators' claims. Should the Lumo Administrators succeed in clawing back the funds from the supplier, it is possible that the supplier may seek to recover its losses against the Company, under terms of the parental guarantee. At this time, there is insufficient basis to assess an amount of any probable loss. 

U.K. Operations 
 
 In the third quarter of 2021 , the natural gas and energy market in the United Kingdom deteriorated which prompted the Company to start the process of orderly withdrawal from the United Kingdom. In October 2021 , as part of the orderly exit process, Orbit and Shell agreed to terminate the exclusive supply contract between them. As part of the termination agreement, Orbit was required to unwind all physical forward hedges with Shell which resulted in net cash proceeds after settlement of all related liabilities with Shell. 
 
 Following the termination of the contract with Shell, Orbit filed a petition with the High Court of Justice Business and Property of England and Wales (the Court to declare Orbit insolvent based on the Insolvency Act of 1986 . On November 29, 2021 , the Court declared Orbit insolvent, revoked Orbit's license to supply electricity and natural gas in the United Kingdom, ordered the current customers to be transferred to supplier of last resort and transfer the administration of Orbit to the Orbit Administrators effective December 1, 2021 , which transfer was effective December 1, 2021 . All assets and liabilities of Orbit, including cash and receivables remained with Orbit and the management and control of which was transferred to Orbit Administrators. As a result of loss of control, the Company deconsolidated Orbit effective December 1, 2021 and estimated the remaining liability related to its ownership of Orbit. 
 
 The Company determined that the discontinued operations of Orbit represented a strategic shift that would have a major effect on the Company's operations and financial statements and accordingly, the results of operations and related cash flows are presented as discontinued operations effective December 1, 2021 . 
 
 On November 21, 2023 , the Court issued an order to cease the administration and revert the control of Orbit from the Orbit Administrators to the Company effective November 28, 2023 . Following the Company regaining control of the management of Orbit, the accounts of Orbit were reconsolidated effective November 28, 2023 . In 2023 , the Orbit Administrators paid the Company a return of its interest in Orbit of million (equivalent to million on the dates of transfer). 
 
 There was income or loss from discontinued operations recognized in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 . In the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , the Company recognized income from discontinued operation, net of taxes of million, mainly from the increases in the estimated value of our investments in Orbit due to a change in estimated net assets of Orbit after the expected settlement of the liabilities by the Orbit Administrators. 
 
 Prior to being treated as discontinued operations and deconsolidation, the assets and liabilities of Orbit were included in the (former) GRE International segment.

The Company s derivative contracts consist of natural gas and electricity put and call options and swaps. The underlying asset in the Company s put and call options is a forward contract. The Company s swaps are agreements whereby a floating (or market or spot) price is exchanged for a fixed price over a specified period. 
 
 The Company did not have any transfers of assets or liabilities between Level 1 , Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value measurement hierarchy during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023 . 
 Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments 
 
 The estimated fair value of the Company s other financial instruments was determined using available market information or other appropriate valuation methodologies. However, considerable judgment is required in interpreting this data to develop estimates of fair value. Consequently, the estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized or would be paid in a current market exchange. 
 
 Restricted cash short-term, trade receivables, due to IDT Corporation, other current assets and other current liabilities. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the carrying amounts of these assets and liabilities approximated fair value. The fair value estimate for restricted cash short-term was classified as Level 1 . The carrying value of other current assets, due to IDT Corporation, and other current liabilities approximated fair value . 
 
 Other assets. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , other assets included notes receivable. At September 30, 2024 , the carrying amount of the notes receivable approximated fair value. The fair values were estimated based on the Company s assumptions, and were classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
 
 The primary non-recurring fair value estimates typically are in the context of goodwill impairment testing, which involves Level 3 inputs, and asset impairments (Note 10 which utilize Level 3 inputs. 
 
 Concentration of Credit Risks 
 
 The Company holds cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash at several major financial institutions, which may exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured limits. Historically, the Company has not experienced any losses due to such concentration of credit risk. The Company s temporary cash investments policy is to limit the dollar amount of investments with any one financial institution and monitor the credit ratings of those institutions. While the Company may be exposed to credit losses due to the nonperformance of the holders of its deposits, the Company does not expect the settlement of these transactions to have a material effect on its results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 
 
 Utility companies offer purchase of receivable,
or POR, programs in most of the service territories in which GRE operates.
GRE s REPs reduce its customer credit risk by participating in POR programs
for a majority of its receivables. In addition to providing billing and
collection services, utility companies purchase those REPs receivables and
assume all credit risk without recourse to those REPs. Certain of the
utility companies represent significant portions of the Company's consolidated revenues
and consolidated trade accounts receivable balance. 
 
 The following table summarizes the percentage of consolidated trade receivable by customers that equal or exceed of consolidated net trade receivables at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (no other single customer accounted for or greater of the consolidated net trade receivable as September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023 ):

The Company determines if a contract is a lease at inception. Right-of-Use ("ROU") assets are included under other assets in the consolidated balance sheet . The current portion of the operating lease liabilities are included in other current liabilities and the noncurrent portion is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets . 

ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is the incremental borrowing rate, because the interest rate implicit in most of our leases is not readily determinable. The incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date. ROU assets also include any prepaid lease payments and lease incentives. The lease terms include periods under options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. The Company uses the base, non-cancelable, lease term when determining the lease assets and liabilities. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

 Renewable Energy Credits 
 
 GRE must obtain a certain percentage or amount of its power supply from renewable energy sources in order to meet the requirements of renewable portfolio standards in the states in which it operates. This requirement may be met by obtaining renewable energy credits that provide evidence that electricity has been generated by a qualifying renewable facility or resource. At September 30, 2024 , GRE had commitments to purchase renewable energy credits of million. 
 
 Captive Insurance Subsidiary 
 
 In December 2023 , the Company established the Captive insurance company with the primary purpose of enhancing the Company's risk financing strategies. The Captive insures the Company against certain risks unique to the operations of the Company and its subsidiaries for which insurance may not be currently available or economically feasible in today's insurance marketplace. The covered risks are both current and related to historical business activities. 
 
 The Company, with input from external experts, estimated the expected ultimate cost of: 1 claims defense cost, settlements and penalties resulting from insured risk, and 2 stranded risk which includes economic losses due to regulatory restrictions or unanticipated reduction of demand, as well as the level cost associated with contesting such restrictions. The amount of the expected loss liability for each risk is based on an analysis performed by a third-party actuary which assumed historical patterns. The key assumptions used in developing these estimates are subject to variability. 
 
 In December 2023 , the Company paid a million premium to the Captive, which is, recognized as restricted cash in the consolidated balance sheet. At September 30, 2024 , the balance of short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents of the Captive are million and million, respectively. The Captive must maintain a sufficient level of cash to fund future reserve payments and secure the insurer's liabilities, particularly those related to insured risks. The Captive has restricted alternative investments included in other current assets and other assets in the consolidated balance sheets see Note 9 ). The Company also recognized a million and million provision for captive insurance liability for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, related to the Captive's exposure for the insured risks. At September 30, 2024 , the current portion of the captive insurance liability of million is included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.

 Overview 
 
 We are comprised of Genie Retail Energy ("GRE") and Genie Renewables. 
 
 GRE owns and operates retail energy providers ("REPs"), including IDT Energy, Residents Energy, Town Square Energy ("TSE"), Southern Federal and Mirabito Natural Gas. GRE's REPs' businesses resell electricity and natural gas primarily to residential and small business customers, with the majority of the customers in the Eastern and Midwestern United States and Texas. 
 
 Genie Renewables holds our 95.5 interest in Genie Solar, an integrated solar energy company, our 92.8 interest in CityCom Solar, a marketer of community solar and alternative products and services complimentary to our energy offerings, and our 96.0 interest in Diversegy , our energy procurement advisor. 
 
 As part of our ongoing business development efforts, we seek out new opportunities, which may include complementary operations or businesses that reflect horizontal or vertical expansion from our current operations. Some of these potential opportunities are considered briefly and others are examined in further depth. In particular, we seek out acquisitions to expand the geographic scope and size of our REP businesses.

Discontinued Operations in Finland and Sweden 
 
 As a result of volatility in the energy market in Europe, in the third quarter of 2022 , we decided to discontinue the operations of Lumo Energia Oyj ("Lumo Finland") and Lumo Energi AB ("Lumo Sweden"). In July 2022, the Company entered into a series of transactions to sell most of the electricity swap instruments held by Lumo Sweden. The sale price is to be settled monthly based on the monthly commodity volume specified in the instruments from September 2022 to March 2025. The Company also entered into a series of transactions to transfer the customers of Lumo Finland and Lumo Sweden to other suppliers. 
 
 We determined that the discontinuance of operations of Lumo Finland and Lumo Sweden represented a strategic shift that would have a major effect on our operations and financial statements. We account for these businesses as discontinued operations and accordingly, present the results of operations and related cash flows as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Any remaining assets and liabilities of the discontinued operations are presented separately and are reflected within assets and liabilities from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . Lumo Sweden are continuing to liquidate its remaining receivables and to settle any remaining liabilities. 
 
 On November 7, 2022 , Lumo Finland filed a petition for bankruptcy, which was approved by the Helsinki District Court on November 9, 2022. The administration of Lumo Finland was transferred to the Lumo Administrators. All assets and liabilities of Lumo Finland remain with Lumo Finland, in which we retain our equity ownership interest, however, the management and control of Lumo Finland were transferred to the Lumo Administrators. Since the Company lost control of the management of Lumo Finland in favor of the Lumo Administrators, the accounts of Lumo Finland were deconsolidated effective November 9, 2022. 
 
 Net loss from discontinued operations of Lumo Finland and Lumo Sweden, net of taxes was minimal and 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. Net loss from discontinued operations of Lumo Finland and Lumo Sweden, net of taxes was 0.4 million and 0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. 
 
 Following the discontinuance of operations of Lumo Finland and Lumo Sweden, GRE International ceased to be a segment and the remaining assets and liabilities and results of continuing operations of GRE International were combined with corporate. 

On November 8, 2023, the Lumo Administrators, acting on behalf of the Bankruptcy Estate, filed a claim in the District Court of Helsinki against Genie Nordic, its directors, officers and affiliates, in which it alleges that the gain from the sale of swap instruments owned by Lumo Sweden amounting to 35.2 million (equivalent to 39.2 million as of September 30, 2024 belongs to the Bankruptcy Estate. The Bankruptcy Estate filed
an additional claim with the District Court on May 27,
2024 against Lumo Sweden for 4.8 
million (equivalent to 5.3 million as of September 30, 2024 ), also alleging that the gain from
the sale of the swap instruments belongs to the Bankruptcy Estate, bringing
the aggregate sum of claims related to the gain from sale of swap instruments
to 40.0 million (equivalent to 44.5 million as of September 30, 2024 ). The Company believes that the Lumo
Administrators' position is without merit, and it intends to vigorously defend
its position. 
 
 We have also been notified that the Lumo Administrators filed a claim against one of Lumo Finland s suppliers, seeking to recover payments made by Lumo Finland amounting to 4.2 million (equivalent to 4.7 million as of September 30, 2024 prior to the bankruptcy. Related to such payment, the Lumo Administrators have filed a recovery claim jointly against us and the supplier for 1.6 million (equivalent to 1.8 million as of September 30, 2024 alleging that a portion of the payment by Lumo Finland effectively reduced our liability under the terms of a previously supplied parental guarantee (this 1.6 is included within and not additive to the 4.2 million) . The Lumo Administrators allege that the payments represented preferential payments and therefore belong to the bankruptcy estate which are recoverable under the laws of Finland. We intend to challenge the Lumo Administrators' claims. Nevertheless, should the Lumo Administrators succeed in clawing back the funds from the supplier, it is possible that the supplier will seek to recover its losses against us, under terms of the parental guarantee. At this time there is insufficient basis to assess an amount of any probable loss. 

Discontinued Operations in the United Kingdom 
 
 On November 29, 2021 Orbit Energy Limited ("Orbit"), which operated in United Kingdom was declared and its customers were transferred to a supplier of last resort. Effective December 1, 2021, the administration of Orbit was transferred to a third party Administrators (the "Orbit Administrators"). The accounts of Orbit were deconsolidated from those of the Company effective December 1, 2021. 
 
 We determined that the discontinued operations of Orbit represented a strategic shift that would have a major effect on our operations and the financial statements. Since the appointment of the Orbit Administrators, we accounted their businesses as discontinued operations and accordingly, have presented the results of operations and related cash flows as discontinued operations. Any remaining assets and liabilities of the discontinued operations have been presented separately, and are reflected within assets and liabilities from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 . Since the Company lost control of the management of Orbit in favor of the Orbit Administrators, the accounts of Orbit were deconsolidated effective December 1, 2021. 

36 

On November 28, 2023, the administration of Orbit ceased and the control of Orbit reverted back to the Company from the Orbit Administrators. The accounts of Orbit were reconsolidated with those of the Company effective November 28, 2023. 
 
 There were no income or loss from discontinued operations recognized in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and in the three months ended September 30, 2023 . In the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , the Company recognized income from discontinued operation, net of taxes of 5.4 million, mainly from the increase in the estimated value of our investments in Orbit due to a change in estimated net assets of Orbit after the Orbit Administrators settle the liabilities. 
 Genie Retail Energy 
 
 GRE operates REPs that resell electricity and/or natural gas to residential and small business customers in Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Rhode Island, and Washington, D.C. GRE s revenues represented approximately 94.5 and 94.6 of our consolidated revenues in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively and 96.2 and 96.2 of our consolidated revenues in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively. 
 
 Seasonality and Weather; Climate Change and Volatility in Pricing 
 
 The weather and the seasons, among other things, affect GRE s REPs' revenues. Weather conditions have a significant impact on the demand for natural gas used for heating and electricity used for heating and cooling. Typically, colder winters increase demand for natural gas and electricity, and hotter summers increase demand for electricity. Milder winters and/or summers have the opposite effects. Unseasonable temperatures in other periods may also impact demand levels. Potential changes in global climate may produce, among other possible conditions, unusual variations in temperature and weather patterns, resulting in unusual weather conditions, more intense, frequent and extreme weather events and other natural disasters. Some climatologists believe that these extreme weather events will become more common and more extreme, which will have a greater impact on our operations. Natural gas revenues typically increase in the first quarter due to increased heating demands and electricity revenues typically increase in the third quarter due to increased air conditioning use. Approximately 48.1 and 39.7 of GRE s natural gas revenues for the relevant years were generated in the first quarter of 2023 and 2022 respectively, when demand for heating was highest. Although the demand for electricity is not as seasonal as natural gas (due, in part, to usage of electricity for both heating and cooling), approximately 32.5 and 30.5 of GRE s electricity revenues for 2023 and 2022 respectively, were generated in the third quarters of those years. GRE's REP's revenues and operating income are subject to material seasonal variations, and the interim financial results are not necessarily indicative of the estimated financial results for the full year. In addition, extraordinary
weather has and can lead to extreme spikes in the prices of wholesale
electricity and natural gas in markets where GRE and other retail providers
purchase their supply, or in challenges to the grid or supply markets in
affected areas. Such events could have material impacts on our margins and operations. 
 
 In addition to the direct physical impact that climate change may have on our business, financial condition and results of operations because of the effect on pricing, demand for our offerings and/or the energy supply markets, we may also be adversely impacted by other environmental factors, including: (i) technological advances designed to promote energy efficiency and limit environmental impact; (ii) increased competition from alternative energy sources; (iii) regulatory responses aimed at decreasing greenhouse gas emissions; and (iv) litigation or regulatory actions that address the environmental impact of our energy products and services. 

37 

Purchase of Receivables and Concentration of Credit Risk 
 
 Utility companies offer purchase of receivable, or POR, programs in most of the service territories in which GRE operates. GRE s REPs reduce their customer credit risk by participating in POR programs for a majority of their receivables. In addition to providing billing and collection services, utility companies purchase those REPs receivables and assume all credit risk without recourse to those REPs. GRE s REPs primary credit risk is therefore nonpayment by the utility companies. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 th e associated cost was approximately 1.3 of GRE's revenue and approximately 3.5 of GRE's revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 . At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , 80.2 and 84.4 , respectively, of GRE s net accounts receivable were under POR programs. Certain of the utility companies represent significant portions of our consolidated revenues and consolidated gross trade accounts receivable balance during certain periods, and such concentrations increase our risk associated with nonpayment by those utility companies. 

The following table summarizes the percentage of consolidated trade receivables by customers that equal or exceed 10.0 of consolidated net trade receivables at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (no other single customer accounted for 10.0 or greater of our consolidated net trade receivable as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023 ).

 From time to time, the Company responds to inquiries or requests for information or materials from public utility commissions or other governmental regulatory or law enforcement agencies related to investigations under statutory or regulatory schemes. The Company cannot predict whether any of those matters will lead to claims or enforcement actions or whether the Company and the regulatory parties will enter into settlements before a formal claim is made.

Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 . The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Critical accounting policies are those that require the application of management s most subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Our critical accounting policies include those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, acquisitions, goodwill, and income taxes. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. For additional discussion of our critical accounting policies, see our Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 . 
 
 Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
 
 Information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 21 Recently Issued Accounting Standards, to the current period s consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 
 We evaluate the performance of our operating business segments based primarily on income (loss) from operations. Accordingly, the income and expense line items below income (loss) from operations are only included in our discussion of our consolidated results of operations.

Revenues . Electricity revenues decreased by 11.7 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 . The decrease was due to a decrease in electricity consumption slightly offset by an increase in the average price per kilowatt hour charged to customers in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 . Electricity consumption by GRE s REPs ' customers decreased by 12.6 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to the same period in 2023 , reflecting 2.3 and 10.5 decreases in the average number of meters served and average consumption per meter, respectively . The decrease in meters served was due to an increase in the churn rates of customers related to the growth in meters served during the first half of 2024, as new customers tend to have higher rates of churn than long-standing customers. The decrease in per meter consumption in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was due to cooler than usual weather during the 2024 summer cooling season and standard fluctuations in customer consumption patterns. The average rate per kilowatt hour sold slightly increased by 1.0 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to general market conditions.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 General 
 
 We currently expect that our cash flow from operations and the 136.3 million balance of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents that we held at September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the period to November 7, 2025. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 , we had working capital (current assets less current liabilities) of 138.8 million.

Operating Activities 
 
 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was 6.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash used in operating activities of continuing operations of 32.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The decrease is due primarily to the fluctuation in the results of operations in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 . 
 
 Our cash flow from operations varies significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year, depending on our operating results and the timing of operating cash receipts and payments, specifically trade accounts receivable and trade accounts payable. Changes in assets and liabilities decreased cash flows by 24.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to the same period in 2023 . 
 
 Certain of GRE's REPs are party to an Amended and Restated Preferred Supplier Agreement with BP Energy Company, or BP, which is to be in effect through November 30, 2023. Under the agreement, the REPs purchase electricity and natural gas at market rate plus a fee. The obligations to BP are secured by a first security interest in deposits or receivables from utilities in connection with their purchase of the REP s customer s receivables, and in any cash deposits or letters of credit posted in connection with any collateral accounts with BP. The ability to purchase electricity and natural gas under this agreement is subject to satisfaction of certain conditions including the maintenance of certain covenants. At September 30, 2024 , we were in compliance with such covenants. At September 30, 2024 , restricted cash short-term of 0.5 million and trade accounts receivable of 56.8 million were pledged to BP as collateral for the payment of trade accounts payable to BP of 17.6 million at September 30, 2024 . 
 
 We had purchase commitments of 92.5 million at September 30, 2024 , of which 76.4 million was for purchases of electricity. 
 
 As discussed above, in December 2023, we established the Captive insurance subsidiary. At September 30, 2024 , the balance of short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents of the Captive are 3.9 million and 47.3 million, respectively. We also recognized 2.7 million provision for captive insurance liability for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , related to Captive's exposure for the insured risks. At September 30, 2024 , the current captive insurance liability of 0.5 million is included in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. The amount of the expected loss liability for each risk is based on an analysis performed by a third-party actuary which assumed historical patterns. The key assumptions used in developing these estimates are subject to variability. 
 
 We are a lessee under operating lease agreements primarily for office space in locations where we operate and for our solar development projects with lease periods expiring between 2024 and 2052 . Our future lease payments under the operating leases as of September 30, 2024 were 3.6 milli on. 
 
 GRE has performance bonds issued through a third party for the benefit of certain utility companies and for various states in order to comply with the states financial requirements for retail energy providers. At September 30, 2024 , we had outstanding aggregate performance bonds of 26.7 million and a minimal amount of unused letters of credit. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Our capital expenditures increased 3.1 million to 4.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 .

The Company paid 1.8 million to the seller and signed a note payable to the seller for 1.8 million, payable in full on February 1, 2026 . The note payable carries a 5.0 interest rate payable in full on February 1, 2026 . In the third quarter of 2024 , Howard Jonas, reimbursed the Company 0.9 million, representing the purchase price for his 49.0 share in the investment property and is included in the noncontrolling interest in our consolidated balance sheets. At September 30, 2024 , 3.6 million was outstanding under the note payable with an effective interest rate of 5.0 . 
 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , we acquired minimal interests in various ventures for an aggregate amount of investments of 4.0 million and 5.9 million, respectively.

Item 3 . Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks. 

Our primary market risk exposure is the price applicable to our natural gas and electricity purchases and sales. The sales price of our natural gas and electricity is primarily driven by the prevailing market price. Hypothetically, for our GRE segment, if our gross profit per unit in the three months ended September 30, 2024 had remained the same as in the three months ended September 30, 2023 , our gross profit from electricity would have increased by 0.3 million and our gross profit from natural gas would have decreased 0.3 million. Hypothetically, for our GRE segment, if our gross profit per unit in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 had remained the same as in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , our gross profit from electricity and natural gas sales would have increased by 18.2 million and our gross profit from natural gas would have decreased 4.8 million. 
 
 The energy markets have historically been very volatile, and we can reasonably expect that electricity and natural gas prices will be subject to fluctuations in the future. In an effort to reduce the effects of the volatility of the price of electricity and natural gas on our operations, we have adopted a policy of hedging electricity and natural gas prices from time to time, at relatively lower volumes, primarily through the use of put and call options and swaps. While the use of these hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements, it also limits future gains from favorable movements. We do not apply hedge accounting to these options or swaps, therefore the mark-to-market change in fair value is recognized in cost of revenue in our consolidated statements of operations. We recognized losses from derivative instruments of 6.2 million and 20.1 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, and losses of 4.5 million and 21.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 from our derivative instruments. Refer to Note 7 Derivative Instruments , for details of the hedging activities. 

Item 4 . Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in R ules 13 a- 15 (e) and 15 d- 15 (e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , as amended), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 . 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. T here were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
