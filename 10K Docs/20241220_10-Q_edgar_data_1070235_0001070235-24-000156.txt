 Accounting Standards Adopted During Fiscal 2025 
 In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB issued ASU 2023-07 on the topic of segment reporting. The standard requires additional disclosures for segment reporting. These requirements include: (i) disclosure of significant expenses that are regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss (collectively referred to as the significant expense principle (ii) disclosure of an amount for other segment items (equal to the difference between segment revenue less segment expenses disclosed under the significant expense principle and each reported measure of segment profit or loss) by reportable segment and a description of their composition; (iii) annual disclosure of a reportable segment s profit or loss and assets currently required by Topic 280 in interim periods; (iv) clarification that, if the CODM uses more than one measure of a segment's profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources, a public entity may report those additional measures of segment profit or loss; (v) disclosure of the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources; and (vi) requiring a public entity that has a single reportable segment provide all the disclosures required by the amendments in this ASU, and all existing segment disclosures in Topic 280. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company early adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and have provided the applicable disclosures in Note 11.

from the fair values determined by the Company are communicated to the independent third-party valuator for consideration of reasonableness. The independent third-party valuator considers the information provided by the Company before determining whether a change in their original pricing is warranted. 
 When the Company concludes that there is a significant financing component included within a contract with a customer due to timing differences between the fulfillment of certain performance obligations and the receipt of payment for those performance obligations, the Company determines the present value of the future consideration utilizing the discount rate that would be reflected in a separate financing transaction between the customer and the Company at contract inception based upon the credit characteristics of the customer receiving financing in the contract. 
 For a description of how the fair value of the 2020 Debentures (as defined in Note 6) was determined, see the Convertible debentures accounting policies in Note 1 to the Annual Financial Statements. 
 Non-Recurring Fair Value Measurements 
 Upon the occurrence of certain events, the Company re-measures the fair value of non-marketable equity investments for which it utilizes the measurement alternative, and long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, operating lease ROU assets, intangible assets and goodwill if an impairment or observable price adjustment is recognized in the current period. 
 Non-Marketable Equity Investments Measured Using the Measurement Alternative 
 Non-marketable equity investments measured using the measurement alternative include investments in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values in which the Company does not own a controlling interest or have significant influence. The estimation of fair value used in the fair value measurements required the use of significant unobservable inputs, and as a result, the fair value measurements were classified as Level 3. 
 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
 The Company exited certain leased facilities and recorded a pre-tax and after-tax impairment charge of million and million during the three and nine months ended November 30, 2024, respectively, related to the operating lease right-of-use ROU assets and property, plant and equipment associated with those facilities (three and nine months ended November 30, 2023 - million). The impairment was determined by comparing the fair value of the impacted ROU asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment measurement date, as required under ASC 360, using Level 3 inputs. The fair value of the ROU asset was based on the estimated sublease income for certain facilities taking into consideration the estimated time period it will take to obtain a sublessor, the applicable discount rate and the sublease rate, which are considered unobservable inputs. The Company conducts an evaluation of the related liabilities and expenses and revises its assumptions and estimates as appropriate as new or updated information becomes available. The fair value measurement of ROU impaired assets is classified as Level 3. 
 The Company conducts regular reviews of the individual patents, both organically generated and acquired, comprising its patent portfolio. As a result of this review, for the three and nine months ended November 30, 2023, the Company determined it has an indicator of impairment, as it had ceased enforcement and abandoned the legal right and title to patents with a cost of million, accumulated amortization of million, and a net book value of million, which is classified as an impairment of long-lived assets on the Company s consolidated statements of operations.

 compared to a net effective income tax expense rate of for the nine months ended November 30, 2023. The Company s income tax rate reflects the change in unrecognized income tax benefit, if any, and the fact that the Company has a significant valuation allowance against its deferred income tax assets; in particular, any change in loss carry forwards or research and development credits, amongst other items, is offset by a corresponding adjustment of the valuation allowance. The Company s net effective income tax rate also reflects the geographic mix of earnings in jurisdictions with different income tax rates. 
 The Company s total unrecognized income tax benefits as at November 30, 2024 were million (February 29, 2024 - million).

 On November 17, 2023, the Company issued million aggregate principal amount of 1.75 extendible convertible unsecured debentures (the Extension Debentures in a private placement to certain controlled affiliates of Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited Fairfax ).

 Due to the conversion option and other embedded derivatives within the Prior Debentures, the Company elected to record the Prior Debentures, including the debt itself and all embedded derivatives, at fair value and presented the Prior Debentures as a single hybrid financial instrument.

The fair value of the 2020 Debentures was determined using the significant Level 2 inputs interest rate curves, the market price and volatility of the Company s listed common shares, and the significant Level 3 inputs related to credit spread and the implied discount of the 2020 Debentures at issuance. The fair value of the Extension Debentures was determined using observable interest rate curves, and the market price and volatility of the Company s common shares.

Patent Sale 
 On May 11, 2023, the Company completed the sale of certain non-core patent assets to Malikie Innovations Limited for million in cash on closing, an additional million in fixed consideration due by no later than the third anniversary of closing and variable consideration in the form of future royalties in the aggregate amount of up to million (the Malikie Transaction ). Pursuant to the terms of the Malikie Transaction, the Company received a license back to the patents sold, which relate primarily to mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking. 
 In the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company recognized revenue of million and cost of sales of million related to intellectual property sold. As at November 30, 2024, the remaining financing component on the patent sale was million and will be recognized as interest income over the payment terms. 
 The Company estimated variable consideration from future royalty revenues using an expected value method including inputs from both internal and external sources related to patent monetization activities and cash flows, and constrained the recognition of that variable consideration based on the Company s accounting policies and critical accounting estimates as described in Note 1. The present value of variable consideration recognized as revenue was million and the amount of variable consideration constrained was million. The Company evaluates its conclusions as to whether the constraints are still applicable on an ongoing basis, and will make updates when it observes a sufficient amount of evidence that amounts of variable consideration are no longer subject to constraint or the estimated amount of variable consideration has changed.

Other expenses, consisting mainly of salaries and certain other operating costs, were incurred primarily in Canadian dollars, but were also incurred in U.S. dollars, euros and British pounds. At November 30, 2024, approximately of cash and cash equivalents, of accounts receivable and of accounts payable were denominated in foreign currencies (February 29, 2024 , and , respectively).

As part of its risk management strategy, the Company maintains net monetary asset and/or liability balances in foreign currencies and engages in foreign currency hedging activities using derivative financial instruments, including currency forward contracts and currency options. The Company does not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes. 
 Interest rate risk 
 Cash and cash equivalents and investments are invested in certain instruments with fixed interest rates of varying maturities. Consequently, the Company is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of holding investments of varying maturities and the significant financing components within certain revenue contracts with customers. The fair value of investments, as well as the investment income derived from the investment portfolio, will fluctuate with changes in prevailing interest rates. The Company also has significant financing components within certain revenue contracts with customers and is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of discounting the future payments from customers with a fixed interest rate. The Company has also issued Notes with a fixed interest rate, as described in Note 6. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of the Notes. The Company does not currently utilize interest rate derivative instruments. 
 Credit risk 
 The Company is exposed to market and credit risk on its investment portfolio. The Company is also exposed to credit risk with customers, as described in Note 4. The Company reduces this risk from its investment portfolio by investing in liquid, investment-grade securities and by limiting exposure to any one entity or group of related entities. As at November 30, 2024, no single issuer represented more than of the total cash, cash equivalents and investments (February 29, 2024 - no single issuer represented more than of the total cash, cash equivalents and investments), with the largest such issuer representing bearer deposits, term deposits and cash balances with one of the Company s banking counterparties. 
 Liquidity risk 
 million as at November 30, 2024. The Company s management remains focused on efficiently managing working capital balances and managing the liquidity needs of the business. Based on its current financial projections, the Company believes its financial resources, together with expected future operating cash generating and operating expense reduction activities, should be sufficient to meet funding requirements for current financial commitments and future operating expenditures not yet committed, and should provide the necessary financial capacity for the foreseeable future.

 Cylance 
 On October 16, 2024, the Company announced that it was revisiting capital allocation priorities, noting that estimates of the level of investment required to grow the Cylance business to scale and profitability would be substantial and would require a number of years and, as such, the Company would begin exploring opportunities for the business. At November 30, 2024, the Company determined that the assets and liabilities constituting the Cylance business met the criteria requiring them to be classified as held for sale as specified in Accounting Standards Codification ASC 360 Property, Plant and Equipment, which in turn meant that the Cylance business met the criteria for presentation as a discontinued operations under ASC 205 Presentation of Financial Statements. While presented as a discontinued operations in its Consolidated Statement of Operations, the Company continues to operate Cylance during the time that the assets and liabilities constituting its business are held for sale. As a result of Cylance becoming a discontinued operation, it is no longer reported alongside UEM, SecuSuite and AtHoc as the Cybersecurity segment, and those three businesses are now reported separately from Cylance as the Secure Communications segment. 
 On December 15, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to sell the Company s Cylance endpoint security assets to Arctic Wolf for a purchase price consisting of 160 million of cash, subject to certain purchase price adjustments (the Cash Consideration ), and 5.5 million common shares in Arctic Wolf.

 Financial Highlights 
 The Company had 266 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments as of November 30, 2024 (February 29, 2024 - 298 million). 
 In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company recognized revenue from continuing operations of 143 million and incurred a net loss of 11 million, or 0.02 basic and diluted loss per share, on a U.S. GAAP basis (third quarter of fiscal 2024 - revenue from continuing operations of 152 million and net loss of 21 million, or 0.04 basic loss per share and 0.05 diluted loss per share). 
 The Company recognized adjusted net income of 12 million, and adjusted earnings of 0.02 per share, on a non-GAAP basis in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 (third quarter of fiscal 2024 - adjusted net income of 3 million, and adjusted earnings of 0.01 per share). See Non-GAAP Financial Measures below. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and information contained in this MD A is presented on that basis. On December 19, 2024, the Company announced financial results for the three and nine months ended November 30, 2024, which included certain non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios, including revenue from continuing and discontinued operation, Cybersecurity revenue from continuing and discontinued operations, adjusted gross margin, adjusted gross margin percentage, Cybersecurity gross margin from continuing and discontinued operations, adjusted gross margin from continuing and discontinued operations, adjusted gross margin percentage from continuing and discontinued operations, adjusted operating expense, adjusted operating expense from continuing and discontinued operations, adjusted net income (loss), adjusted earnings (loss) per share, adjusted research and development expense, adjusted sales and marketing expense, adjusted general and administrative expense, adjusted amortization expense, adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted EBITDA from continuing and discontinued operations, adjusted Cybersecurity EBITDA from continuing and discontinued operations and free cash flow (usage). 
 In the Company s internal reports, management evaluates the performance of the Company s business on a non-GAAP basis by excluding the impact of certain items below from the Company s U.S. GAAP financial results. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios provide management, as well as readers of the Company s financial statements, with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and are useful in helping management and readers 
 40 

understand the Company s operating results and underlying operational trends. Non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios exclude certain amounts as described below: 
 Prior Debentures fair value adjustment . The Company elected to measure the Prior Debentures at fair value in accordance with the fair value option under U.S. GAAP. Each period, the fair value of the Prior Debentures were recalculated and the resulting non-cash income and charges from the change in fair value from non-credit components of the Prior Debentures were recognized in income. The amount varied each period depending on changes to the Company s share price, share price volatility and credit indices. This was not indicative of the Company s core operating performance, and may not be meaningful when comparing the Company s operating performance against that of prior periods. 
 Restructuring charges . The Company believes that restructuring costs relating to employee termination benefits, facilities, streamlining many of the Company s centralized corporate functions into Secure Communications (previously Cybersecurity) and IoT specific teams, and other costs pursuant to programs to reduce the Company s annual expenses amongst R D, infrastructure and other functions do not reflect expected future operating expenses, are not indicative of the Company s core operating performance, and may not be meaningful when comparing the Company s operating performance against that of prior periods. 
 Stock compensation expenses . Equity compensation is a non-cash expense and does not impact the ongoing operating decisions taken by the Company s management. 
 Amortization of acquired intangible assets. When the Company acquires intangible assets through business combinations, the assets are recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation. Such acquired intangible assets depreciate over time and the related amortization will recur in future periods until the assets have been fully amortized. This is not indicative of the Company s core operating performance, and may not be meaningful when comparing the Company s operating performance against that of prior periods. 
 Long-lived asset impairment charge. The Company believes that long-lived asset impairment charges do not reflect expected future operating expenses, are not indicative of the Company s core operating performance, and may not be meaningful when comparing the Company s operating performance against that of prior periods. 
 On a U.S. GAAP basis, the impacts of these items are reflected in the Company s income statement. However, the Company believes that the provision of supplemental non-GAAP measures allows investors to evaluate the financial performance of the Company s business using the same evaluation measures that management uses, and is therefore a useful indication of the Company s performance or expected performance of future operations and facilitates period-to-period comparison of operating performance. As a result, the Company considers it appropriate and reasonable to provide, in addition to U.S. GAAP measures, supplementary non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain items from the presentation of its financial results.

Reconciliation of non-GAAP based measures with most directly comparable U.S. GAAP based measures for the three months ended November 30, 2024 and November 30, 2023 
 Readers are cautioned that revenue from continuing and discontinued operation, Cybersecurity revenue from continuing and discontinued operations, adjusted gross margin, adjusted gross margin percentage, Cybersecurity gross margin from continuing and discontinued operations, adjusted gross margin from continuing and discontinued operations, adjusted gross margin percentage from continuing and discontinued operations, adjusted operating expense, adjusted operating expense from continuing and discontinued operations, adjusted net income (loss), adjusted earnings (loss) per share, adjusted research and development expense, adjusted sales and marketing expense, adjusted general and administrative expense, adjusted amortization expense, adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted EBITDA from continuing and discontinued operations, adjusted Cybersecurity EBITDA from continuing and discontinued operations and free cash flow (usage) and similar measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in the context of the U.S. GAAP results, which are described in this MD A and presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company uses free cash flow (usage) when assessing its sources of liquidity, capital resources, and quality of earnings. The Company believes that free cash flow (usage) is helpful in understanding the Company s capital requirements and provides an additional means to reflect the cash flow trends in the Company s business. 
 Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended November 30, 2024 and November 30, 2023 to free cash flow (usage) is reflected in the table below:

 Key Metrics 
 The Company regularly monitors a number of financial and operating metrics, including the following key metrics, in order to measure the Company s current performance and estimated future performance. Readers are cautioned that annual recurring revenue ARR ), dollar-based net retention rate DBNRR ), and recurring revenue percentage do not have any standardized meaning and are unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Each of Cybersecurity ARR, DBNRR, and recurring revenue percentage includes both continuing operations and discontinued operations. 
 Comparative breakdowns of certain key metrics for the three months ended or as at November 30, 2024 and November 30, 2023 are set forth below. 
 For the Three Months Ended (in millions) November 30, 2024 November 30, 2023 Change Cybersecurity Annual Recurring Revenue 281 273 8 Secure Communications Annual Recurring Revenue 215 199 16 Cybersecurity Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate 90 82 8 Secure Communications Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate 95 91 4 Recurring Software Product Revenue Percentage 80 ~ 70 10 
 Annual Recurring Revenue 
 The Company defines ARR as the annualized value of all subscription, term, maintenance, services, and royalty contracts that generate recurring revenue as of the end of the reporting period. The Company previously used ARR as an indicator of business momentum for the Cybersecurity business and currently uses ARR as an indicator of business momentum for the Secure Communications business. 
 Cybersecurity ARR was approximately 281 million as at November 30, 2024 and increased compared to 279 million as at August 31, 2024 and increased compared to 273 million as at November 30, 2023. 
 
 Secure Communications ARR was approximately 215 million as at November 30, 2024 and increased compared to 209 million as at August 31, 2024 and increased compared to 199 million as at November 30, 2023. 
 Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate 
 The Company calculates the Cybersecurity and Secure Communications DBNRR as of period end by first calculating the Cybersecurity ARR and Secure Communications ARR, respectively, from the customer base as at 12 months prior to the current period end Prior Period ARR ). The Company then calculates the Cybersecurity and Secure Communications ARR for the same cohort of customers as at the current period end Current Period ARR ). The Company then divides the Current Period ARR by the Prior Period ARR to calculate the DBNRR. 
 Cybersecurity DBNRR was 90 as at November 30, 2024 and increased compared to 88 as at August 31, 2024 and increased compared to 82 as at November 30, 2023. 
 Secure Communications DBNRR was 95 as at November 30, 2024 and increased compared to 93 as at August 31, 2024 and increased compared to 91 as at November 30, 2023.

Recurring Software Product Revenue Percentage 
 The Company defines recurring software product revenue percentage as recurring software product revenue divided by total software and services revenue. Recurring software product revenue is comprised of subscription and term licenses, maintenance arrangements, royalty arrangements and perpetual licenses recognized ratably under ASC 606. Total software and services revenue is comprised of recurring product revenue, non-recurring product revenue and professional services. The Company uses recurring software product revenue percentage to provide visibility into the revenue expected to be recognized in the current and future periods. 
 Total software and services product revenue, excluding professional services, was approximately 80 recurring for the three months ended November 30, 2024 and was consistent with approximately 80 recurring for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and increased from approximately 70 for the three months ended November 30, 2023 due to product mix.

 Revenue by Segment 
 Comparative breakdowns of revenue by segment are set forth below. 
 For the Three Months Ended 
 (in millions) 
 November 30, 2024 November 30, 2023 Change Revenue by Segment Secure Communications 74 91 (17) IoT 62 55 7 Licensing 7 6 1 143 152 (9) Revenue by Segment Secure Communications 51.7 59.9 IoT 43.4 36.2 Licensing 4.9 3.9 100.0 100.0 
 Secure Communications 
 The decrease in Secure Communications revenue of 17 million was primarily due to a decrease of 17 million in product revenue in Secusmart, a decrease of 1 million of BlackBerry UEM licenses revenue and a decrease of 1 million in BlackBerry AtHoc, partially offset by an increase of 2 million in professional services. 
 The Company previously stated that it expected Cybersecurity revenue to be in the range of 86 million to 90 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2025. Cybersecurity revenue (consisting of Secure Communications plus Cylance) was 93 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, higher than expected due to strong Secusmart revenue. 
 The Company expects Secure Communications revenue to be in the range of 62 million to 66 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. 
 The Company previously stated that it expected Cybersecurity revenue to be in the range of 345 million to 365 million in each of fiscal years 2026 and 2027. Due to the reporting of the Cylance business as a discontinued operation, the Company is retracting this guidance. 
 IoT 
 The increase in IoT revenue of 7 million was primarily due to an increase of 5 million in BlackBerry QNX royalty revenue, an increase of 2 million in BlackBerry QNX development seat revenue, and an increase of 1 million in BlackBerry Radar, partially offset by a decrease of 2 million in professional services revenue. 
 The Company previously stated that it expected IoT revenue to be in the range of 56 million to 60 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2025. IoT revenue was 62 million due to stronger than expected BlackBerry QNX royalty revenue. 
 The Company expects IoT revenue to be in the range of 60 million to 65 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. 
 49 

The Company previously stated that it expected IoT revenue to be in the range of 225 million to 235 million in fiscal 2025. The Company now expects IoT revenue to be in the range of 230 million to 235 million in fiscal 2025 due to stronger than expected BlackBerry QNX revenue in the first nine months of fiscal 2025. 
 The Company expects IoT revenue to be in the range of 260 million to 270 million in fiscal 2026 and to be in the range of 295 million to 305 million in fiscal 2027. 
 Licensing 
 The increase in Licensing revenue was 1 million. 
 The Company previously stated that it expected revenue from intellectual property licensing to be approximately 4 million in each of the four quarters of fiscal 2025. Intellectual property licensing revenue was 7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2025. 
 The Company expects Licensing revenue of 16 million in each of fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2027. 
 Total BlackBerry Revenue 
 The Company previously stated that it expected total BlackBerry revenue to be in the range of 146 million to 154 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2025. Total BlackBerry revenue from both continuing and discontinued operations was 162 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, better than expected due to the reasons noted above. 
 The Company expects total BlackBerry revenue from continuing operations to be in the range of 126 million to 135 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. The Company previously stated that it expected total BlackBerry revenue to be in the range of 591 million to 616 million in fiscal 2025, to be in the range of 620 million to 650 million in fiscal 2026 and to be in the range of 655 million to 685 million in fiscal 2027. Due to the reporting of the Cylance business as a discontinued operation, the Company is retracting this guidance, and expects total BlackBerry revenue from continuing operations to be in the range of 517 million and 526 million for fiscal 2025 as a whole.

 Europe, Middle East and Africa Revenue 
 The increase in Europe, Middle East and Africa revenue of 6 million was primarily due to an increase of 9 million relating to product revenue in Secusmart, partially offset by a decrease of 2 million in BlackBerry QNX royalty revenue, and a decrease of 1 million in BlackBerry UEM license revenue. 
 50 

Other Regions Revenue 
 The decrease in Other regions revenue of 16 million was primarily due to a decrease of 25 million relating to revenue from the Company s agreement with the Government of Malaysia in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 that did not recur, partially offset by an increase of 4 million in QNX royalty revenue, an increase of 2 million in professional services and an increase of 2 million in BlackBerry QNX development seat revenue. 
 Gross Margin 
 Consolidated Gross Margin 
 Consolidated gross margin decreased by 7 million to approximately 112 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 (third quarter of fiscal 2024 - 119 million). The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in revenue from Secusmart, partially offset by an increase in revenue from BlackBerry UEM and BlackBerry QNX due to the reasons discussed above in Revenue by Segment , as the cost of sales for most software and services products does not significantly fluctuate based on business volume. 
 Consolidated Gross Margin Percentage

 U.S. GAAP Operating Expenses 
 Operating expenses increased by 8 million sequentially, or 9.4 , in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2025 primarily due to an increase of 6 million in restructuring costs, an increase of 1 million in the Company s deferred share unit costs, and an increase of 1 million in marketing and advertising costs. 
 Operating expenses decreased by 8 million year-over-year, or 7.9 , in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2024 primarily due to a decrease of 10 million in salaries and benefits expenses, a decrease of 8 million in impairment of long-lived assets, a decrease of 2 million in facilities cost, a decrease of 2 million in marketing and advertising costs, and a decrease of 2 million in amortization expense, partially offset by the fair value adjustment related to the Prior Debentures incurred in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 of 13 million which did not recur, and an increase of 4 million in the Company s deferred share unit costs. 
 Adjusted Operating Expenses 
 Adjusted operating expenses increased by 2 million sequentially, or 2.6 , to 79 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to 77 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025.

 Adjusted operating expenses decreased by 9 million year-over-year, or 10.2 , to 79 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to 88 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 10 million in salaries and benefits expenses, a decrease of 2 million in facilities cost, a decrease of 2 million in marketing and advertising costs, and a decrease of 1 million in amortization expense, partially offset by an increase of 4 million in the Company s deferred share unit costs. 
 53 

The Company previously stated that it expected its average quarterly non-GAAP operating expense run rate to be approximately 110 million in fiscal 2025. Non-GAAP operating expense was 101 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2025. Due to the reporting of the Cylance business as a discontinued operation, the Company is retracting this guidance.

 Adjusted sales and marketing expenses decreased by 3 million, or 12.0 , to 22 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to 25 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease was primarily due to the same reasons described above on a U.S. GAAP basis. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administration expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits, external advisory fees, information technology costs, office and related staffing infrastructure costs. 
 General and administrative expenses decreased by 7 million, or 15.6 , in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2024.

 Amortization included in Operating Expense 
 The decrease in amortization expense included in operating expense of 2 million was primarily due to the lower cost base of acquired technology assets. 
 Adjusted amortization expense decreased by 2 million to 2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to 4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was primarily due to the lower cost base of assets. 
 Amortization included in Cost of Sales 
 Amortization expense relating to certain property, plant and equipment and certain intangible assets employed in the Company s service operations decreased by 2 million to 2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to 1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 due to an increase in patent amortization expense included in cost of sales. 
 Investment Income, Net 
 Investment income, net, which includes the interest expense from the Debentures (as defined in Financial Condition - Debt Financing and Other Funding Sources ), was nil in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 and decreased by 5 million from investment income, net of 5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 primarily due to unrealized losses recognized from observable price changes on non-marketable equity investments without readily determinable fair value in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 and a lower yield on cash and investments. 
 Income Taxes 
 For the third quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company s net effective income tax expense rate was approximately 175 (third quarter of fiscal 2024 - net effective income tax expense rate of approximately 250 ). The Company s net effective income tax rate reflects the change in unrecognized income tax benefits, if any, and the fact that the Company has a significant valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets; in particular, any change in loss carry forwards or research and development credits, amongst other items, was offset by a corresponding adjustment of the valuation allowance. The Company s net effective income tax rate also reflects the geographic mix of earnings in jurisdictions with different income tax rates. 
 Net Income (loss) 
 The Company s net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 was 12 million, or 0.02 basic and diluted earnings per share on a U.S. GAAP basis (third quarter of fiscal 2024 - net income from continuing operations of 8 million, or 0.01 basic earnings per share and 0.01 diluted loss per share). The increase in net income of 4 million was primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses, as described above in Operating Expenses , partially offset by a decrease in revenue, as described above in Revenue by Segment . 
 The Company s net loss from discontinued operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 was 23 million, or 0.04 basic and diluted loss per share on a U.S. GAAP basis (third quarter of fiscal 2024 - net loss from discontinued operations of 29 million, or 0.05 basic loss per share and 0.06 diluted loss per share). The decrease in net loss of 6 million was primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses primarily due to a decrease in salaries and benefits expense, partially offset by a decrease in revenue in Cylance cybersecurity solutions. 
 55 

Adjusted net income was 12 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, or 0.02 adjusted basic loss per share (third quarter of fiscal 2024 - adjusted net income of 3 million, or 0.01 adjusted basic loss per share). The increase in adjusted net income of 9 million was primarily due to the same reasons described above on a U.S. GAAP basis. 
 The Company previously stated that it expected a sequential improvement in operating cash flow in the third quarter of fiscal 2025. Operating cash flow usage was 3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 and improved sequentially compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2025. 
 The Company previously stated that it expected non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of 0.01) to 0.01, adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of breakeven to 10 million and adjusted EBITDA to improve sequentially in the third quarter of fiscal 2025. Non-GAAP EPS was 0.02 and adjusted EBITDA was 23 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 due to strong revenue and lower-than-expected operating costs and improved sequentially in the third quarter of fiscal 2025. 
 The Company previously stated it expected adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of 0 million to 10 million in fiscal 2025, to be in the range of 50 million to 65 million in fiscal 2026 and to be in the range of 80 million to 95 million in fiscal 2027. Due to the reporting of the Cylance business as a discontinued operation, the Company is retracting this guidance. The Company now expects total Company adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations to be in the range of 60 million to 70 million in fiscal 2025 and total Company adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations to be in the range of 10 million to 20 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. 
 The Company previously stated it expected adjusted EBITDA margin percentage to be 2 in fiscal 2025, 10 in fiscal 2026 and 14 in fiscal 2027. Due to the reporting of the Cylance business as a discontinued operation, the Company is retracting this guidance. 
 The Company expects the impact to adjusted EBITDA from its Corporate functions to be approximately 48 million in fiscal 2025, 40 million in fiscal 2026, and 35 million in fiscal 2027. 
 The Company expects non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of 0.01) and 0.01 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. The Company previously stated that it expected non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of 0.05) to 0.02) for fiscal 2025 as a whole. Due to the reporting of the Cylance business as a discontinued operation, the Company is retracting this guidance and now expects non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of 0.02) to breakeven for fiscal 2025. 
 The Company does not provide a reconciliation of expected adjusted EBITDA and expected Non-GAAP basic EPS for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025 to the most directly comparable expected GAAP measures because it is unable to predict with reasonable certainty, among other things, restructuring charges and impairment charges and, accordingly, a reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on GAAP reported results for the guidance period. 
 The weighted average number of shares outstanding was 591 million common shares for basic and diluted loss per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 (third quarter of fiscal 2024 - 584 million common shares for basic and diluted loss per share).

Consolidated Gross Margin 
 Consolidated gross margin decreased by 78 million to approximately 289 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2025 (first nine months of fiscal 2024 - 367 million). The decrease was primarily due to the patent sale in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, which was a one-time event, and a decrease in product revenue in Secusmart, partially offset by an increase in revenue from BlackBerry QNX due to the reasons discussed above in Revenue by Segment , as the cost of sales for most software and services products does not significantly fluctuate based on business volume. 
 Consolidated Gross Margin Percentage 
 Consolidated gross margin percentage increased by 13.3 , to approximately 73.9 of consolidated revenue in the first nine months of fiscal 2025 (first nine months of fiscal 2024 - 60.6 ). The increase was primarily due to a change in mix, specifically a higher gross margin contribution from BlackBerry QNX, and a lower gross margin contribution from Licensing, which had a lower relative gross margin percentage in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 due to the patent sale.

The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 31 million in salaries and benefits expense, a decrease of 11 million in legal expense, a decrease of 8 million in amortization costs, a decrease of 8 million in stock compensation costs, a decrease of 8 million in facilities costs, a decrease of 5 million in impairment of long-lived assets, a decrease of 7 million in consulting expense, and a decrease of 4 million in credit loss provision, partially offset by an increase of 17 million related to the release of an accrued liability relating to the Company s legacy mobile device business in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 which did not recur and an increase of 10 million in variable incentive plan cost. 
 60 

Adjusted Operating Expenses 
 Adjusted operating expenses decreased by 40 million, or 14.2 , to 242 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2025, compared to 282 million the first nine months of 2024. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 31 million in salaries and benefits expense, a decrease of 11 million in legal expense, a decrease of 8 million in facilities costs, a decrease of 7 million in consulting expense, a decrease of 4 million in amortization costs, and a decrease of 4 million in credit loss provision, partially offset by an increase of 17 million related to the release of an accrued liability relating to the Company s legacy mobile device business in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 which did not recur and an increase of 10 million in variable incentive plan cost. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for technical personnel, new product development costs, travel, office and building costs, infrastructure costs and other employee costs. 
 Research and development expenses decreased by 13 million, or 13.3 , in the first nine months of fiscal 2025, compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2024. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 10 million in salaries and benefits expenses, and a decrease of 6 million in consulting costs, partially offset by an increase of 7 million in variable incentive plan cost. 
 Adjusted research and development expenses decreased by 11 million, or 12.0 , to 81 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2025, compared to 92 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2024. The decrease was primarily due to the same reasons described above on a U.S. GAAP basis. 
 Sales and Marketing Expenses 
 Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of marketing, advertising and promotion, salaries and benefits, information technology costs and travel expenses. 
 Sales and marketing expenses decreased by 9 million, or 11.7 , in the first nine months of fiscal 2025 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2024. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 8 million in salaries, and benefits and a decrease of 1 in variable incentive plan cost. 
 Adjusted sales and marketing expenses decreased by 9 million, or 12.0 , to 66 million in fiscal 2025 compared to 75 million in fiscal 2024. The decrease was primarily due to the same reasons described above on a U.S. GAAP basis. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administration expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits, external advisory fees, information technology costs, office and related staffing infrastructure costs. 
 General and administrative expenses decreased by 22 million, or 16.5 , in the first nine months of fiscal 2025 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2024. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 13 million in salaries and benefits expenses, a decrease of 11 million in legal expense, a decrease of 6 million in stock compensation costs, a decrease of 8 million in facilities cost, a decrease of 4 million in credit loss provision, and a decrease of 1 million in restructuring costs, partially offset by an increase of 17 million related to the release of an accrued liability relating to the Company s legacy mobile device business in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 which did not recur. 
 Adjusted general and administrative expenses decreased by 15 million, or 14.7 , to 87 million in fiscal 2025 compared to 102 million in fiscal 2024. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 13 million in salaries and benefits expenses, a decrease of 11 million in legal expense, a decrease of 8 million in facilities cost, and a decrease of 4 million in credit loss provision, partially offset by an increase of 17 million related to the release of an accrued liability relating to the Company s legacy mobile device business in the first nine months of fiscal 2024, which did not recur. 
 Amortization Expense 
 The table below presents a comparison of amortization expense relating to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets recorded as amortization or cost of sales for the nine months ended November 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended November 30, 2023. Intangible assets are comprised of patents, licenses and acquired technology. 
 61 

For the Nine Months Ended (in millions) Included in Operating Expense November 30, 2024 November 30, 2023 Change Property, plant and equipment 6 6 Intangible assets 8 16 (8) Total 14 22 (8) Included in Cost of Sales November 30, 2024 November 30, 2023 Change Property, plant and equipment 2 (2) Intangible assets 5 2 3 Total 5 4 1 
 Amortization included in Operating Expense 
 The decrease in amortization expense included in operating expense of 8 million was primarily due to the lower cost base of acquired technology assets. 
 Adjusted amortization expense decreased by 5 million to 8 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2025 compared to 13 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 due to the same reasons described above. 
 Amortization included in Cost of Sales 
 Amortization expense relating to certain property, plant and equipment and certain intangible assets employed in the Company s service operations increased by 1 million to 5 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2025 compared to 4 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 due to an increase in patent amortization expense included in cost of sales. 
 Investment Income, Net 
 Investment income, net, which includes the interest expense from the Debentures, was 8 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2025 and decreased by 7 million from 15 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 primarily due to a lower average cash and investment balance. 
 Income Taxes 
 For the first nine months of fiscal 2025, the Company s net effective income tax expense rate was approximately 29 (first nine months of fiscal 2024 - net effective income tax expense rate of approximately 37 ). The Company s net effective income tax rate reflects the change in unrecognized income tax benefits, if any, and the fact that the Company has a significant valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets, and in particular, the change in loss carry forwards, research and development credits, amongst other items, was offset by a corresponding adjustment of the valuation allowance. The Company s net effective income tax rate also reflects the geographic mix of earnings in jurisdictions with different income tax rates. 
 Net Income (loss) 
 The Company s net loss from continuing operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2025 was 1 million, or 0.00 basic and diluted loss per share on a U.S. GAAP basis (first nine months of fiscal 2024 - net income from continuing operations of 20 million, or 0.03 basic and diluted earnings per share). The decrease in net income of 21 million was primarily due to a decrease in revenue as described above in Revenue by Segment , partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses, as described above in Operating Expenses and an increase in gross margin percentage, as described above in Consolidated Gross Margin Percentage . 
 The Company s net loss from discontinued operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2025 was 71 million, or 0.12 basic and diluted loss per share on a U.S. GAAP basis (first nine months of fiscal 2024 - net loss from discontinued operations of 94 million, or 0.16 basic and diluted loss per share). The decrease in net loss of 21 million was primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses primarily due to a decrease in salaries and benefits expense, partially offset by a decrease in revenue. 
 Adjusted net loss was 5 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2025 or 0.01 adjusted basic loss per share (first nine months of fiscal 2024 - adjusted net income of 14 million, or 0.02 adjusted basic earnings per share). The decrease in adjusted net income of 19 million was primarily due to the same reasons described above on a U.S. GAAP basis. 
 62 

The weighted average number of shares outstanding was 591 million for basic and diluted loss per share for the first nine months of November 30, 2024. The weighted average number of shares outstanding was 584 million for basic and 590 million for diluted loss per share for the first nine months of November 30, 2023. 
 Common Shares Outstanding 
 On December 17, 2024, there were 592 million voting common shares, options to purchase 0.2 million voting common shares, 17 million restricted share units and 2 million deferred share units outstanding. In addition, 51.5 million common shares are issuable upon conversion in full of the Notes as described in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 The Company has not paid any cash dividends during the last three fiscal years. 
 
 Financial Condition 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Cash, cash equivalents, and investments decreased by 32 million to 266 million as at November 30, 2024 from 298 million as at February 29, 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital. 
 A comparative summary of cash, cash equivalents, and investments is set out below: 
 As at 
 (in millions) 
 November 30, 2024 February 29, 2024 Change Cash and cash equivalents 189 175 14 Restricted cash and cash equivalents 11 25 (14) Short-term investments 31 62 (31) Long-term investments 35 36 (1) Cash, cash equivalents, and investments 266 298 (32) 
 The table below summarizes the current assets, current liabilities, and working capital of the Company: 
 As at 
 (in millions) 
 November 30, 2024 February 29, 2024 Change Current assets 455 508 (53) Current liabilities 332 356 (24) Working capital 123 152 (29) 
 Current Assets 
 The decrease in current assets of 53 million at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2025 from the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in short term investments of 31 million, a decrease in accounts receivable, net of allowance of 18 million, and a decrease in other receivables of 13 million, partially offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents of 14 million, an increase in other current assets of 7 million and an increase in income taxes receivable of 1 million. 
 At November 30, 2024, accounts receivable, net of allowance was 161 million, a decrease of 18 million from February 29, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to lower revenue recognized over the three months ended November 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended February 29, 2024 and a decrease in days sales outstanding to 91 days at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2025 from 100 days at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 At November 30, 2024, other receivables were 6 million, a decrease of 13 million from February 29, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to the reclassification of 13 million in other receivables to long-term assets. 
 At November 30, 2024, other current assets were 39 million, an increase of 7 million from February 29, 2024. The increase was primarily due to an increase of 2 million in inventory and an increase of 1 million in prepaid software maintenance. 
 At November 30, 2024, income taxes receivables were 5 million, an increase of 1 million from February 29, 2024. The increase was primarily due to tax installments and prepayments required in certain taxable jurisdictions. 
 63 

Current Liabilities 
 The decrease in current liabilities of 24 million at the end of the third quarter of 2025 from the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in deferred revenue, current of 15 million, a decrease in accounts payable of 7 million, partially offset by an increase in income taxes payable of 5 million and a decrease in accrued liabilities of 3 million. 
 Deferred revenue, current was 133 million, which reflects a decrease of 15 million compared to February 29, 2024 that was attributable to a decrease of 8 million in deferred revenue, current related to BlackBerry UEM, a decrease in 4 million in deferred revenue, current related to BlackBerry QNX, and a decrease of 2 million in deferred revenue, current related to Secusmart. 
 Accounts payable were 9 million, reflecting a decrease of 7 million from February 29, 2024, which was primarily due to timing of payments. 
 Income taxes payable were 33 million, reflecting an increase of 5 million from February 29, 2024, which was primarily due to changes in the quarterly tax provision. 
 Accrued liabilities were 97 million at the end of the third quarter of 2025, reflecting a decrease of 3 million compared to February 29, 2024, which was primarily due to a decrease of 13 million in accrued restructuring costs and a decrease of 3 million in operating lease liability, current, partially offset by an increase of 10 million in variable incentive plan accrual and an increase of 2 million in vacation accrual. 
 Cash flows for the nine months ended November 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended November 30, 2023 were as follows: 
 For the Nine Months Ended (in millions) November 30, 2024 November 30, 2023 Change Net cash flows provided by (used in): Operating activities (25) 12 (37) Investing activities 22 112 (90) Financing activities 3 (211) 214 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (87) 87 
 Operating Activities 
 The increase in net cash flows used in operating activities of 37 million was primarily a result of the Company s patent sale in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, which was a one-time event, and changes in working capital. 
 Investing Activities 
 During the nine months ended November 30, 2024, cash flows provided by investing activities were 22 million and included cash provided by transactions involving the acquisitions of short-term and long-term investments, net of the proceeds on sale or maturity in the amount of 31 million, offset by cash used in the acquisition of intangible assets of 6 million, and the acquisition of property, plant and equipment of 3 million. For the same period in the prior fiscal year, cash flows provided by investing activities were 112 million and included cash used in transactions involving the acquisitions of short-term and long-term investments, net of the proceeds on sale or maturity in the amount of 129 million, offset by cash used in the acquisition of intangible assets of 12 million, and the acquisition of property, plant and equipment of 5 million. 
 Financing Activities 
 The increase in cash flows provided by financing activities was 214 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2025 primarily due the net effect of redemption of the 2020 Debentures and the issuance of the Extension Debentures, as defined below, which did not recur. 
 Debt Financing and Other Funding Sources 
 See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company s 200 million aggregate principal amount of 3.00 senior convertible unsecured notes issued in January 2024 (the Notes ), the 365 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures issued in September 2020, which matured in November 2023 (the 2020 Debentures ), and the 150 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures issued in November 2023, which matured in February 
 64 

2024 (the Extension Debentures and, collectively with the Notes and the 2020 Debentures, the Debentures and the 2020 Debentures and, collectively with the Extension Debentures, the Prior Debentures ). 
 The Company has 11 million in collateralized outstanding letters of credit in support of certain leasing arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of business. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information concerning the Company s restricted cash. 
 Cash, cash equivalents, and investments were approximately 266 million as at November 30, 2024. The Company s management remains focused on maintaining appropriate cash balances, efficiently managing working capital balances and managing the liquidity needs of the business. Based on its current financial projections, the Company believes its financial resources, together with expected future operating cash generating and operating expense reduction activities, should be sufficient to meet funding requirements for current financial commitments and future operating expenditures not yet committed, and should provide the necessary financial capacity for the foreseeable future. 
 Contractual and Other Obligations 
 The following table sets out aggregate information about the Company s contractual and other obligations and the periods in which payments are due as at November 30, 2024: 
 (in millions) Total Short-term (next 12 months) Long-term (>12 months) Operating lease obligations 57 20 37 Purchase obligations and commitments 56 56 Debt interest and principal payments 227 6 221 Total 340 82 258 
 Total contractual and other obligations as at November 30, 2024 decreased by approximately 4 million as compared to the February 29, 2024 balance of approximately 344 million, which was attributable to a decrease in operating lease obligations, partially offset by an increase in purchase obligations and commitments. 
 The Company does not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 
 Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates 
 There have been no changes to the Company s accounting policies or critical accounting estimates from those described under Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates in the Annual MD A, other than as described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 The Company is engaged in operating and financing activities that generate risk in three primary areas: 
 Foreign Exchange 
 The Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk as a result of transactions in currencies other than its functional currency, the U.S. dollar. The majority of the Company s revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 was transacted in U.S. dollars. Portions of the revenue were denominated in Canadian dollars, euros and British pounds. Expenses, consisting mainly of salaries and certain other operating costs, were incurred primarily in Canadian dollars, but were also incurred in U.S. dollars, euros and British pounds. At November 30, 2024, approximately 23 of cash and cash equivalents, 24 of accounts receivables and 88 of accounts payable were denominated in foreign currencies (February 29, 2024 19 , 25 and 59 , respectively). These foreign currencies primarily include the Canadian dollar, euro and British pound. As part of its risk management strategy, the Company maintains net monetary asset and/or liability balances in foreign currencies and engages in foreign currency hedging activities using derivative financial instruments, including currency forward contracts and currency options. The Company does not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes. If overall foreign currency exchange rates to the U.S. dollar uniformly weakened or strengthened by 10 related to the Company s net monetary asset or liability balances in foreign currencies at November 30, 2024 (after hedging activities), the impact to the Company would be immaterial. 
 The Company regularly reviews its currency forward and option positions, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency exposures. Given the effective horizons of the Company s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in currency exchange rates. Further, the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company s financial condition and operating results. 
 65 

Interest Rate 
 Cash and cash equivalents and investments are invested in certain instruments with fixed interest rates of varying maturities. Consequently, the Company is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of holding investments of varying maturities and the significant financing components within certain revenue contracts with customers. The fair value of investments, as well as the investment income derived from the investment portfolio, will fluctuate with changes in prevailing interest rates. The Company also has significant financing components within certain revenue contracts with customers and is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of discounting the future payments from customers with a fixed interest rate. The Company has also issued Notes with a fixed interest rate, as described in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of the Notes. The Company does not currently utilize interest rate derivative instruments. 
 Credit and Customer Concentration 
 The Company, in the normal course of business, monitors the financial condition of its customers and reviews the credit history of each new customer. The Company establishes an allowance for credit losses ACL that corresponds to the specific credit risk of its customers, historical trends and economic circumstances. The ACL as at November 30, 2024 was 6 million (February 29, 2024 - 6 million). There were two customers that comprised more than 10 of accounts receivable as at November 30, 2024 (February 29, 2024 - two customers that comprised more than 10 ). During the third quarter of fiscal 2025, the percentage of the Company s receivable balance that was past due decreased by 13.8 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Although the Company actively monitors and attempts to collect on its receivables as they become due, the risk of further delays or challenges in obtaining timely payments of receivables from resellers and other distribution partners exists. The occurrence of such delays or challenges in obtaining timely payments could negatively impact the Company s liquidity and financial condition. There was one customer that comprised 18 of the Company s revenue and 15 of the Company s revenue in the three and nine months ended November 30, 2024, respectively (three and nine months ended November 30, 2023 - two customers that comprised 29 of the Company s revenue and one customer that comprised 37 of the Company s revenue, respectively, due to the completed patent sale transaction). 
 Market values are determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. The Company assesses declines in the value of individual investments for impairment to determine whether the decline is other-than-temporary. The Company makes this assessment by considering available evidence including changes in general market conditions, specific industry and individual company data, the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition, the near-term prospects of the individual investment and the Company s ability and intent to hold the debt securities to maturity. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 As of November 30, 2024, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of such date, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to give reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 During the three months ended November 30, 2024, no changes were made to the Company s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding certain legal proceedings in which the Company is involved. 
 
 ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION 
 Rule 10b5-1 and Non-Rule 10b5-1 Trading Arrangements 
 During the three months ended November 30, 2024, neither the Company or any of its officers or directors adopted or terminated trading arrangements for the sale of the Company s common shares.

It is the intention of the parties that if any of the restrictions or covenants contained in this Section 6.7 is held to cover a geographic area or to be for a length of time that is not permitted by Law, or is in any way construed to be too broad or to any extent invalid, such provision shall not be construed to be null, void and of no effect, but to the extent such provision would then be valid or enforceable under Law, such provision shall be construed and interpreted or reformed to provide for a restriction or covenant having the maximum enforceable geographic area, time period and other provisions as shall be valid and enforceable under Law. 6.8 Release. (a) Seller does hereby, on behalf of itself and each of its Affiliates, successors and assigns and any other Person claiming by, through or under any of the foregoing (the Seller Releasing Parties (and on behalf of each of them Seller does hereby), effective as of, and contingent upon, the Closing, unconditionally and irrevocably release, waive and forever discharge Purchaser and each of its Affiliates (including the Transferred Subsidiary) and each of their predecessors and successors and each of their respective past, present and future directors, officers, employees, agents, assigns, equityholders, partners, insurers, Subsidiaries and Affiliates (collectively, the Purchaser Released Parties from any and all claims, demands, judgments, causes of action and Liabilities of any nature whatsoever, whether or not known, suspected or claimed, to the extent related to the Business, the Transferred Assets, the Excluded Liabilities or the Transferred Subsidiary, in each case arising prior to the Closing other than (i) Assumed Liabilities, (ii) any claims arising from rights of such Seller Releasing Party arising under this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement or the Transactions or (iii) any claims that cannot be released as a matter of applicable Law (a Purchaser Released Claim ).

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 6.8 to the contrary, the Seller Releasing Parties are not releasing any obligations of Purchaser and its Affiliates under this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement. (b) WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, SELLER (ON ITS OWN BEHALF AND ON BEHALF OF THE SELLER RELEASING PARTIES) EXPRESSLY WAIVES AND RELINQUISHES ALL RIGHTS AND BENEFITS AFFORDED BY ANY APPLICABLE STATUTE IN THE CONTEXT OF A GENERAL RELEASE, INCLUDING CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542 (OR SIMILAR PROVISION IN THE JURISDICTION IN WHICH SUCH PERSON RESIDES), WHICH STATUTE GENERALLY PROVIDES FOR THE FOLLOWING: A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS THAT THE CREDITOR OR RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE AND THAT, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, WOULD HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY. SELLER (ON ITS OWN BEHALF AND ON BEHALF OF THE SELLER RELEASING PARTIES) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT MAY HEREAFTER DISCOVER FACTS DIFFERENT FROM OR IN ADDITION TO THOSE NOW KNOWN OR BELIEVED TO BE TRUE WITH RESPECT TO 

48 SUCH PURCHASER RELEASED CLAIMS AND AGREES THAT THE ABOVE RELEASE WILL REMAIN EFFECTIVE IN ALL RESPECTS NOTWITHSTANDING ANY SUCH DIFFERENCES OR ADDITIONAL FACTS. SELLER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS CAREFULLY READ THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND GENERAL RELEASE AND UNDERSTANDS ITS CONTENTS. 6.9 Tax Matters. (a) Tax Returns and Seller Tax Contests. (i) Seller shall timely prepare and file (or cause to be timely prepared and filed) with the appropriate Tax Authorities all Tax Returns required to be filed by or with respect to the Selling Entities (insofar as it relates to any of the Business, Transferred Assets, or Transferred Subsidiary, and in respect of a Transferred Asset only if a failure under this Section 6.9(a)(i) would create a lien on the Transferred Asset in favor of a Tax Authority under applicable Law), the Transferred Subsidiary, the Business or the Transferred Assets on or before the Closing Date, and shall pay (or cause to be paid) all Taxes required to be paid on or before the Closing Date by or with respect to the Selling Entities (insofar as it relates to any of the Business, Transferred Assets, or Transferred Subsidiary), of the Transferred Subsidiary, the Business or the Transferred Assets. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared by treating items on such Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the past practices of the Transferred Subsidiary, Seller or the Selling Entities, as applicable, with respect to such items, except as otherwise required by applicable Law. At least twenty (20) days prior to filing any such Tax Return (or such shorter period of time as is reasonable taking into account the timing of Closing and the nature of the applicable Tax Return), Seller shall submit a copy of such Tax Return to Purchaser for Purchaser s review and comment, and shall consider in good faith any reasonable comments of Purchaser prior to filing such Tax Return. (ii) Purchaser shall timely prepare and file (or cause to be timely prepared and filed) with the appropriate Tax Authorities all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Transferred Subsidiary following the Closing) with respect to the Transferred Subsidiary after the Closing Date that relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period. To the extent any such Tax Returns show an amount of Taxes that could reasonably result in indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2 of this Agreement, Purchaser shall provide a copy of relevant portions of such Tax Return to Seller for its review and comment at least twenty (20) days prior to filing any such Tax Return (or such shorter period of time as is reasonable taking into account the nature of the applicable Tax Return), and shall consider in good faith any reasonable comments of Seller prior to filing such Tax Return. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall require Purchaser to provide its consolidated income Tax Returns to Seller. (b) Straddle Periods. For purposes of determining whether any Tax incurred with respect to a Straddle Period is an Indemnified Tax or otherwise allocated to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, Taxes incurred with respect to a Straddle Period (other than Transfer Taxes, the allocation of which shall be governed by Section 2.3) shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date as follows: (i) in the case of Taxes that are based upon or related to income, sales, proceeds, profits, receipts, wages, compensation, or similar items and all other Taxes that are not imposed on a periodic basis, the amount of such Taxes which would be payable if the taxable period of the Transferred Subsidiary, Transferred Assets or the Business ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date based on an interim closing of the books (except that (A) solely for purposes of determining the marginal Tax rate applicable to income or receipts during such period in a jurisdiction in which such Tax rate depends upon the amount or level of income or receipts, annualized income or receipts may be taken into account if appropriate for an equitable sharing of such Taxes, (B) exemptions, allowances and deductions that are otherwise calculated 

49 on an annual basis (including depreciation and amortization deductions, other than with respect to property placed in service after the Closing) shall be apportioned on a daily basis and (C) in the case of any Taxes attributable to the ownership of any equity interest in any partnership or other flowthrough entity, as if the taxable period of such partnership or other flowthrough entity ended as of the end of the Closing Date); and (ii) in the case of Taxes not described in clause (i) and that are imposed on a periodic basis, the amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period), multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire period. No later than five (5) days before the due date of any Tax Return related to the Business or the Transferred Assets for any Straddle Period, Seller shall pay to Purchaser the amount of any Taxes due on such Tax Return for which Seller is responsible, but only to the extent such amount has not been accrued for in Indebtedness and taken into account as a reduction to the Closing Cash Payment in the Final Closing Statement. (c) Cooperation. Purchaser and Seller agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance relating to the Business, the Transferred Subsidiary or the Transferred Assets, including, without limitation, access to such books and records, as is reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns by Purchaser or Seller or any of their respective Affiliates, the making of any election relating to Taxes, the preparation for any audit with respect to Taxes, and the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax; provided that neither Purchaser nor Seller nor either of their respective Affiliates shall be obligated to provide any Tax Return or portion thereof (or related books, records or workpapers) that does not relate directly to the Business, the Transferred Subsidiary or the Transferred Assets, as applicable, for a Pre- Closing Tax Period. Each of Purchaser and Seller shall retain all books and records with respect to Taxes pertaining to the Business, the Transferred Subsidiary or the Transferred Assets until the expiration of the statute of limitations period (including, to the extent notified by Purchaser or Seller, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Entity. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller has no right to review or access Purchaser s (or its Affiliates Tax Returns or to participate in any Proceeding (including a Tax Contest) relating to Purchaser s (or its Affiliates Taxes. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the Transferred Subsidiary shall constitute an Affiliate of Purchaser for all taxable periods (or portions thereof) beginning after the Closing Date. (d) Tax Contests. Without the prior written consent of Seller (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Purchaser will not settle, compromise or abandon any Tax Contest with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Business, the Transferred Subsidiary or the Transferred Assets for which Seller may have an indemnification obligation pursuant to this Agreement (a Seller Tax Contest ). Purchaser shall provide Seller with notice of any Seller Tax Contests within a reasonable period after receipt of notice of such Tax Contest, and Purchaser shall keep Seller reasonably informed of the status of such Seller Tax Contest. The failure to so notify Seller shall not relieve Seller of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall have materially and adversely prejudiced Seller. The provisions of this Section 6.9(d) shall govern any Tax Contest related to any Pre-Closing Tax Period. (e) Post-Closing Actions. With respect to the Transferred Subsidiary, the Business or the Transferred Assets, Purchaser and its Affiliates will not, without the prior written consent of Seller (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed): (i) amend any Tax Return of the Transferred Subsidiary relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii) consent to the waiver or extension of the statute of limitations relating to Taxes of the Business, the Transferred Subsidiary or the Transferred Assets with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (iii) apply to any Governmental Entity for any binding or non-binding opinion, ruling or other determination or make any voluntary disclosure to a Tax Authority, 

50 in each case, with respect any act, matter or transaction that occurred on or before the Closing Date or that relates to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, in each case, for the Business, the Transferred Assets or the Transferred Subsidiary or (iv) make or change any Tax election with respect to the Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Transferred Subsidiary (other than a Section 338(g) Election), in each case for clauses (i)-(iv) that could reasonably be expected to result in a Seller indemnification obligation pursuant to this Agreement. (f) Allocation. The Purchase Price (and any other amounts treated as consideration for U.S. federal (and applicable state, local and non-U.S.) Tax purposes) shall be allocated among (i) the Transferred Subsidiary Equity Interests and (ii) the Transferred Assets and Assumed Liabilities of the Business, in each case, in a manner substantially consistent with the allocation methodology set forth in Schedule 6.9(f), except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Law, and which shall be consistent with the principles of Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (the Allocation ). Prior to the Closing Date, Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith to mutually agree on an estimated Allocation which shall be substantially consistent with the allocation methodology set forth in Schedule 6.9(f), except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Law; provided that if Seller and Purchaser do not agree to an estimated Allocation as of the Closing Date, the Purchasing Entities shall be permitted to file any Tax Return or other document in accordance with Purchaser s estimated Allocation. Within thirty (30) days following the Determination Date, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a proposed final Allocation (the date of such delivery, the Allocation Delivery Date and the Seller and Purchaser will cooperate in good faith to mutually agree on a final Allocation. If Purchaser and Seller cannot agree to a final Allocation within thirty (30) days of the Allocation Delivery Date, the final Allocation (including any disputed items of valuations) shall be determined by the Independent Accountant pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 2.2(c)(iii). The final Allocation as determined between Parent and Seller, or by the Independent Accountant, as applicable, shall be referred to as the Final Allocation. The parties agree to file all U.S. and non-U.S. federal, state and local income Tax Returns and other filings in accordance with the Final Allocation, and none of the parties shall take any Tax position that is inconsistent with such Final Allocation (other than the Purchasing Entities prior to the date on which the Final Allocation is determined), unless required to do so by applicable Law. If there is any adjustment to the Purchase Price (as determined for U.S. federal and applicable state, local and non- U.S. Tax purposes), the parties shall modify the Final Allocation accordingly consistent with the principles set forth in the Final Allocation. (g) Section 338(g) Election and Section 338(g) Election Allocation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement. the Purchasing Entities shall be permitted to make an election under Section 338(g) of the Code (a Section 338(g) Election with respect to the Transferred Subsidiary. If any Purchasing Entity elects to make a Section 338(g) Election, such Purchasing Entity shall prepare an allocation of the portion of the Purchase Price (and any other amounts treated as consideration for U.S. federal (and applicable state, local and non-U.S.) Tax purposes) allocable to the assets deemed sold for U.S. federal income Tax purposes as a result of such election (the Section 338 Allocation ), which shall be consistent with the Final Allocation (or, if not yet determined, the Allocation) and provide a copy of such Section 338 Allocation to Seller and shall consider in good faith any reasonable comments timely proposed by Seller (such final allocation determined by such Purchasing Entity, the Final Section 338 Allocation ). The parties agree to file all federal, state and local income Tax Returns and other filings, in all respects and for all purposes in accordance with any Final Section 338 Allocations, and none of the parties shall take any Tax position (whether in Tax Returns, before any Governmental Entity charged with the collection of any income Tax, or in any judicial proceeding) that is inconsistent with such Final Section 338 Allocation unless required to do so by applicable Law. If there is any adjustment to the Purchase Price, the parties shall modify any Final Section 338 Allocations accordingly. (h) Cylance Inc. Liquidation. Neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates, including Cylance Inc., shall liquidate Cylance Inc. (as defined for U.S. federal income tax purposes, 

51 including for purposes of Section 331 and Section 332 of the Code and including any deemed liquidation) prior to the determination of the Final Allocation. If, following the determination of the Final Allocation, Purchaser reasonably determines that a liquidation of Cylance Inc. may result in Purchaser s acquisition of assets from Cylance Inc. to be treated as a tax-deferred reorganization pursuant to Section 368 of the Code, Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller and neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates, including Cylance Inc., shall liquidate Cylance Inc. (as defined for U.S. federal income tax purposes, including for purposes of Section 331 and Section 332 of the Code and including any deemed liquidation) prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date. (i) Certain Tax Treatment. The parties further agree that none of the Purchasing Entities, Selling Entities nor any of their respective Affiliates, shall report on any Tax Return a deemed payment to a Purchasing Entity by a Selling Entity in exchange for a Purchasing Entity assuming any liabilities under James M. Pierce Corp. v. Comm., 326 F.2d 67 (8th Cir. 1964) (such deemed payment provided for under such case, the Pierce Method ), IRS Revenue Ruling 68-112, 1968-1 CB 62, or any similar authority, in each case, with respect to any prepaid amount or deferred revenue received by the Selling Entities prior to the Closing; provided, however, that if, prior to the Closing and after consultation with a nationally recognized accounting firm, Seller reasonably determines in good faith that, solely as a result of such reporting position required by this sentence, the Selling Entities have a material state cash tax liability that such Selling Entities would not have if the parties applied the Pierce Method, Seller will provide Purchaser with access to the advice and analysis supporting that conclusion and the parties will consider in good faith utilizing an alternative methodology for reporting such prepaid amount or deferred revenue for U.S. federal and applicable state and local income tax purposes, taking into account the relative tax impact (including any cash tax burdens and reduction in tax attributes, including net operating losses) of such methodology on the Purchasing Entities and Selling Entities. 6.10 Procedure for Certain Assets Not Transferable. (a) If any Transferred Asset is not assignable or transferable at the Closing, including because of the inability to obtain the Consent of any third party (including a Governmental Entity) prior to the Closing (each such asset, a Non-Assignable Asset ), this Agreement and the related instruments of transfer shall not constitute an assignment or transfer thereof and Purchaser shall not assume any Selling Entity s Liabilities with respect thereto. (b) Following the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain promptly, or cause to be obtained promptly, any Consent (other than any Consent under any Antitrust Laws or other similar Laws, which shall be governed by Section 6.13) required to assign or transfer any of the Non-Assignable Assets to Purchaser. If any such Consent is not obtained prior to the Closing, the Closing shall nonetheless take place subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 7, and until such time as such Consent(s) are obtained, Seller will cooperate with Purchaser to implement any arrangement reasonably acceptable to Seller and Purchaser intended to place Purchaser in the substantially identical economic position (including with respect to rights, benefits, and obligations associated with such Non-Assignable Asset) that it would have been in if such Non-Assignable Assets had been transferred to Purchaser (or another Purchasing Entity) at Closing including by providing Purchaser (or another Purchasing Entity), to the fullest extent practicable. Seller shall be responsible for any cost of obtaining Consents for Non-Assignable Assets hereunder payable to counterparties to such Non-Assignable Assets. (c) Without limiting the foregoing, until Consent to assignment of each Non- Assignable Assets is obtained, (i) Purchaser (or another Purchasing Entity) shall be considered Seller s (or such Other Selling Entities agent for purposes of (A) collecting all amounts that may be due from the third party or third parties with respect to the Non-Assignable Assets; and (B) negotiating or otherwise handling 

52 all disputes and issues that may arise in connection with the Non-Assignable Assets; (ii) Purchaser (or another Purchasing Entity) shall be entitled to retain all payments due from the third party or third parties under the Non-Assignable Assets; and (iii) Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, pay and remit to Purchaser (or another Purchasing Entity designated by Purchaser) all payments received in respect of the Non-Assignable Assets as promptly as reasonably practicable following receipt thereof, net of any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Seller (or any Other Selling Entity) in connection with the maintenance of such Non-Assignable Asset for Purchaser s benefit pursuant to this Section 6.10. Without prior written Consent of the other party, neither Seller (or any Other Selling Entities) nor Purchaser (or another Purchasing Entity) shall agree to any amendment, modification, extension, renewal, termination or other change in the terms of any Non-Assignable Assets, and Seller shall maintain for the use of Purchaser (or another Purchasing Entity) all benefits of such Non-Assignable Assets. 6.11 Shared Accounts Receivable. The parties recognize that the proceeds of certain Transferred Receivables may be paid to Seller or an Affiliate thereof following the Closing. Seller agrees to cooperate with Purchaser and to cause Seller s Affiliates to cooperate in identifying and promptly reporting to Purchaser each such occurrence for a period of eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date and to take such actions as are necessary to ensure that the benefits of Transferred Receivables are received by Purchaser or an Affiliate thereof. 6.12 Wrong Pockets. (a) From and after the Closing, if any asset held by Purchaser or its Affiliates is determined to be an Excluded Asset or Purchaser or any of its Affiliates is subject to an Excluded Liability, then, at Seller s expense, (i) Purchaser or its applicable Affiliate shall promptly return and/or transfer and convey (without further consideration payable to the Selling Entities) to Seller or the applicable Affiliate of Seller such Excluded Asset or Excluded Liability, (ii) Seller or its applicable Affiliate shall assume (without further consideration payable to the Selling Entities) such Excluded Liability and (iii) Seller and Purchaser shall, and shall cause their applicable Affiliates to, execute such documents or instruments of conveyance or assumption and take such further acts as are reasonably necessary or desirable to effect the transfer of such Excluded Asset or Excluded Liability back to Seller or its applicable Affiliate. (b) From and after the Closing, if any asset held by Seller or any of its Affiliates is determined to be a Transferred Asset or Seller or any of its Affiliates is subject to an Assumed Liability, then, at Seller s expense, (i) Seller or its applicable Affiliate shall promptly return and/or transfer and convey (without further consideration payable to the Selling Entities) to Purchaser or the applicable Affiliate of Purchaser such Transferred Asset or Assumed Liability, (ii) Purchaser or its applicable Affiliate shall assume such Assumed Liability and (iii) Seller and Purchaser shall, and shall cause their applicable Affiliates to, execute such documents or instruments of conveyance or assumption and take such further acts as are reasonably necessary or desirable to effect the transfer of such Transferred Asset or Assumed Liability back to Purchaser or its applicable Affiliate. 6.13 Necessary Efforts; No Inconsistent Action. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Purchaser and Seller will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to consummate the Transactions as soon as practicable after the date hereof. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party agrees to make the filings under Antitrust Law that are required to consummate the Transactions as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable and advisable to requests from any Governmental Entity for additional information pursuant to Antitrust Law, and to cooperate with the other party by promptly notifying the other, and, if in writing, furnishing the other with copies of, any communication it receives from any Governmental Entity.

53 in this Article 6, Purchaser shall not be obligated to initiate, join, defend, take any action, or otherwise participate in any Proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, in order to (a) oppose or defend against any action by any Governmental Entity to prevent or enjoin the consummation of any of the Transactions, or (b) overturn any regulatory action by any Governmental Entity to prohibit consummation of any of the Transactions, including defending any suit, action or other Proceeding brought by any Governmental Entity seeking the entry or affirmation of any injunction, order or decree that would prevent Closing. 6.14 Further Assurances. From time to time, at the Purchasing Entities request, whether on or after the Closing Date and without further consideration, the Selling Entities shall execute and deliver or cause to be executed and delivered by their Affiliates such further instruments of conveyance and transfer and take such other action as the Purchasing Entities reasonably may require to (a) effectively convey, transfer and assign to the Purchasing Entities title to the Transferred Subsidiary Equity Interests or the Transferred Assets, (b) effectively convey, transfer and assign to the Selling Entities or their Affiliates title to any Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities or (c) effectuate the Transactions. 6.15 Intercompany Liabilities. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall, after consultation with Purchaser, cause to be settled, canceled or otherwise discharged all intercompany payables and receivables between the Transferred Subsidiary, on the one hand, and Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Subsidiary), on the other hand, such that no further amounts are owed by the Transferred Subsidiary to Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Subsidiary) as of the Closing, without any further or continuing Liability of the Transferred Subsidiary or with respect to the Business. 6.16 Bulk Sales. The parties waive compliance with any applicable bulk sale or bulk transfer notification requirements in connection with the sale of Transferred Assets to Purchaser or any Purchasing Entity; provided that any Taxes resulting from the failure to comply with any bulk sale or bulk transfer Laws in connection with the sale of Transferred Assets to Purchaser or any Purchasing Entity shall be Indemnified Taxes. 6.17 Closing Deliverables. Seller shall cause all of the Closing deliverables required to be delivered by it pursuant to Section 7.2(e) to be delivered to Purchaser at or prior to the Closing. Purchaser shall cause all of the closing deliverables required to be delivered by it pursuant to Section 7.1(d) to be delivered to Seller at or prior to the Closing. 6.18 Audit Support. (a) For a period of six (6) months following the Closing, at Purchaser s sole cost and expense, Seller and its Affiliates agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to Purchaser, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance relating to the Business, the Transferred Subsidiary or the Transferred Assets, including, without limitation, access to such books and records, as is reasonably necessary for the preparation by Purchaser of audited financial statements related to the Business, the Transferred Assets and the Transferred Subsidiary. (b) Within forty-five (45) days following Closing, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser (i) a stand-alone carve-out balance sheet of the Closing and (ii) a stand-alone carve-out balance sheet of the Transferred Subsidiary as of the Closing (together, the Closing Date Balance Sheet ). 6.19 Transferred Property Guarantee. As promptly as practicable following the Closing, Purchaser or another Purchasing Entities, as applicable, shall use reasonable best efforts to substitute itself or any of its Affiliates in all respects for Seller and its Affiliates (and cause Seller and its Affiliates to be released in respect of) all obligations of Seller and its Affiliates as guarantor of any Transferred Lease Agreement, in each case pursuant to the terms of the applicable Transferred Lease Agreement. Seller and 

54 the Other Selling Entities, as applicable, shall cooperate with Purchaser and such other Purchasing Entities, as applicable, with respect to any information or documentation reasonably requested by the landlord of each Transferred Property to facilitate such substitution and release in respect of such guaranties. 6.20 Professional Services Report.

Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the nature and amount, if known, or the method of computation of the amount of such claim, if known, of such Third Party Claim and the basis for indemnification (taking into account the information then available to the Indemnified Party). The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall have materially and adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying Party. An 

62 Indemnified Party may update a Notice of Indemnification Claim from time to time to reflect any change in circumstances following the date thereof. (b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party not later than twenty (20) Business Days after the Indemnifying Party s receipt of the Notice of Indemnification Claim in respect of the Third Party Claim, to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim (except that Seller shall not be permitted to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim that (i) involves any claim for non-monetary relief or criminal liability that would, in each case, only apply to the Indemnified Party, (ii) involves a Key Customer or Key Supplier, (iii) alleges an aggregate amount of Losses that is more than the then-remaining amount available under the Delayed Cash Amount or (iv) involved a Proceeding of Purchaser (or any Affiliate of Purchaser) with respect to Taxes, which shall be governed solely by Section 6.9(d)) at the Indemnifying Party s expense and by the Indemnifying Party s own counsel, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith in such defense; provided that the Indemnifying Party shall not admit liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge a Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned unless such admission of liability, settlement, compromise or discharge involves any non-monetary relief or finding or admission of any violation of Law or admission of any wrongdoing by any Indemnified Party). In the event and for so long as the Indemnifying Party is contesting or defending any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (and its and their officers and employees) to, at the sole expense of the Indemnifying Party, cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in such contest or defense, including making available its personnel, and provide such testimony and access to its books and records, in each case to the extent relating to the Business, the Transferred Subsidiary, the Transferred Assets or the Assumed Liabilities, as shall be reasonably necessary in connection with such prosecution, contest or defense. (c) For any Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party has elected to assume the defense of in accordance with Section 8.4(b) above, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim at its own expense with counsel selected by it.

(d) Each party shall cooperate, and cause its Affiliates to cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim and shall furnish or cause to be furnished such records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith; provided that in no event shall any party be required to provide or make available any documents or other information covered by attorney-client privilege, the attorney work-product doctrine or any other evidentiary privileges. (e) In the event an Indemnified Party has a claim for indemnification under Article 8 against an Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party agrees to provide a Notice of Indemnification Claim to such Indemnifying Party reasonably promptly, but 

63 in any event within thirty (30) days of the occurrence of the event or circumstance giving rise to the claim. Such Notice of Indemnification Claim shall set forth in reasonable detail the nature and amount, if known, or the method of computation of the amount of such claim, if known, of such claim and the basis for indemnification (taking into account the information then available to the Indemnified Party). The failure to so provide such a Notice of Indemnification Claim to the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall have materially and adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying Party. An Indemnified Party may update a Notice of Indemnification Claim from time to time to reflect any change in circumstances following the date thereof. If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party in writing within thirty (30) days following the receipt of a Notice of Indemnification Claim that the Indemnifying Party disputes its indemnification obligation to the Indemnified Party for any Losses with respect to such claim, such Losses shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party, but subject to Section 8.3. If the Indemnifying Party has timely disputed its indemnity obligation for any Losses with respect to such claim, the parties shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved through negotiations after thirty (30) days or such other amount of time as the parties mutually agree, such dispute shall be resolved in accordance with Section 10.3. (f) In the event it is determined pursuant to this Article 8 that a Purchaser Indemnified Party is entitled indemnification for any Losses Determined Purchaser Losses ), then, subject to the limitation set forth in this Article 8, the Delayed Cash Amount shall be reduced by an amount equal to the applicable Determined Purchaser Losses. Only if the then-remaining Delayed Cash Amount, if any, is insufficient to satisfy in whole the applicable Determined Purchaser Losses, then, subject to the limitations set forth in this Article 8 and except as may be provided in Section 8.6, Seller shall pay such shortfall to the applicable Purchaser Indemnified Party in cash, via wire transfer instructions specified by Purchaser, within ten (10) Business Days following the date of such determination. (g) In the event it is determined pursuant to this Article 8 that a Seller Indemnified Party is entitled indemnification for any Losses Determined Seller Losses ), then Purchaser shall pay the applicable Determined Seller Losses to the applicable Seller Indemnified Party in cash, via wire transfer instructions specified by Seller, within ten (10) Business Days following the date of such determination; provided that if Seller does not pay the amount of the Determined Seller Losses as required by this Section 8.4(g), Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, unilaterally elect to cancel a portion of the Stock Consideration equal to the Determined Seller Losses and shall take all steps necessary to cancel such shares of Stock Consideration, with each such share of Stock Consideration valued at [Redacted: Private company valuation of Deemed Issue Price redacted to avoid investor confusion. Fair value will be in Seller s financial statements.] per share. 8.5 Determination of Losses. All indemnification payments under this Article 8 shall be deemed adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Law. For purposes of calculating the amount of Losses incurred arising out of or relating to any breach or inaccuracy of a representation or warranty or covenant and for purposes of determining whether or not a breach has occurred, the references to Material Adverse Effect or other materiality qualifications (or similar or correlative terms) contained in or otherwise applicable to such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, including as expressed in accounting concepts, shall be disregarded. For the avoidance of doubt, any Losses for indemnification under this Agreement shall be determined without duplication of recovery due to the facts giving rise to such Losses constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. 8.6 Set-Off. To the extent that a Purchaser Indemnified Party has made a claim for indemnification determined to be the responsibility of Seller pursuant to Section 8.4, it is expressly agreed by the parties hereto that Seller may elect to satisfy the aggregate amount of all such Losses in excess of 

64 the Cash Consideration by means of the return of the Stock Consideration to Purchaser at the Deemed Per Share Purchase Price with respect to such claim for indemnification. Seller shall provide a notice to Purchaser detailing the shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be transferred to Purchaser or cancelled to satisfy all or a portion of such Losses and shall provide Purchaser with any other paperwork reasonably required by Purchaser to effect such cancellation or transfer to Purchaser on its books and records. Any portion of the Stock Consideration set-off by Purchaser in connection with a claim for indemnification determined to be the responsibility of Seller pursuant to Section 8.4 shall be permanently forfeited by Seller. Neither the exercise of nor the failure to exercise such right of set-off will constitute an election of remedies or limit the Purchaser Indemnified Parties in any manner in the enforcement of any other remedies that may be available to them. 8.7 No Contribution. Seller shall not have any right to seek indemnification, reimbursement or contribution from the Transferred Subsidiary with respect to all or any part of any matter including the indemnification obligations under this Article 8. 8.8 Claims Not Affected by Knowledge. No Purchaser Indemnified Party s right to indemnification, reimbursement or other remedy based upon a breach of or inaccuracy in any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation hereunder shall be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) by Purchaser or Purchaser s Representatives, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with any such representation, warranty, covenant or obligation. 8.9 Exclusive Remedy. Except with respect to (a) claims for Losses involving, arising out of or resulting from Fraud, (b) claims arising out of the Transaction Agreements other than this Agreement and (c) claims for specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable relief pursuant to Section 10.8, from and after the Closing, claims for indemnification pursuant this Article 8 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any claims or causes of action for money damages arising out of, based upon or resulting from any inaccuracy or breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or other obligation contained in this Agreement. 8.10 No Double Recovery. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if an Indemnified Party is entitled to a payment or other benefit under more than one provision of this Agreement (including, without limitation, pursuant to the indemnification provisions pursuant to this Article 8 or as an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Article 2) arising out of or resulting from the same set of facts or circumstances and the Indemnified Party has already received payment or otherwise received a benefit under this Agreement, in no event shall such Indemnified Party be entitled to receive a subsequent payment or benefit under any other provision of this Agreement in duplication of such prior payment or benefit. 9.

Sections 6.3 and 10 shall remain in full force and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement.

The customer cannot cover some software licenses, subscriptions and value added services on support and go unsupported on others. Cover all software and licenses, subscriptions and value- added services consistently on the same level of support. For example, if a customer purchases Premium support for some software it must cover all software, subscriptions and value- added services at the Premium level. Customers must renew their technical support subscription on time to ensure there is no lapse in coverage. Should a lapse occur and the customer wishes to renew the coverage, except as otherwise stated herein, the new technical support subscription effective date will be the day following the original expiration date. With regard to technical support services for a perpetual license: If the technical support service subscription expires and customer elects not to renew, BlackBerry will cease providing technical support services and other benefits of technical support services as described in this Program Description as of the expiration date. To reinstate the applicable technical support service, the customer must, in addition to entering into a new technical support service term, pay the Back Support Fee and the Reinstatement Fee outlined as follows: (A) Back Support Fee is the technical support service fee associated with the perpetual licenses for the period beginning on the day following the applicable subscription expiration date to the current date, calculated on a pro- rated basis and rounded up to the nearest month, at the then-current MSRP; and (B) Reinstatement Fee is the greater of: a) fifty percent (50 of the Back Support Fee; or b) 1,000 USD. When technical support has lapsed, unless and until BlackBerry accepts an order to reinstate customer s technical support service (either directly, or through a channel partner) which includes the Back Support Fee and the Reinstatement Fee, BlackBerry shall not be obligated to provide technical support services to the customer. With regard to technical support services included in a software subscription license: The technical support service will expire at the end of the then-current subscription license term. Customer will no longer have the right to use the corresponding BlackBerry Solution or receive technical support services. If customer does not deprovision all Authorized Users from the applicable BlackBerry Solution on or before the expiration date, in order to reinstate the subscription licenses and the associated technical support services, BlackBerry must receive and accept an order from customer (either directly, or through a channel partner) for a new subscription and such order shall include the Lapsed Fee and the Subscription Reinstatement Fee outlined as follows: 3

SOFTWARE SUPPORT LIFECYCLE Organizations are encouraged to upgrade to the most recent software versions of each component of BlackBerry enterprise software. When organizations install software upgrades or updates, they are able to take advantage of the latest productivity-enhancing administration features. To achieve a high level of support excellence, BlackBerry limits the number of software versions for any component of the BlackBerry Enterprise Solution that will be supported through BlackBerry Maintenance and Support Services. The following policies determine whether a version is supported: Support is offered for the current shipping version of any software element of the BlackBerry Enterprise Solution when it operates in a supported configuration; Support is generally offered for the previous software release for a period of twelve (12) months after the release of the current shipping version. When product problems are encountered in previous releases, an upgrade to the current shipping software release may be necessary in order to fix the problem; and Software Updates and hotfixes are generally produced for the current shipping version only. The creation of Software Updates and hotfixes for previous versions may be evaluated by BlackBerry on a case-by-case basis. BlackBerry Technical Support uses a Software Support Lifecycle to determine which BlackBerry enterprise software versions are eligible for support. Please visit the following website to view product support timelines for all BlackBerry Software: BlackBerry Software Support Lifecycle Note: Once a version of software is no longer covered as part of the Software Support Lifecycle, no software patches, fixes or workarounds will be generated to resolve the issue. If an issue cannot be resolved without one of these steps, an upgrade to a supported software version will be required in order for any additional troubleshooting to take place. Additional charges may apply. See Annex 2. CUSTOMER RESPONSIBILITIES After the Level 1 Support team has determined the nature of your issue, to effectively troubleshoot and resolve a problem, BlackBerry may require customers to provide records, such as log files or configuration files.

The parties agree to enter into other standard contractual clauses approved under Data Protection Laws to effectuate the Restricted Transfers of Personal Data for purposes of providing the Services. 

24 3.4. The parties further agree that if any of the EU Standard Contractual Clauses or the UK Addendum are updated, replaced, or are no longer available for any reason, the parties will cooperate in good faith to implement updated or replacement Standard Contractual Clauses, as appropriate, or identify an alternative mechanism(s) to authorize the contemplated Restricted Transfers. 4. Deletion or Return of Personal Data. Following expiration or termination of the Agreement, at Seller s request, Arctic Wolf shall return or delete the Personal Data (including Personal Data in the possession of Authorized Sub- Processors), unless further storage of Personal Data is required by applicable law. If return or destruction is impracticable or prohibited by law, rule or regulation, Arctic Wolf shall take measures to block such Personal Data from any further Processing (except to the extent necessary for its continued hosting or Processing required by law, rule, or regulation) and shall continue to appropriately protect the Personal Data remaining in its possession, custody, or control and to continue to comply with this Addendum for so long at Arctic Wolf continues to have possession, custody, or control of the Personal Data. The parties agree that the certification of deletion of Personal Data that is described in Clause 8.5 of the Standard Contractual Clauses or Clause 12(1) of the UK Standard Contractual Clauses shall be provided by Arctic Wolf to Seller only upon Seller s request. 5. Audits. Taking into account the nature of the Processing and the information available to Arctic Wolf, Arctic Wolf shall provide reasonable assistance in response to inquiries from Seller or a competent Regulator relating to Arctic Wolf s Processing of Seller s Personal Data. 5.1. Arctic Wolf shall, upon written request from Seller, provide Seller with information reasonably necessary to demonstrate compliance with its obligations set forth in this Addendum. This information shall consist of permitting examination of the most recent reports, certificates and/or extracts prepared by an independent auditor pursuant to Arctic Wolf s ISO27001 or similarly held industry certification. 5.2. In the event the information provided in accordance with Section 5.1 above is insufficient to reasonably demonstrate compliance, Arctic Wolf shall permit Seller, or Seller s third party auditor (provided such auditor is not a competitor to Arctic Wolf or provides products and/or services to a competitor of Arctic Wolf) to inspect or audit the technical and organisational measures of Arctic Wolf for the purposes of monitoring compliance with Arctic Wolf s obligations under this Addendum. Any such audit or inspection shall be: (i) at Seller s expense; (ii) limited in scope to matters specific to Seller; (iii) agreed in advance between the parties in writing, including scope, duration, and start date; (iv) conducted in a way that does not interfere with Arctic Wolf s day-to-day business; (v) during local business hours of Arctic Wolf and, upon not less than twenty (20) business days advance written notice unless, in Seller s reasonable belief that a Personal Data Breach or an identifiable, material breach of this Addendum has arisen; (vi) limited to no more than once per any twelve (12) calendar month period, except if (i) required by instruction of a competent Regulator; or (ii) in case of a Personal Data Brach; and (vii) subject to the confidentiality obligations in the Agreement or, where a third-party auditor conducts the audit, such third-party auditor must be a professional bound by a duty of confidentiality or subject to a suitable non-disclosure agreement. 5.3. Seller will provide Arctic Wolf with copies of any audit reports generated in connection with any audit under this Section, unless prohibited by the applicable Data Protection Law. Seller may use the audit reports only for the purposes of meeting its regulatory audit requirements and/or confirming compliance with the requirements of this Addendum. 5.4. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section 5 shall also apply to the audit provisions of any Standard Contractual Clauses entered into in accordance with Section 3 of this Addendum. 6. Authorized Sub-Processors 6.1. Seller consents to the use of Authorized Subprocessors to deliver the Services. The current list of Authorized Subprocessors is attached in Schedule III. 6.2. Seller agrees it may subscribe to receive notifications related to the modification to the Authorized Subprocessors. 

25 At least ten (10) days before enabling any third party other than current Authorized Subprocessors to access or participate in the Processing of Personal Data, Arctic Wolf will add such third party to the Authorized Subprocessor list posted at https://arcticwolf.com/terms/sub-processors/. If Seller reasonably believes the third party cannot comply with the requirements this Addendum or has another reasonable basis for objecting to the third party, Seller may object to the addition of any such third parties to the List by informing Arctic Wolf in writing within ten (10) days of receipt of the aforementioned notice by Seller. If Seller objects to such change, and Arctic Wolf cannot provide a commercially reasonable alternative within a reasonable period of time, the parties may terminate the Agreement. Arctic Wolf will refund any prepaid fees on a pro rata basis for the terminated portion(s) of the Services that were to be provided after the effective date of termination or as otherwise set forth pursuant to the termination provision within the Agreement. This termination right is Seller s sole and exclusive remedy if Seller objects to any newly added Authorized Subprocessor. If Seller does not object to the engagement of a third party within ten (10) days of notice by Arctic Wolf that third party will be deemed an Authorized Subprocessors for the purposes of this Addendum. 6.3. Arctic Wolf will enter into a written agreement with each Authorized Subprocessors that requires the Authorized Subprocessor to (1) protect Personal Data to the same extent required by Arctic Wolf under this Addendum, and (2) be in compliance with Data Protection Laws. Arctic Wolf will remain liable to Seller for all actions by each Authorized Subprocessor with respect to the Personal Data. 6.4. Arctic Wolf may replace an Authorized Subprocessor without advance notice where the reason for the change is outside of Arctic Wolf s reasonable control and prompt replacement is required for security or other urgent reasons. In this case, Arctic Wolf will inform Seller of the replacement subprocessor as soon as possible following its appointment. Section 6.2 applies accordingly. 7. Security of Personal Data. Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of Processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, Arctic Wolf shall maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of Processing Personal Data as set forth in Schedule III. Arctic Wolf will regularly monitor compliance with such security standards and will not materially decrease the security standards during the term of the Agreement. 8. Rights of Data Subjects 8.1. If Arctic Wolf directly receives any complaint or request from a Data Subject to exercise his/her rights under Data Protection Laws Data Subject Request in relation to Seller s Personal Data and Seller is identified or identifiable from the request without the need for any independent investigation, Arctic Wolf will promptly (and in any case within five (5) business days of receipt) forward such Data Subject Request to Seller, unless otherwise required by the applicable Data Protection Law. Seller is solely responsible for ensuring that Data Subject Requests for erasure, restriction or cessation of Processing, or withdrawal of consent to Processing of any Personal Data are communicated to Arctic Wolf, and for ensuring that a record of consent to Processing is maintained with respect to each Data Subject. 8.2. Arctic Wolf shall, at the request of the Seller, and taking into account the nature of the Processing applicable to any Data Subject Request, cooperate with Seller with respect to any action taken relating to the Data Subject Request and apply appropriate technical and organizational measures to assist Seller in complying with Seller s obligation to respond to a Data Subject Request and/or in demonstrating such compliance, where possible, provided that (i) Seller is itself unable to respond without Arctic Wolf s assistance and (ii) Arctic Wolf is able to do so in accordance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. Seller shall be responsible to the extent legally permitted for any reasonable costs and expenses arising from any such assistance by Arctic Wolf. 9. Actions and Access Requests 9.1. Where Seller is obligated by Data Protection Laws to carry out a data protection impact assessment DPIA relating to Seller s use of the Services, Arctic Wolf shall provide reasonable cooperation and assistance to Seller 

26 for the DPIA to allow Seller to comply with its obligations under the Data Protection Laws. Seller shall be responsible to the extent legally permitted for any reasonable costs and expenses arising from any such assistance by Arctic Wolf and Arctic Wolf shall be entitled to involve Seller at Arctic Wolf s then-current rates for any time expended in assisting with the DPIA. 9.2. Arctic Wolf shall provide Seller with reasonable assistance to Seller in cooperation or prior consultation with any Regulator as may be required by Data Protection Laws. Seller shall be responsible to the extent legally permitted for any reasonable costs and expenses arising from any such assistance by Arctic Wolf and Arctic Wolf shall be entitled to involve Seller at Arctic Wolf s then-current rates for any time expended in providing such assistance. 9.3. If Arctic Wolf receives any order, demand, warrant or any other document requesting or purporting to compel the production of Personal Data (including, for example, by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents in legal proceedings, subpoenas, civil or criminal investigative demands or other similar processes) by any competent authority Production Request ), Arctic Wolf will immediately notify Seller, except to the extent prohibited by applicable law. If the Production Request is not legally valid and binding, Arctic Wolf will not respond. If a Production Request is legally valid and binding, Arctic Wolf will provide Seller with at least forty- eight (48) hours notice prior to the required disclosure, so that Seller may, at its own expense, exercise such rights as it may have under applicable law to prevent or limit such disclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Arctic Wolf will exercise commercially reasonable efforts to prevent and limit any such disclosure and to otherwise preserve the confidentiality of Personal Data and will cooperate with Seller with respect to any action taken relating to such Production Request, including to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to Personal Data. 10. Personal Data Breach. Whenever Arctic Wolf reasonably believes that there has been a Personal Data Breach of Seller s Personal Data Processed by Arctic Wolf or its Authorized Subprocessors, Arctic Wolf shall (i) notify Seller of the Personal Data Breach without undue delay (and in no event more than seventy-two (72) hours); (ii) take all steps it deems necessary and reasonable (in its sole discretion) to investigate and remediate the Personal Data Breach, to the extent that remediation is within Arctic Wolf s reasonable control; (iii) provide Seller with reasonable cooperation and assistance necessary for Seller to comply with its obligations under the applicable Data Protection Laws relating to the Personal Data Breach; and (iv) provide Seller with details about the Personal Data Breach. The obligations described in this Section 10 shall not apply in the event that a Personal Data Breach results from the actions or omissions of Seller. For the avoidance of doubt, a Personal Data Breach will not include unsuccessful attempts to, or activities that do not or are unlikely to, compromise the confidentiality, availability, or integrity of Personal Data including, without limitation, unsuccessful log in attempts, unsuccessful denial of service attacks and other attacks on firewalls or networked systems and no notice of the foregoing shall be required. In the event a Personal Data Breach requires notification by Seller to Data Subjects or relevant Regulators, the parties agree to coordinate in good faith on developing the content of any public statements or required notices. 11. Liability. [Redacted: Confidential legal terms relating to risk allocation between the Parties.] 12. Changes in Data Protection Laws. The parties agree to negotiate in good faith modifications to this Addendum if changes are required for Arctic Wolf to continue to Process Personal Data in compliance with Data Protection Laws, including but not limited to (i) the GDPR; (ii) the CCPA; (iii) any Standard Contractual Clauses; or (iv) if changes to the membership status of a country in the European Union or the European Economic Area require such modification. 13. Confidentiality. The confidentiality terms in the Agreement shall apply to this Addendum and where applicable, the Standard Contractual Clauses. 14. Miscellaneous. 14.1. Conflicts. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this Addendum and the Agreement, the terms of this Addendum shall prevail. In the event and to the extent of any conflict or inconsistency between the body of this Addendum and the Standard Contractual Clauses in a way that materially affects the adequacy of the transfer, the Standard Contractual Clauses shall prevail. 

27 14.2. Severability. In the event any provision of this Addendum, in whole or in part, is invalid, unenforceable or in conflict with the applicable laws or regulations of any jurisdiction, such provision will be replaced, to the extent possible, with a provision which accomplishes the original business purposes of the provision in a valid and enforceable manner, and the remainder of this Addendum will remain unaffected and in full force. 14.3. Counterparts. This Addendum may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed and original and all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties; it being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterparts.
