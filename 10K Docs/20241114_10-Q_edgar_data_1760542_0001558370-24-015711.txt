 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of 387.8 million. The Company expects to continue to generate operating losses in the foreseeable future. As of the filing date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company s expectation to generate negative operating cash flows in the future and the need for additional funding to support its planned operations raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date that these condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. Management's plans to alleviate the conditions that raise substantial doubt include reduced spending and the pursuit of additional capital. Management has concluded that the likelihood that its plan to successfully obtain sufficient funding, or adequately reduce expenditures, while reasonably possible, is less than probable. Accordingly, the Company has concluded that substantial doubt exists about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements. These condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not reflect any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of the uncertainties described above.

 . Fractional shares were not issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Stockholders who were otherwise entitled to receive a fractional share received a proportional cash payment. The Reverse Stock Split affected all stockholders uniformly and did not alter any stockholder s relative interest in the Company s equity securities, except for any adjustments for fractional shares. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, proportionate adjustments were made to the conversion ratio for the Company s Class A Common Stock and the conversion prices of the Company s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock and Series A-2 Convertible Preferred Stock. All share, per share and option numbers and exercise prices appearing in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the accompanying condensed financial statements have been adjusted to give effect to the Reverse Stock Split for all prior periods presented. However, the Company s annual, other periodic, and current reports, and all other information and documents incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that were filed prior to July 9, 2024, do not give effect to the Reverse Stock Split.

 preclinical research programs to evaluate potential vaccine products for the treatment, cure, diagnosis or prevention of the hepatitis B virus HBV and the human immunodeficiency virus HIV ). In February 2022, the parties signed an amended and restated collaboration agreement (the Restated Gilead Collaboration Agreement ), which revised the terms only for the HIV program, whereby the Company took on development responsibilities for the HIV program candidate through a Phase 1b clinical trial. The Company s performance obligations under the terms of the original agreement include combined performance obligation for each research program (HBV and HIV) comprised of the transfer of intellectual property rights (licenses) and providing research and development services. The terms of the Restated Gilead Collaboration Agreement added an additional performance obligation to perform research and development work for the HIV program. The licenses do not represent distinct performance obligations, because they cannot be used without the research and development services. Payments to the Company under the Restated Gilead Collaboration Agreement include a non-refundable up-front payment, payments for research and development activities, payments based upon the achievement of defined milestones, and if certain future conditions are met, payments for manufacturing services, commercial milestones and royalties on product sales. Under the research collaboration and license agreement with Roche (the Roche Collaboration Agreement ), the Company agreed to conduct research and early clinical development through Phase 1b for HB-700, a novel investigational arenaviral immunotherapy for the treatment of KRAS-mutated cancers. The Roche Collaboration

 combined performance obligation for the transfer of intellectual property rights (licenses) and providing research and development services for the HB-700 program, and a second, separate performance obligation to perform research and development services with respect to the UCA program. The UCA Option provided a right to license the program at the standalone selling price and therefore did not constitute a separate performance obligation. Payments to the Company under the Roche Collaboration Agreement included a non-refundable up-front payment, payments based upon the achievement of defined milestones, an additional payment if the option for the UCA program was exercised and royalties on product sales. In January 2024, Roche provided written notice of the termination of the collaboration and licensing agreement to the Company resulting in early recognition of revenue previously recorded as deferred revenue. The termination was made according to Roche s right to terminate without cause, acknowledging that, the Company had met all go-forward criteria under the agreement. Upon the collaboration and licensing agreement termination effective date of April 25, 2024, the Company regained full control of the associated intellectual property portfolio and has full collaboration and licensing rights for this program. The Company evaluates its collaboration and licensing arrangements pursuant to ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. To determine the recognition of revenue from arrangements that fall within the scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation. Under ASC 606, the Company applies significant judgement to evaluate whether the promises under the collaboration and licensing arrangements represent separate or one or more combined performance obligations, the allocation of the transaction price to identified performance obligations, the timing of revenue recognition, whether the UCA Option constitutes a material right, and the determination of when milestone payments are probable of being received. Upfront payment and program initiation fee The non-refundable upfront-payment received by the Company upon signing of the Gilead Collaboration Agreement, and milestone payments that were linked to future performance obligations, were initially recorded as deferred revenue and allocated between the research program performance obligations. Such amounts are recognized as revenue over the performance period of the respective services on a percent of completion basis using total estimated research and development labor hours (input method) for each of the obligations. The percent of completion basis using labor hours was considered the best measure of progress in which control of the combined performance obligations transfers to the customer, due to the short time intervals in which research results are shared with the collaboration partner and the nature of the work being performed. The non-refundable program initiation payment received from Gilead upon signing of the Restated Collaboration Agreement was also initially recorded as deferred revenue and is recognized on a percent of completion basis using total estimated research and development costs (input method) for the performance of the obligations. The percent of completion basis using research and development costs was considered the best measure of progress in which control of the performance obligations transfers to the customer, due to the immediate benefit that it adds to the value of the customer s rights on the program, the short time intervals in which development results are shared and the nature of the work being performed. The non-refundable upfront-payment received by the Company upon signing of the Roche Collaboration Agreement was initially recorded as deferred revenue and allocated between the HB-700 program and the UCA

 preclinical research programs to evaluate potential vaccine products for the treatment, cure, diagnosis or prevention of HBV and HIV. In February 2022, the Company signed the Amended and Restated Collaboration Agreement, which altered key aspects of the collaboration pertaining to the HIV therapeutic. Most importantly, the Amended and Restated Collaboration Agreement allocated additional research and development responsibility to the Company with respect to the Company s HIV candidate and provided for additional funding by Gilead of such research and development activities as well as increased later stage development and commercial milestone payments. Under the Gilead Collaboration Agreement, the Company granted Gilead an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to the Company s technology platforms. Upon entering into the agreement in June 2018, the Company received a non-refundable million upfront payment from Gilead and upon signing of the Restated Gilead Collaboration Agreement in February 2022, the Company received a program initiation fee of million. Gilead is also obligated to make additional payments to the Company upon the achievement of pre-clinical, development and commercial milestones. The development milestones amount to million for the HBV program, and up to million for the HIV program, inclusive of a million program completion fee, payable upon Gilead s exercise of the option to pursue further development activities post Phase 1b. The commercial milestones amount to a total of million for the HBV program, and million for the HIV program. Additionally, Gilead is obligated to pay royalties on net sales for each program. Payments from Gilead generally have a -day payment term. The million upfront payment, the million initiation fee and million in milestone payments were initially recorded as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheet and are recognized as revenue when revenue recognition criteria are met. As of September 30, 2024, million of such payments were still recorded as a liability in deferred revenues, current and non-current. As of December 31, 2023, million of upfront and milestone payments were included as a liability in deferred revenues, current and non-current. Approximately of deferred revenue is expected to be recognized as revenue in the remainder of 2024, in 2025 and the remaining in 2026. In the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized million of the milestone and initiation payments that were originally recorded as deferred revenue. Furthermore, the Company recognized million of revenue from cost reimbursements for research and development services. In the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized million of the upfront and milestone payments that were originally

 million of revenue from cost reimbursements for research and development services. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized million of the milestone and initiation payments that were originally recorded as deferred revenue. Furthermore, the Company recognized million of revenue from cost reimbursements for research and development services. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized million of the upfront and milestone payments that were originally recorded as deferred revenue. Furthermore, the Company recognized million of revenue from cost reimbursements for research and development services. Sublicense fees payable to certain licensors of technologies upon the receipt of the deferred upfront and milestone payments, were capitalized as a contract asset and will be amortized over the period in which the revenue from the triggering payment is recognized. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the contract asset relating to the sublicense payment was million and million, respectively, and there was liability relating to sublicense payment. Roche Collaboration and License Agreement In October 2022, the Company entered into the Roche Collaboration Agreement whereby the Company and Roche agreed to collaborate with respect to the development of novel arenaviral immunotherapies for KRAS-mutated cancers and, potentially, a second, novel arenaviral immunotherapeutic program targeting specific undisclosed cancer antigens. In January 2024, Roche provided written notice of the termination of the Roche Collaboration Agreement to the Company. The termination was made according to Roche s right to terminate without cause, acknowledging that the Company had met all go-forward criteria under the agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Roche Collaboration Agreement, following the termination notice, the Roche Collaboration Agreement terminated on April 25, 2024. Under the terms of the original Roche Collaboration Agreement, the Company had granted Roche an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to the Company s technology platforms for KRAS-mutated cancers, and an option right to exclusively license a second, novel arenaviral immunotherapeutic program targeting undisclosed cancer antigens. Upon the termination effective date of April 25, 2024, the Company regained full control of the associated intellectual property portfolio and full collaboration and licensing rights for this program. Upon signing the Roche Collaboration Agreement in October 2022, the Company received a non-refundable upfront payment of million. This upfront payment, a million milestone payment received in the three months ended March 31, 2023, and a million milestone payment received in the three months ended June 30, 2024 were considered as part of the transaction price and were recognized as revenue when revenue recognition criteria were met over the period in which services were performed. As of September 30, 2024, liabilities were recorded in deferred revenues, current and non-current. As of December 31, 2023, million of such payments were included as a liability in deferred revenues, current and non-current. The Company considered the termination by Roche as a contract modification of the combined performance obligations and the transaction price. The modification was accounted for on a cumulative catch-up basis, applying the revised percent of completion to the revised transaction price, resulting in an immediate increase of revenue in the period of the modification. The transaction price was recognized as revenue over the remaining performance period using updated total estimated research and development costs. The remaining liability included in deferred revenues was recognized in the three months ended June 30, 2024. Accordingly, the Company recognized in the three months ended September 30, 2024 no revenue of the upfront and milestone payments that were originally recorded as deferred revenue. In the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized million of the upfront and milestone payments that were originally recorded as deferred

 million of revenue from cost reimbursements for activities related to the preparation of a first in human trial. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized revenues of million of the upfront and milestone payments that were originally recorded as deferred revenue. Furthermore, the Company recognized million of revenue from cost reimbursements for activities related to the preparation of a first in human trial of HB-700. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized million of the upfront and milestone payments that were originally recorded as deferred revenue. Furthermore, the Company recognized million of revenue from cost reimbursements for activities related to the preparation of a first in human trial.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors section of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year end December 31, 2023, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. Overview We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a new class of immunotherapeutics based on our proprietary arenavirus platform that is designed to target and amplify T cell and immune responses to fight diseases. Our replicating and non-replicating technologies are engineered to induce robust and durable antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses and pathogen-neutralizing antibodies. We believe that our technologies can meaningfully leverage the human immune system for therapeutic purposes by inducing CD8+ T cell response levels previously not achieved by other immune therapy approaches. We are building a proprietary immuno-oncology pipeline utilizing our replicating technology. Our oncology portfolio targets oncoviral cancer antigens and next-generation antigens and includes two primary programs in development: eseba-vec (formerly HB-200) and HB-700. Eseba-vec is in clinical development for the treatment of Human Papillomavirus 16-positive HPV16+ head and neck cancers. Eseba-vec in combination with pembrolizumab received Fast Track Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA in January 2022 and PRIME designation from the European Medicines Agency in April 2024 for the treatment of first-line HPV16+ recurrent/metastatic oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. In April 2024, we received Investigational New Drug IND clearance from the FDA for HB-700 for the treatment of KRAS mutated cancers, including, lung, colorectal and pancreatic cancers. Our strategic priority has been the development of our oncology portfolio, most importantly the advancement of our eseba-vec program, and the initiation of the AVALON-1 trial, a randomized Phase 2/3 trial of eseba-vec. Additionally, we are developing infectious disease therapies in partnership with other companies. Our Hepatitis B HBV program, HB-400, and our Human Immunodeficiency Virus HIV program, HB-500, are developed in a partnership with Gilead Sciences Inc. Gilead ). Eseba-vec, our first program in oncology, is being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial for the treatment of HPV16+ cancers. This trial has completed enrollment in Phase 2 and is evaluating eseba-vec therapy in combination with pembrolizumab in the first line setting of HPV16+ PD-L1+ oropharynx cancer. In November, we reported updated eseba-vec clinical 1L results in patients with HPV16+ PD-L1+ oropharynx cancer from the Phase 2 part of the Phase 1/2 H-200-001 study, which also now included data for the selected Phase 3 dose. The study reported data as of the September 30, 2024 data cut-off with 66 participants treated with eseba-vec + pembrolizumab, of which at present 30/66 (45.5 participants remain on treatment in the study. Efficacy data was reported specifically in the PD-L1 CPS 20 population, selected for further development, with a reported overall response rate ORR of 55.0 (16 complete response) in the 20 evaluable for response by RECIST v1.1 participants who were treated at the selected Phase 3 dose of eseba-vec (includes confirmed and unconfirmed responses), and 52 ORR (15 complete response) in the 25 participants treated with both dose levels. The disease control rate DCR was 75 and 80 , respectively. This was accompanied by a promising DOR with 60.0 and 66.7 , respectively, of confirmed responders ongoing at the time of reporting. Early PFS and OS are encouraging but still maturing and in patients treated with all dose levels, the median PFS is 16.3 months, while the reported 12-month OS rate was 83 . Clinical activity continues to be supported by a rapid, robust, and durable tumor antigen specific T cell response. The data continues to show a pronounced potential on the background of historical data reported for SoC pembrolizumab alone (19 ORR and 3.4m mPFS). The combination treatment of eseba-vec with pembrolizumab demonstrated a 

 28 

Table of Contents 
 favorable safety profile with manageable toxicity with mostly mild to moderate toxicity and serious adverse events in only 7.6 and adverse events leading to discontinuation in only 4.5 of participants. The results of the study successfully confirm the selected patient population of 1 st line HPV16+ PD-L1 CPS 20 R/M oropharyngeal cancer as well as the selected Phase 3 eseba-vec dose in combination with pembrolizumab which is to be taken forward. HB-700 was designed for treatment of cancers encoding mutated KRAS, especially KRAS-mutated pancreatic, colorectal, and lung cancers. By simultaneously targeting the five most common mutations, we believe HB-700 has the potential to benefit more patients than single mutation inhibitors. In April 2024, we received FDA clearance of our IND application for HB-700. In October 2022, we entered into a Research Collaboration and License Agreement (the Roche Collaboration Agreement ), with Roche to (i) grant Roche an exclusive license to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize our pre-clinical HB-700 cancer program, an arenaviral immunotherapeutic for KRAS-mutated cancers, and (ii) grant Roche an option right to exclusively license for research, development manufacturing and commercialization, a second, novel arenaviral immunotherapeutic program targeting undisclosed cancer antigens. We announced in January 2024 that we received notification from Roche of their decision to terminate the collaboration and licensing agreement for our HB-700 program in KRAS mutated cancers. Effective April 25, 2024, we regained full control of the associated intellectual property portfolio and have full collaboration and licensing rights for this program. Pursuant to the Roche Collaboration Agreement, we received a non-refundable upfront payment of 25.0 million, and milestone payments of 20.0 million. We are collaborating with Gilead Sciences, Inc. Gilead to research arenavirus functional cures for chronic Hepatitis B and HIV infections under a Collaboration and License Agreement signed in 2018 (the Gilead Collaboration Agreement ). Both programs have completed preclinical research, and in April 2023 the first participant in a Phase 1 clinical trial of the Hepatitis B product candidate being conducted by Gilead was dosed. Gilead is solely responsible for further development and commercialization of the Hepatitis B product candidate and we are eligible for up to a further 185.0 million in development and commercialization milestone payments, plus tiered royalties. According to the amendment to the Gilead Collaboration Agreement, signed in February 2022, we have taken on development responsibilities for the HIV program candidate through a Phase 1b clinical trial and Gilead will provide funding through a combination of an initiation payment of 15.0 million, a milestone payment of 5.0 million and equity contributions of up to 35.0 million. In November 2023, we received FDA clearance of our IND application for HB-500 and started the Phase 1b trial in the second quarter of 2024. The first person was dosed on July 1, 2024, resulting in the achievement of a 5.0 million milestone payment which was received on July 25, 2024. Gilead retains the exclusive option, to further develop and commercialize the HIV program, in which case we are eligible for up to a further 227.5 million in developmental and commercialization milestone payments, inclusive of a 10.0 million option exercise payment, plus tiered royalties. On January 29, 2024, we announced our decision to prioritize the clinical development of our eseba-vec program for the treatment of HPV16+ head and neck cancers and our two Gilead-partnered infectious disease programs and to pause development activities related to HB-300, targeting self-antigens for the treatment of prostate cancer, and most of our preclinical research activities. In connection with this strategic refocus, our Board of Directors approved a plan to reduce our workforce by 55 full-time employees, or approximately 30 of the then-current employee base, and to rebalance our cost structure in alignment with the new prioritization of research and development programs. The prioritization of our eseba-vec program and our two Gilead-partnered programs also included the discontinuation of our GMP manufacturing facility project. This part of the restructuring plan was completed by the end of the second quarter of 2024. Additionally, in September 2024, our Board of Directors approved a plan to reduce our workforce by another 28 employees, or approximately 20 of the then-current employe base, and to further rebalance our cost structure in alignment with the prioritization of clinical development programs. We announced and began the implementation of this additional restructuring plan in the third quarter of 2024 and we expect the restructuring to be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of 2025. Going forward, we may implement further cost-saving initiatives that could result in additional restructuring charges including severance and other employee charges.

 We have funded our operations to date primarily from public offerings of common stock and convertible preferred stock, including our initial public offering, as well as private placements of our redeemable convertible preferred stock, grant funding and loans from an Austrian government agency, and upfront, milestone and initiation payments from Gilead and Roche in connection with our respective collaboration and license agreements. As of September 30, 2024 we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of 60.0 million. We do not expect to generate revenue from any product candidates that we develop until we obtain regulatory approval for one or more of such product candidates, if at all, and commercialize our products or enter into additional collaboration agreements with third parties. Substantially all of our net losses have resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. All of our product candidates, including our most advanced oncology product candidate, eseba-vec, will require substantial additional development time and resources before we would be able to apply for and receive regulatory approvals and begin generating revenue from product sales. We currently have no marketing and sales organization and have no experience in marketing products; accordingly, we will incur significant expenses to develop a marketing organization and sales force in advance of generating any commercial product sales. As a result, we will need substantial additional capital to support our operating activities. In addition, we expect to continue to incur legal, accounting and other expenses in operating our business, including the costs associated with operating as a public company. We currently anticipate that we will seek to fund our operations through equity or debt financings or other sources, such as government grants and additional collaboration agreements with third parties. Adequate funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If sufficient funds on acceptable terms are not available when needed, we will be required to significantly reduce our operating expenses and delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our development programs. We have incurred recurring losses, including net losses of 13.8 million and 18.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 387.8 million and we do not expect positive cash flows from operations in the foreseeable future, if ever. We expect to continue to incur net operating losses for at least the next several years as we advance our product candidates through clinical development, seek regulatory approval, prepare for and, if approved, proceed to commercialization, continue our research and development efforts and invest to establish further commercial manufacturing capacity. Impacts of Market Conditions on Our Business Unfavorable conditions in the economy in the United States, Austria and elsewhere may negatively affect the growth of our business and our results of operations. Macroeconomic events and conditions such as heightened inflation, increased interest rates, disruptions to global financial markets or a recession or other market correction, including as a result of the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the related sanctions imposed against Russia, any escalation of the conflict in the Middle East, and other global macroeconomic factors, could reduce our ability to access capital, which could materially impact our business and the value of our common stock. Components of Our Results of Operations Revenue from collaboration and licensing To date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to do so in the near future, if at all. All of our revenue to date has been derived from research collaboration and license agreements with Gilead and Roche.

 Gilead Collaboration Agreement On June 4, 2018, we entered into the Gilead Collaboration Agreement to evaluate potential vaccine products using or incorporating our replicating technology and non-replicating technology for the treatment, cure, diagnosis or prevention of HBV and HIV. Under the Gilead Collaboration Agreement, we granted Gilead an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to our technology platform for researching, developing, manufacturing and commercializing products for HIV or HBV. We received a non-refundable 10.0 million upfront payment upon entering the Gilead Collaboration Agreement. In February 2022, we signed an amended and restated collaboration agreement (the Restated Gilead Collaboration Agreement which revised the terms only for the HIV program, whereby we took on development responsibilities for the HIV program candidate through a Phase 1b clinical trial. Pursuant to the Restated Gilead Collaboration Agreement, Gilead retains an exclusive right (the Option to take back the development responsibilities, thus keeping the rights for the HIV program, including further development and commercialization in return for an option exercise payment of 10.0 million. Pursuant to the Restated Gilead Collaboration Agreement, we are eligible for up to 140.0 million in developmental milestone payments for the HBV program and 50.0 million in commercialization milestone payments. If Gilead exercises the Option, we are eligible for up to 172.5 million in developmental milestone payments for the HIV program, inclusive of the 10.0 million Option exercise payment, and 65.0 million in commercialization milestone payments for the HIV program. Upon the commercialization of a product, we are eligible to receive tiered royalties of a high single-digit to mid-teens percentage on the worldwide net sales of each HBV product, and royalties of a mid-single-digit to 10 of worldwide net sales of each HIV product. Gilead is obligated to reimburse us for our costs, including all benefits, travel, overhead, and any other expenses, relating to performing research and development activities under the Restated Gilead Collaboration Agreement with respect to the HBV program, and if the Option is exercised, any manufacturing costs related to the HIV program. Through September 30, 2024, we have received a non-refundable upfront payment of 10.0 million, a program initiation fee of 15.0 million, a 5.0 million milestone payment for the first person dosed in a Phase 1b clinical trial of HB-500 and 21.2 million in milestone payments for the achievement of pre-clinical research milestones from Gilead. In addition, we have recognized 42.7 million of cost reimbursements for research and development services performed under the Restated Gilead Collaboration Agreement. We determined that our performance obligations under the terms of the original Gilead Collaboration Agreement included one combined performance obligation for each of the HBV and HIV research programs, comprised of the transfer of intellectual property rights and providing research and development services. Accordingly, we recognized these amounts as revenue over the performance period of the respective services on a percent of completion basis using total estimated research and development labor hours for each of the performance obligations. The terms of the Restated Gilead Collaboration Agreement added an additional performance obligation to us to perform research and development work for the HIV program. We recognize the amounts of revenue allocated to the performance obligation resulting from the Restated Gilead Collaboration Agreement on a percent of completion basis over the performance period, using total estimated research and development costs as the measure of progress. Roche Collaboration Agreement On October 18, 2022, we entered into the Roche Collaboration Agreement to (i) grant Roche an exclusive license to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize our pre-clinical HB-700 cancer program, an arenaviral immunotherapeutic for KRAS-mutated cancers, and (ii) grant Roche an exclusive option right to exclusively license for research, development manufacturing and commercialization, a second, novel arenaviral immunotherapeutic program targeting undisclosed cancer antigens. In January 2024, Roche provided us with written notice of the termination of the collaboration and licensing agreement. Under the terms of the terminated Roche Collaboration Agreement, we granted Roche an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to our technology platforms for KRAS-mutated cancers, and an option right to exclusively license a second, novel arenaviral immunotherapeutic program targeting undisclosed cancer antigens. Pursuant to the terms of the Roche Collaboration Agreement, following the termination notice, the Roche Collaboration Agreement was terminated on April 25, 2024. Effective April 25, 2024, we regained full control of the associated intellectual property portfolio and have full collaboration and licensing rights for the KRAS program.

 Through September 30, 2024, we have received from Roche the non-refundable upfront payment of 25.0 million, 10.0 million in milestone payments for the achievement of a GMP manufacturing milestone under the HB-700 program and 10.0 million in milestone payments associated with an IND submission for the HB-700 program. In addition, we have recognized 0.6 million of cost reimbursements for research and development activities related to a first human trial. We determined that our performance obligations under the terms of the Roche Collaboration Agreement included one combined performance obligation for the transfer of intellectual property rights (licenses) and providing research and development services for the HB-700 program, and a second, separate performance obligation during the UCA Option period to perform research and development services with respect to the UCA Program. Accordingly, we allocated the non-refundable upfront payment of 25.0 million between the two performance obligations. Milestone payments that were contingent on future events were added to the transaction price when the triggering event became probable. The consideration allocated to a performance obligation has been recognized as revenue over the performance period of the respective services on a percent of completion basis using total estimated research and development costs for each of the performance obligations. Milestone payments, or parts thereof, that related to completed services were reflected via a cumulative catch up for past performance. Operating Expenses Our operating expenses since inception have only consisted of research and development costs, general and administrative costs and restructuring and impairment expenses. Research and Development Expenses Since our inception, we have focused significant resources on our research and development activities, including establishing our arenavirus platform, conducting preclinical studies, developing a manufacturing process, conducting Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, including the ongoing eseba-vec (formerly HB-200) clinical trials, and progressing IND applications, including for HB-700. Research and development activities account for a significant portion of our operating expenses. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. These costs include: salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel engaged in research and development functions; expenses incurred in connection with the preclinical development of our programs and clinical trials of our product candidates, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants, contractors, academic institutions and contract research organizations CROs ); the cost of manufacturing drug products for use in clinical trials, including under agreements with third parties, such as CMOs, consultants and contractors; laboratory costs; leased facility costs, equipment depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses; and third-party license fees. 
 The majority of our research and development costs are external costs, which we track on a program-by-program basis. We do not track our internal research and development expenses on a program-by-program basis as they primarily relate to shared costs deployed across multiple projects under development. We expect our research and development expenses to increase substantially in the future as we advance our existing and future product candidates into and through clinical trials and pursue regulatory approval. The process of

 conducting the necessary clinical studies to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming. Clinical trials generally become larger and more costly to conduct as they advance into later stages and, in the future, we will be required to make estimates for expense accruals related to clinical trial expenses. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of any product candidates that we develop from our programs. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from sales of product candidates we develop, if at all. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing product candidates, including the uncertainty of: successful completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials; sufficiency of our financial and other resources to complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials; substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern; acceptance of INDs for our planned clinical trials or future clinical trials; successful enrollment and completion of clinical trials; successful data from our clinical program that support an acceptable risk-benefit profile of our product candidates in the intended populations; receipt and maintenance of regulatory and marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; scaleup of our manufacturing processes and formulation of our product candidates for later stages of development and commercialization; establishing our own manufacturing capabilities or agreements with third-party manufacturers for clinical supply for our clinical trials and commercial manufacturing, if our product candidate is approved; entry into collaborations to further the development of our product candidates; obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection or regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates; successfully launching commercial sales of our product candidates, if approved; acceptance of the product candidates benefits and uses, if approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors; the prevalence and severity of adverse events experienced with our product candidates; maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of the product candidates following approval; effectively competing with other therapies; obtaining and maintaining healthcare coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors; and qualifying for, maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property rights and claims.

 A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate, or if we experience significant delays in our clinical trials due to patient enrollment or other reasons, we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development. The following table summarizes our research and development expenses by product candidate or program (in thousands): 

Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Eseba-vec (formerly HB-200) program 11,099 10,862 40,488 31,310 HB-300 program 1,656 2,312 3,567 7,649 Gilead partnered programs 2,011 3,234 4,860 10,889 HB-700 HB-800 (formerly Roche partnered programs) 438 6,689 5,331 10,014 Other and earlier-stage programs (22) 1,122 502 4,215 Other unallocated research and development expenses 383 406 734 1,185 Total research and development expenses 15,565 24,625 55,482 65,262 Other unallocated research and development expenses include stock-based compensation expense, certain lease expenses and other operating expenses that we do not track on a program-by-program basis, since our research and development employees and infrastructure resources are utilized across our programs. General and Administrative Expenses Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs in our executive, finance and investor relations, business development and administrative functions. Other general and administrative expenses include consulting fees and professional service fees for auditing, tax and legal services, lease expenses related to our offices, premiums for directors and officers liability insurance, intellectual property costs incurred in connection with filing and prosecuting patent applications, depreciation and other costs. We expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in the future as we expand our operating activities and prepare for potential commercialization of our current and future product candidates, increase our headcount and investor relations activities and maintain compliance with requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Impairment Expenses Impairment expenses consist of non-cash impairment charges relating to long-lived assets. Impairments are determined using management s judgment about the anticipated performance of our business in relation to expectations, significant negative technological, scientific or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets and their effects based on information available as of the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Management makes decisions to disposes of fixed assets during the regular course of business due to damage, obsolescence, strategic shifts, and loss. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its estimated undiscounted net future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value.

 Restructuring Expenses Restructuring expenses consist of severance and other personnel costs and professional services and consulting costs associated with exit and disposal activities. Grant Income Since inception, we have received grants from the Austrian Research Promotions Agency, either under funding agreements or under research incentive programs. In addition, we have received loans under funding agreements that bear interest at below market interest rate. We account for the grants received as other income and for the imputed benefits arising from the difference between a market rate of interest and the rate of interest as additional grant income, and record interest expense for the loans at a market rate of interest. We participate in a research incentive program provided by the Austrian government under which we are entitled to reimbursement of a percentage of qualifying research and development expenses and capital expenditures incurred in Austria. Submissions for reimbursement under the program are submitted annually. Incentive amounts are generally paid out during the calendar year that follows the year of the expenses but remain subject to subsequent examinations by the responsible authority. Furthermore, we participated in the life sciences research and development program provided by the New York State government under which we were entitled to reimbursement of a percentage of qualifying research and development expenses in New York State up to 0.5 million per year for the years 2019 to 2021. Submissions for reimbursement under the program were submitted in the fourth quarter of 2023 and certificates of tax credits were received. Incentive amounts are generally paid out six to nine months after amended tax returns including a certificate of tax credit issued by Empire State Development are filed. We account for the grants received as other income. We also participate in the New York City biotechnology tax credit program, according to which certain expenses for business in the biotechnology field in New York City limited to 0.25 million per year for three consecutive years from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2025 are incentivized. We account for the grants received as other income. Interest Income Interest income results from interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. Interest Expense Interest expense results primarily from loans under funding agreements with the Austrian Research Promotion Agency, recorded at a market rate of interest. The difference between interest payments payable pursuant to the loans, which rates are at below market interest rates, and the market interest rate, is accounted for as grant income. Income Taxes Income tax expense results from U.S. federal and state income tax as well as foreign minimum income tax and profit on a legal entity basis. The losses that we have incurred since inception result primary from the losses of our Austrian subsidiary. We have considered that, at this point in time, it is uncertain whether we will ever be able to realize the benefits of the deferred tax asset, and accordingly, have established a full valuation allowance as of September 30, 2024.

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenue decreased by 2.2 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to no recognition of the upfront and milestone payments under the Roche Collaboration Agreement as a result of the termination of the Roche Collaboration Agreement, partially offset by revenue recognized for a 5.0 million milestone payment for the first person dosed in a Phase 1b clinical trial of HB-500 received in the three months ended September 30, 2024 under the Restated Gilead Collaboration Agreement. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, revenue included 0.3 million and 0.8 million, respectively, from reimbursement of research and development expenses, and 4.4 million and 6.1 million, respectively, from partial recognition of upfront, milestone and initiation payments that were initially recorded as deferred revenue. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenue included 4.7 million related to the Restated Gilead Collaboration Agreement, of which 0.3 million resulted from reimbursement of research and development expenses and 4.4 million resulted from partial recognition of milestone and initiation payments that were initially recorded as deferred revenue. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, revenue included 1.7 million related to the Restated Gilead Collaboration Agreement, of which 0.5 million resulted from reimbursement of research and development expenses and 1.2 million from partial recognition of milestone and initiation payments that were initially recorded as deferred revenue. In addition, revenue included 5.2 million related to the Roche Collaboration Agreement, of which 0.3 million

Table of Contents 
 resulted from reimbursement of expenses, and 4.9 million resulted from partial recognition of milestone and initiation payments that were initially recorded as deferred revenue. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue increased by 29.9 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to higher partial recognition of the upfront and milestone payments under the Roche Collaboration as a result of the termination of the Roche Collaboration Agreement leading to accelerated recognition of the upfront and milestone payments that were initially recorded as deferred revenue, including the partial recognition of revenue from a 10.0 million milestone achieved in March 2024 and revenue recognized for a 5.0 million milestone payment for the first person dosed in a Phase 1b clinical trial of HB-500 received in July 2024 under the Restated Gilead Collaboration Agreement. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, revenue included 0.6 million and 1.6 million, respectively, from reimbursement of research and development expenses, and 42.0 million and 11.1 million, respectively, from partial recognition of upfront, milestone and initiation payments that were initially recorded as deferred revenue. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue included 6.2 million related to the Restated Gilead Collaboration Agreement, of which 0.5 million resulted from reimbursement of research and development expenses and 5.7 million resulted from partial recognition of milestone and initiation payments that were initially recorded as deferred revenue. In addition, revenue included 36.4 million related to the terminated Roche Collaboration Agreement, of which 0.1 million resulted from reimbursement of expenses and 36.3 million resulted from revenue recognized. Revenue recognized includes 26.3 million of the upfront and milestone payments that were originally recorded as deferred revenue and 10.0 million related to a milestone payment achieved in March 2024 and received in April 2024 associated with an IND submission for the HB-700 program. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, revenue included 5.1 million related to the Restated Gilead Collaboration Agreement, of which 1.3 million resulted from reimbursement of research and development expenses and 3.8 million from partial recognition of milestone and initiation payments that were initially recorded as deferred revenue. In addition, revenue included 7.6 million from partial recognition of upfront and milestone payments under the terminated Roche Collaboration Agreement of which 0.3 million resulted from reimbursement of expenses, and 7.3 million resulted from partial recognition of milestone and initiation payments that were initially recorded as deferred revenue. Research and Development Expenses For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, research and development expenses were 15.6 million and 55.5 million, respectively, compared to 24.6 million and 65.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease of 9.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was attributable to a decrease in indirect research and development expenses of 2.2 million and a decrease in direct research and development expenses of 6.9 million. Indirect research and development expenses decreased mainly because of lower personnel-related expenses of 1.4 million, lower expenses for laboratory consumables of 0.4 million and lower expenses for consulting and professional services of 0.4 million. The decrease in personnel-related expenses mainly resulted from the effects of our workforce reduction, including the effects of stock option forfeitures. The decrease in direct research and development expenses was primarily driven by lower manufacturing expenses of 6.0 million, lower expenses for research and development services of 2.2 million, primarily for our Gilead partnered programs, and decreased spending for our other programs, partially offset by higher clinical study expenses of 1.3 million, primarily for our eseba-vec program. The decrease of 9.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was attributable to a decrease in indirect research and development expenses of 5.6 million and a decrease in direct research and development expenses of 4.2 million. Indirect research and development expenses decreased mainly because of lower personnel-related expenses of 3.5 million, lower expenses for laboratory 

 37

 consumables of 1.2 million and lower expenses for tavel, training and recruitment of 0.6 million. The decrease in personnel-related expenses mainly resulted from the effects of our workforce reduction, including the effects of stock option forfeitures. The decrease in direct research and development expenses was primarily driven by lower manufacturing expenses of 10.9 million, lower expenses for research and development services of 3.0 million, primarily for our eseba-vec program and Gilead partnered programs, and decreased spending for our other programs, partially offset by higher clinical study expenses of 7.3 million, primarily for our eseba-vec program, as well as amortization expenses related to capitalized sublicense payments following the termination of the Roche Collaboration of 2.4 million. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 6.7 million and 14.7 million, respectively, compared to 4.9 million and 14.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase of 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to an increase in personnel-related expenses of 1.3 million and an increase in professional and consulting fees of 0.6 million, partially offset by lower expenses for travel, training and recruitment of 0.1 million. The increase in personnel-related expenses resulted primarily from severance arrangements not related to the restructuring programs, and the increase in professional and consulting fees was primarily attributable to specialized organizational programs including related legal fees. The increase of 0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to an increase in personnel-related expenses of 0.6 million and an increase in professional and consulting fees of 0.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in other expenses of 0.3 million and lower expenses for tavel, training and recruitment of 0.2 million. The increase in personnel-related expenses resulted primarily from severance arrangement not related to the restructuring programs, partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expenses. The increase in professional and consulting fees was primarily attributable to specialized organizational programs including related legal fees. Restructuring Expenses Restructuring expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 0.9 million and 2.2 million, respectively. Restructuring expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of 0.8 million of severance and other personnel costs and less than 0.1 million of professional fees and consulting costs associated with exit and disposal activities. There were no restructuring expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Restructuring expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of 2.1 million of severance and other personnel costs and 0.1 million of professional fees and consulting costs associated with exit and disposal activities. There were no restructuring expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Impairment Expenses Impairment expenses for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 0.2 million. Impairment expenses for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of 0.2 million asset write-downs related to laboratory equipment. There were no impairment expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Grant Income In the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded grant income of 2.2 million, compared to 2.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Income from grants mainly included research incentives. The decrease of 0.7 million was primarily due to lower income from Austrian research and development incentives as a result of lower eligible research and development expenses, and lower imputed benefits associated with the FFG Loans. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded grant income of 6.9 million, compared to 7.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Income from grants mainly included research incentives and imputed benefits from below market interest rates on loans from governmental agencies. The decrease of 0.6 million was primarily due to lower income from Austrian research and development incentives as a result of lower eligible research and development expenses, and lower imputed benefits associated with the FFG Loans. Interest Income and Expense Interest income was 0.8 million and 3.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to interest income of 1.6 million and 4.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease in interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a result of a lower cash position and by decreasing U.S. dollar and euro interest rates. Interest income represents interest from cash and cash equivalents held in U.S. dollars and euros resulting from the proceeds from the issuance of common stock and convertible preferred stock as well as payments received under our Gilead and Roche collaborations. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were mainly held in dollars at U.S. investment grade financial institutions or in money market funds. In addition, smaller amounts were held in euros and dollars at our Austrian subsidiary. No interest expenses were recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to interest expenses for loans from government agencies of less than 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expenses for loans from government agencies were less than 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense was recorded at the market rate of interest, which exceeded the contractual interest rate. The decrease of interest expenses was primarily due to the final principal repayment related to the FFG Loans in the second quarter of 2024. Other Income and Expenses Other income was 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to other expenses of 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change in the three months ended September 30, 2024 resulted primarily from exchange rate differences and foreign currency remeasurements. Other income was 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to other expenses of 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted primarily from exchange rate differences and foreign currency remeasurements. Liquidity and Capital Resources Since our inception in 2011, we have funded our operations primarily from public offerings and private placements of common stock and convertible preferred stock, including our initial public offering, as well as private placements of our redeemable convertible preferred stock, grant funding and loans from an Austrian government agency, and upfront, milestone and initiation payments from Gilead and Roche in connection with research collaboration agreements. Prior to our IPO, we raised gross proceeds of approximately 142.5 million from the issuance of our redeemable convertible preferred stock. In April 2019, we completed our IPO in which we issued and sold 600,000 (6,000,000 before the Reverse Stock Split) shares of our common stock, at 140.00 per share, for gross proceeds of 84.0 million, or net proceeds of 74.6 million. In December 2020, we completed a follow-on public offering in which

 we issued 391,000 (3,910,000 before the Reverse Stock Split) shares of our common stock, at 117.50 per share, and 2,978 shares of our Series A convertible preferred stock, at 11,750.00 per share, for net proceeds of 75.0 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. In March 2022, we completed a follow-on public offering in which we issued 2,170,000 (21,700,000 before the Reverse Stock Split) shares of our common stock, at 20.00 per share, and 15,800 shares of our Series A-1 convertible preferred stock, at 2,000.00 per share, for net proceeds of 70.2 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. In June 2023, we completed a follow-on public offering in which we issued 2,290,077 (22,900,768 before the Reverse Stock Split) shares of our common stock, at 13.10 per share, and 15,268 shares of our Series A-2 convertible preferred stock, at 1,310.00 per share, for net proceeds of 46.2 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. In addition, in February 2022, Gilead purchased 166,666 (1,666,666 before the Reverse Stock Split) shares of our common stock for 5.0 million, at a purchase price of 30.00 per share, and in December 2023, Gilead purchased 1,500,000 (15,000,000 before the Reverse Stock Split) shares of our common stock, at 14.167 per share, for net proceeds of approximately 21.1 million after deducting offering expenses. Pursuant to the terms of the Amended Stock Purchase Agreement, we may require Gilead to purchase the balance of the 8.75 million of common stock as pro-rata participation in potential future equity raises (see Note 11. Common stock, Class A common stock and convertible preferred stock to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report). We also received 51.2 million from non-refundable upfront, milestone and initiation payments pursuant to the Restated Gilead Collaboration Agreement and 45.0 million from non-refundable upfront and milestone payments related to the Roche Collaboration Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of 60.0 million. On July 12, 2022, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 (the Registration Statement ), with the SEC, which was declared effective on July 21, 2022. The Registration Statement registers the offering, issuance and sale of an unspecified amount of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and/or units of any combination thereof. We simultaneously entered into a Sales Agreement with Leerink Partners LLC Leerink ), as sales agent, to provide for the issuance and sale by us of up to 50.0 million of common stock from time to time in at-the-market offerings under the Registration Statement and related prospectus filed with the Registration Statement Leerink ATM Program ). As of June 30, 2024, no sales had been made pursuant to the Leerink ATM Program. On August 5, 2024, we delivered a termination notice to Leerink to terminate the Sales Agreement, effective as of August 8, 2024. At the time of termination, 50.0 million remained available for issuance pursuant to the Sales Agreement. On August 8, 2024, we entered into an Open Market Sale Agreement SM with Jefferies LLC, as sales agent, to provide for the issuance and sale by us of up to 50.0 million of common stock from time to time in at-the-market offerings under the Registration Statement and related prospectus filed with the Registration Statement Jefferies ATM Program ). As of September 30, 2024, no sales had been made pursuant to the Jefferies ATM Program. We entered into various funding agreements with the Austrian Research Promotion Agency sterreichische Forschungsf rderungsgesellschaft, or FFG ). The loans by FFG (the FFG Loans were made on a project-by-project basis and bear interest at a rate of 0.75 per annum. In the event that the underlying program research results in a scientific or technical failure, the principal then outstanding under any loan may be forgiven by FFG and converted to non-repayable grant funding on a project-by-project basis. The FFG Loans contained no financial covenants and were not secured by any of our assets. As of September 30, 2024, there is no remaining debt obligation under the FFG loan following the final principal repayment in April 2024. Because the FFG Loans bear interest at below market rates we account for the imputed benefit arising from the difference between an estimated market rate of interest and the contractual interest rate as grant funding from FFG, which is included in grant income. On the date that FFG Loan proceeds are received, we recognize the portion of the loan proceeds allocated to grant funding as a discount to the carrying value of the loan and as unearned income. As of September 30, 2024, the unamortized debt discount related to FFG Loans was zero due to the final maturity on March 31, 2024 and the final repayment on April 2, 2024. We have entered into arrangements with contract manufacturing organizations. As of September 30, 2024, we had total non-cancellable obligations under such contracts of 5.9 million. We do not expect positive cash flows from operations in the foreseeable future, if at all. Historically, we have incurred operating losses as a result of ongoing efforts to develop our arenavirus technology platform and our product 

 40 

Table of Contents 
 candidates, including conducting ongoing research and development, preclinical studies, clinical trials, providing general and administrative support for these operations and developing our intellectual property portfolio. We expect to continue to incur net operating losses for at least the next several years as we progress clinical development, seek regulatory approval, prepare for and, if approved, proceed to commercialization of our most advanced oncology product candidate eseba-vec, continue our research and development efforts relating to our other and future product candidates, and invest in our manufacturing capabilities and our own manufacturing facility. Going Concern We evaluated whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the condensed consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are issued. This evaluation initially does not take into consideration the potential mitigating effect of management s plans that have not been fully implemented as of the date the financial statements are issued. When substantial doubt exists under this methodology, management evaluates whether the mitigating effect of its plans sufficiently alleviates substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The mitigating effect of management s plans, however, is only considered if both (1) it is probable that the plans will be effectively implemented within one year after the date that the condensed consolidated financial statements are issued, and (2) it is probable that the plans, when implemented, will mitigate the relevant conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. In performing its analysis, management excluded certain elements of its operating plan that cannot be considered probable. Under ASC 205-40, the future receipt of potential funding from future partnerships, equity or debt issuances, the potential milestones from the Gilead Collaboration Agreement and potential reductions in force cannot be considered probable at this time because these plans are not entirely within our control and/or have not been approved by the Board of Directors as of the date of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. Our expectation to generate operating losses and negative operating cash flows in the future and the need for additional funding to support our planned operations raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date that condensed consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are issued. Management's plans to alleviate the conditions that raise substantial doubt include reduced spending and the pursuit of additional capital. Management has concluded that the likelihood that its plan to successfully obtain sufficient funding, or adequately reduce expenditures, while reasonably possible, is less than probable. Accordingly, we have concluded that substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of issuance of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of the uncertainties described above. Future Funding Requirements We have no products approved for commercial sale. To date, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, undertaking preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates. As a result, we are not profitable and have incurred losses in each period since our inception in 2011, except for the first quarter of 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 387.8 million. We expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. Based on our cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 and our planned operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements, there is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the issuance date of 

 41 

Table of Contents 
 the condensed consolidated financial statements accompanying this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We anticipate that we will require additional funding to: pursue the clinical and preclinical development of our current and future product candidates; leverage our technologies to advance product candidates into preclinical and clinical development; seek regulatory approvals for product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, if any; attract, hire and retain additional clinical, quality control and scientific personnel; establish our manufacturing capabilities through third parties or by ourselves and scale-up manufacturing to provide adequate supply for clinical trials and commercialization; expand our operational, financial and management systems and increase personnel, including personnel to support our clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization efforts and our operations as a public company; expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; establish a sales, marketing, medical affairs and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain marketing approval and intend to commercialize on our own or jointly; acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies; and incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses in operating our business, including ongoing costs associated with operating as a public company. 
 Even if we succeed in commercializing one or more of our product candidates, we will continue to incur substantial research and development and other expenditures to develop and market additional product candidates. We may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of our expenses and our ability to generate revenue. Our prior losses and expected future losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders equity and working capital. We will require substantial additional financing and a failure to obtain this necessary capital could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development programs, commercialization efforts or other operations. Since our inception, we have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in research and development activities for our non-replicating and replicating technologies and our product candidates derived from these technologies. Preclinical studies and clinical trials and additional research and development activities will require substantial funds to complete. We believe that we will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future in connection with the development of our current product candidates and programs as well as any future product candidates we may choose to pursue, as well as the gradual gaining of control over our required manufacturing capabilities and other corporate uses. These expenditures will include costs associated with conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and manufacturing and supply, as well as marketing and selling any products approved for sale. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise. Because the outcome of any preclinical study or clinical trial is highly uncertain, we cannot reasonably estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of our current or future product candidates. 

 42 

Table of Contents 
 Our future capital requirements depend on many factors, including: the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing our current and future product candidates and programs, and of conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials; the number and development requirements of other product candidates that we may pursue, and other indications for our current product candidates that we may pursue; the stability, scale and yields of our future manufacturing process as we scale-up production and formulation of our product candidates for later stages of development and commercialization; the timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory and marketing approvals and developing our ability to establish sales and marketing capabilities, if any, for our current and future product candidates we develop if clinical trials are successful; the success of our collaboration with Gilead; our ability to establish and maintain collaborations, strategic licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements; the cost of commercialization activities for our current and future product candidates that we may develop, whether alone or with a collaborator; the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, expanding, defending and enforcing patent claims, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation; the timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or royalties on, our future products, if any; and the emergence of competing oncology and infectious disease therapies and other adverse market developments. 
 A change in the outcome of any of these or other variables with respect to the development of any of our current and future product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. Furthermore, our operating plans may change in the future, and we will need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements associated with such operating plans. We do not have any committed external source of funds or other support for our development efforts. Until we can generate sufficient product and royalty revenue to finance our cash requirements, which we may never do, we expect to finance our future cash needs through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements and other marketing or distribution arrangements as well as grant funding. Based on our research and development plans, we have concluded that substantial doubt exists that our cash and cash equivalents, including the funds received under the Restated Gilead Collaboration Agreement will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months from the issuance date of the condensed consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. These estimates are based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect. If we raise additional capital through marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish certain valuable rights to our product candidates, technologies, future revenue streams or research programs or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we raise additional capital through public or private equity offerings, the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our stockholders rights. Further, to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of common stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock, the ownership interest of our shareholders will be diluted. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, we would be 

 43 

Table of Contents 
 subject to fixed payment obligations and may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we are unable to obtain additional funding on favorable terms when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or terminate one or more of our research and development programs or clinical trials or our other operations. Cash Flows The following table sets forth a summary of the primary sources and uses of cash (in thousands): 

Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash used in operating activities (56,040) (46,300) Net cash used in investing activities (192) (3,737) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (1,276) 44,421 Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents (57,508) (5,616) Cash Used in Operating Activities During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was 56.0 million, which consisted of a net loss of 18.6 million, adjusted by non-cash charges of 3.4 million and cash used due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities of 40.8 million. The non-cash charges consisted primarily of depreciation and amortization expense of 2.1 million, stock-based compensation of 1.1 million and non-cash impairment charges of 0.2 million. The change in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a decrease in deferred revenues of 26.7 million, primarily resulting from the early-recognition of deferred revenues related to the terminated Roche Collaboration Agreement, partially offset by a 5.0 million milestone payment received under the Gilead Collaboration Agreement, an increase in prepaid expenses and other non-current assets of 5.9 million, an increase in receivable research incentives of 5.6 million, a decrease in accounts payable of 5.1 million, and a decrease in operating lease liabilities of 1.2 million, partially offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of 2.2 million, a decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of 0.9 million, and a decrease in accounts receivable of 0.6 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in operating activities was 46.3 million, which consisted of a net loss of 56.8 million, adjusted by non-cash charges of 4.2 million and cash provided due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities of 6.3 million. The non-cash charges consisted primarily of depreciation and amortization expense of 2.3 million and stock-based compensation of 1.9 million. The change in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable of 5.8 million, primarily resulting from the collection of a 5.0 million milestone payment and cost reimbursements from Gilead, an increase in accounts payable of 4.1 million, a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of 3.5 million, an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of 2.1 million, and an increase in other non-current liabilities of 0.2 million, partially offset by an increase in receivable research incentives of 7.2 million, a decrease in deferred revenues of 1.2 million, a decrease in operating lease liabilities of 0.8 million, and an increase in other non-current assets of 0.2 million. Cash Used in Investing Activities During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in investing activities was 0.2 million. The decrease of 3.5 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 resulted from deceased capital expenditures in connection with our GMP manufacturing facility project and lower expenditures for purchase of equipment. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in investing activities was 3.7 million and resulted primarily from capital expenditures in connection with our GMP manufacturing facility project as well as purchase of equipment.

Table of Contents 
 Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in financing activities was 1.3 million and consisted mainly of a principal repayment of loans of 1.1 million and costs related to Gilead s purchase of common stock in December 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash provided by financing activities was 44.4 million and consisted mainly of net proceeds of 46.3 million from our follow-on public offering in June 2023, partially offset by principal repayments of loans of 1.8 million. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements accompanying this Quarterly Report, which we have prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC and generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP ). The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our critical accounting policies and the methodologies and assumptions we apply under them have not materially changed, as compared to those disclosed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on March 22, 2024. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements A description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position and results of operations is disclosed in Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements appearing in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Emerging Growth Company Status and Smaller Reporting Company As an emerging growth company, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 allows us to delay adoption of new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies until such standards are made applicable to private companies. However, we have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. We are also a smaller reporting company meaning that the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700 million and our annual revenue was less than 100 million during our most recently completed fiscal year. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 250 million or (ii) our annual revenue was less than 100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700 million. If we are a smaller reporting company at the time we cease to be an emerging growth company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies. For so long as we 

 45 

Table of Contents 
 remain a smaller reporting company, we are permitted and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure and other requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not smaller reporting companies. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and inflation. All of these market risks arise in the ordinary course of business, as we do not engage in speculative trading activities. The following analysis provides additional information regarding these risks. Foreign Currency and Exchange Risk We are subject to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, specifically with respect to the euro. Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar and the functional currency of our wholly owned foreign subsidiary, HOOKIPA Biotech GmbH, is the euro. Our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as of September 30, 2024 included small amounts of cash balances held by HOOKIPA Biotech GmbH in euro. Assets and liabilities of HOOKIPA Biotech GmbH are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the balance sheet date. Income items and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate in effect during the period. Unrealized translation gains and losses are recorded as a cumulative translation adjustment, which is included in the condensed consolidated Statements of Convertible Preferred Stock and Stockholders Equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. Adjustments that arise from exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in a currency other than the local currency are included in other income and expenses, net in the condensed consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss as incurred. A significant portion of our operating costs are in Austria, which are denominated in the euro. This foreign currency exposure gives rise to market risk associated with exchange rate movements of the U.S. dollar against the euro. Furthermore, we anticipate that a significant portion of our expenses will continue to be denominated in the euro. A hypothetical 10 weakening of the U.S. dollar compared to the euro would have increased our net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, by approximately 1.1 million and increased our currency translation adjustment by approximately 3.1 million. A hypothetical 10 strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to the euro would have an equal and opposite effect on our financial statements. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. We had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of 60.0 million as of September 30, 2024, which included account balances with foreign banks. Interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates; however, due to the nature of these investments, we do not believe that we have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates. Impacts of Inflation While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we do not believe inflation has had a material effect on our historical results of operations and financial condition. However, inflation, has had, and may continue to have, an impact on the labor costs we incur to attract and retain qualified personnel, costs to conduct clinical trials and other operational costs. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset higher costs through raising funds or other corrective measures, and our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, increased inflation has had, and may continue to have, an effect on interest rates. Increased interest rates may adversely affect our borrowing rate and our ability to obtain, or the terms under which we can obtain, any potential additional funding. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a 15(e) and 15d 15(e) under the Exchange Act, refers to controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in 

 46 

Table of Contents 
 the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of September 30, 2024, management, with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objective and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a 15(f) and 15d 15(f) under the Exchange Act) identified that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings. From time to time, we may become involved in litigation or legal proceedings relating to claims arising in the ordinary course of business. Item 1A. Risk Factors. Our business is subject to risks and events that, if they occur, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our securities. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes from our risk factors described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our strategic refocus and the associated workforce reduction announced in January 2024 and additional workforce reduction implemented in September 2024 may not result in anticipated cost savings, could result in total costs and expenses that are greater than expected and could disrupt our business. In January 2024, we announced a reduction in workforce by approximately 30 in connection with the strategic refocus of our business to prioritize and focus on our lead assets. The reduction in force was a component of our broader efforts to prioritize the clinical development of our eseba-vec (formerly HB-200) program for the treatment of HPV16+ head and neck cancers and our two Gilead-partnered infectious disease programs and to pause development activities related to HB-300 and most of our preclinical research activities. In September 2024, in connection with this strategic refocus, we implemented an enterprise-wide initiative intended to improve our business through specialized 

 47 

Table of Contents 
 organizational programs that include targeted cost-savings, which included a further reduction in workforce by approximately 20 . Going forward, we may implement further cost-saving initiatives that could result in additional restructuring charges including severance and other employee charges. We may not realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits, savings and improvements in our operating structure from our restructuring efforts due to unforeseen difficulties, delays or unexpected costs. If we are unable to realize the expected operational efficiencies and cost savings from the restructuring, our results of operation and financial condition would be adversely affected. We expect to incur additional costs as we recognize one-time employee termination-related charges. Furthermore, our strategic restructuring plan may be disruptive to our operations. For example, our workforce reductions could yield unanticipated consequences, such as attrition beyond planned staff reductions, increased difficulties in our day-to-day operations and reduced employee morale. If employees who were not affected by the reduction in force seek alternate employment, this could result in us seeking contract support which may result in unplanned additional expense or harm our productivity. Our workforce reductions could also harm our ability to attract and retain qualified management, scientific, and clinical personnel who are critical to our business. Any failure to attract or retain qualified personnel could prevent us from successfully developing our product candidates in the future. We are highly dependent on our key personnel to grow our business, and if we are not successful in attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel, we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy. We are highly dependent on members of our executive team. Although we have formal employment agreements with our executive officers, any of our executive officers could leave our employment at any time, or within a contractual termination period that is too short to find an adequate replacement. We currently do not have key person insurance on any of our employees. The loss of the services of our executive officers or other key employees may adversely impact the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives and seriously harm our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. Any significant leadership change or senior management transition involves risk, especially nearly simultaneous changes involving senior level leadership positions. For example, on July 22, 2024, Joern Aldag separated as our Chief Executive Officer and Reinhard Kandera separated as our Chief Financial Officer. In addition, on July 22, 2024, Dr. Malte Peters was appointed as our Chief Executive Officer and Terry Coelho was appointed as our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Any failure to effectively transition these senior executive leadership changes or to retain Dr. Peters or Ms. Coelho on our executive team could hinder our strategic planning, business execution and future performance. Recruiting and retaining qualified employees, consultants and advisors for our business, including scientific and technical personnel, also will be critical to our success. We primarily conduct our operations at our facility in Vienna, Austria. This region is headquarters to many other biopharmaceutical companies and many academic and research institutions. Competition for skilled personnel is intense and the turnover rate can be high. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions for skilled individuals. In addition, failure to succeed in preclinical studies, clinical trials or applications for marketing approval may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified personnel. To induce valuable employees to join and remain at our company, in addition to salary and cash incentives, we have provided, and intend to continue to provide, stock options that vest over time. The value of these equity grants that vest over time to our employees may be significantly affected by movements in the fair market value of our capital stock that are beyond our control, and may at any time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies. Moreover, many of our employees have become or will soon become vested in a substantial amount of our common stock or a number of common stock options. Our employees may be more likely to leave us if the shares they own have significantly appreciated in value relative to the original purchase prices of the shares, or if the exercise prices of the options that they hold are significantly below the market price of our common stock. Accordingly, our future success depends on our ability to continue to attract and retain current and additional executive officers and other key employees. The inability to recruit, or the loss of services of certain executives, key employees, consultants or advisors, may impede the progress of our research, development and commercialization objectives and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

 There is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. We will need to raise substantial additional funding, which may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all, to be able to continue as a going concern and advance any our product candidates. Failure to obtain capital when needed may force us to delay, limit or terminate our product development efforts or other operations. Raising additional capital may dilute our existing shareholders, restrict our operations or cause us to relinquish valuable rights. There is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. Our continued existence is dependent upon our ability to obtain additional capital. As of December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of approximately 117.5 million and 60.0 million, respectively. Our management believes that such cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash will not be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital requirements for one year after the date that the financial statements are issued, whether or not we curtail efforts with respect to certain of our product candidates. We will require significant additional funding to advance any of our product candidates beyond the short term. We are seeking funds through collaborations, strategic alliances, or licensing arrangements with third parties, and such agreements may impact rights to our product candidates or technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or products candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. Such arrangements will limit our participation in the success of any of our product candidates that receive regulatory approval. We may also seek to raise such capital through public or private equity, royalty financing or debt financing. Raising funds in the current economic environment is challenging and financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms, if at all. The issuance of additional securities, whether equity or debt, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our shares to decline. The sale of additional equity or convertible securities may dilute the ownership of existing shareholders. Incurring debt would result in increased fixed payment obligations, and we may agree to restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt or limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights that could impede our ability to conduct our business. Item 5. Other Information. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, none of the Company s directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Securities Exchange Act) , or a trading arrangement or trading arrangement (as such terms are defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K).
