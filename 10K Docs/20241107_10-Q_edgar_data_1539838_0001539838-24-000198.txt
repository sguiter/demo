 Argus WTI Houston Grade of oil that serves as a benchmark price for oil at Houston, Texas. Argus WTI Midland Grade of oil that serves as a benchmark price for oil at Midland, Texas. Basin A large depression on the earth s surface in which sediments accumulate. Bbl or barrel One stock tank barrel, or 42 U.S. gallons liquid volume, used in this report in reference to crude oil or other liquid hydrocarbons. BO/d One barrel of crude oil per day. BOE One barrel of oil equivalent, with six thousand cubic feet of natural gas being equivalent to one barrel of oil. BOE/d BOE per day. Brent A major trading classification of light sweet oil that serves as a benchmark price for oil worldwide. Completion The process of treating a drilled well followed by the installation of permanent equipment for the production of natural gas or oil, or in the case of a dry hole, the reporting of abandonment to the appropriate agency. Henry Hub Natural gas gathering point that serves as a benchmark price for natural gas futures on the NYMEX. Horizontal wells Wells drilled directionally horizontal to allow for development of structures not reachable through traditional vertical drilling mechanisms. MBbl One thousand barrels of crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbons. MBOE One thousand BOE. MBOE/d One thousand BOE per day. Mcf One thousand cubic feet of natural gas. Mineral interests The interests in ownership of the resource and mineral rights, giving an owner the right to profit from the extracted resources. MMBtu One million British Thermal Units. MMcf Million cubic feet of natural gas. Net acres The sum of the fractional working interest owned in gross acres. Oil and natural gas properties Tracts of land consisting of properties to be developed for oil and natural gas resource extraction. Proved reserves The estimated quantities of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be commercially recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Reserves The estimated remaining quantities of oil and natural gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations. In addition, there must exist, or there must be a reasonable expectation that there will exist, the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production, installed means of delivering oil and natural gas or related substances to the market and all permits and financing required to implement the project. Reserves are not assigned to adjacent reservoirs isolated by major, potentially sealing, faults until those reservoirs are penetrated and evaluated as economically producible. Reserves should not be assigned to areas that are clearly separated from a known accumulation by a non-productive reservoir (i.e., absence of reservoir, structurally low reservoir or negative test results). Such areas may contain prospective resources (i.e., potentially recoverable resources from undiscovered accumulations). Reservoir A porous and permeable underground formation containing a natural accumulation of producible natural gas and/or crude oil that is confined by impermeable rock or water barriers and is separate from other reservoirs. Royalty interest An interest that gives an owner the right to receive a portion of the resources or revenues without having to carry any costs of development, which may be subject to expiration. Waha Hub Natural gas gathering point that serves as a benchmark price for natural gas at western Texas and New Mexico. Working interest An operating interest that gives the owner the right to drill, produce and conduct operating activities on the property and receive a share of production and requires the owner to pay a share of the costs of drilling and production operations. WTI West Texas Intermediate, a light sweet blend of oil produced from fields in western Texas and is a grade of oil that serves as a benchmark for oil on the NYMEX.

When used in this report, the words aim, anticipate, believe, continue, could, estimate, expect, forecast, future, guidance, intend, may, model, outlook, plan, positioned, potential, predict, project, seek, should, target, will, would, and similar expressions (including the negative of such terms) as they relate to the Company are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain such identifying words. In particular, the factors discussed in this report and detailed under Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this report and our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2023 could affect our actual results and cause our actual results to differ materially from expectations, estimates or assumptions expressed, forecasted or implied in such forward-looking statements. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to we, us, our or the Company are intended to mean the business and operations of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 
 Factors that could cause our outcomes to differ materially include (but are not limited to) the following: 
 
 changes in supply and demand levels for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, and the resulting impact on the price for those commodities; 
 the impact of public health crises, including epidemic or pandemic diseases and any related company or government policies or actions; 
 actions taken by the members of OPEC and Russia affecting the production and pricing of oil, as well as other domestic and global political, economic, or diplomatic developments; 
 changes in general economic, business or industry conditions, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and inflation rates, instability in the financial sector; 
 regional supply and demand factors, including delays, curtailment delays or interruptions of production, or governmental orders, rules or regulations that impose production limits; 
 federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing, including the effect of existing and future laws and governmental regulations;

 restrictions on the use of water, including limits on the use of produced water and a moratorium on new produced water well permits recently imposed by the Texas Railroad Commission in an effort to control induced seismicity in the Permian Basin; 
 significant declines in prices for oil, natural gas, or natural gas liquids, which could require recognition of significant impairment charges; 
 changes in U.S. energy, environmental, monetary and trade policies; 
 conditions in the capital, financial and credit markets, including the availability and pricing of capital for drilling and development operations and our environmental and social responsibility projects; 
 challenges with employee retention and an increasingly competitive labor market;

 other risks and factors disclosed or incorporated by reference in this report. 
 
 In light of these factors, the events anticipated by our forward-looking statements may not occur at the time anticipated or at all. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment and new risks emerge from time to time. We cannot predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by any forward-looking statements we may make. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements made in this report.

At the time of the Conversion, Viper was a controlled company under the Nasdaq rules as the Company owned more than 50 of the voting power of Viper s common stock. 
 
 reportable segment, the upstream segment. 
 
 On October 31, 2023, pursuant to a common unit purchase and sale agreement entered into on September 4, 2023, Viper issued approximately million of its common units, which were converted to shares of Viper Class A common stock at the time of the Viper Conversion, to the Company at a price of per unit for total consideration to Viper of approximately million. On March 5, 2024, the Company exercised certain of its demand rights, pursuant to a registration rights agreement initially entered into on June 23, 2014, as amended and restated on May 9, 2018 and November 10, 2023, and on March 8, 2024, completed a public offering of approximately million of Viper s Class A common stock at a price of per share for proceeds, net of underwriters discount, of approximately million. After this offering, the Company owned less than of Viper s combined outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock, resulting in Viper no longer being a controlled company under the Nasdaq rules. As of September 30, 2024, following the completion of the Viper 2024 Equity Offering (as defined and discussed in Note 10 Stockholders' Equity and Earnings (Loss) Per Share the Company s ownership of Viper s voting securities was further reduced to approximately . However, the Company determined, in each case, that it still controls the activities of Viper in accordance with the guidance for variable interest entities in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 810 Consolidation ASC 810 and therefore continues to consolidate Viper in the Company s financial statements at September 30, 2024. See further discussion of the Company s determination that Viper is a variable interest entity VIE in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . The results of operations attributable to the non-controlling interest in Viper are presented within equity and net income and are shown separately from the equity and net income attributable to the Company. 
 
 These condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. They reflect all adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the results for interim periods, on a basis consistent with the annual audited financial statements. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. Certain information, accounting policies and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been omitted pursuant to SEC rules and regulations, although the Company believes the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. This Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q should be read in conjunction with the Company s most recent Annual Report on Form 10 K for the

in March 2024, the Company re-evaluated whether Viper should continue to be consolidated in the Company s financial statements. Viper meets the definition of a VIE under ASC 810 and the Company continues to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE through its ability, via existing contractual agreements, to direct the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of Viper. The Company also has the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits that could be significant to Viper. As such, the Company will continue to consolidate the activity of Viper. The Viper 2024 Equity Offering (as defined and discussed in Note 10 Stockholders' Equity and Earnings (Loss) Per Share was not determined to be an event that would cause the Company to change its conclusion regarding Viper s status as a VIE. 
 
 Viper maintains its own capital structure that is separate from the Company. The Company is not under any obligation to provide additional financial support or investment to Viper. Viper s assets cannot be used by the Company for general corporate purposes, and the creditors of Viper s liabilities do not have recourse to the Company s assets. The assets and liabilities of Viper are included in the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets and disclosed parenthetically, if material.

 receive-fixed, pay variable interest rate swap agreements for notional amounts of million which are considered economic hedges of the Company s billion fixed rate senior notes due 2029 (the 2029 Notes ). During the third quarter, the Company terminated and settled million of the notional amount of interest rate swaps for a loss of million recognized in the caption Gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net on the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. As a result of the partial termination, the Company has interest rate swap agreements for a notional amount of million at September 30, 2024. The Company receives a fixed rate of interest on these swaps and pays the variable rate of SOFR plus . The interest rate swaps are not treated as hedges for accounting purposes and, as a result, changes in fair value are recorded in earnings under the caption Gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 The interest rate swaps were designated as fair value hedges at inception, but the Company subsequently elected to discontinue hedge accounting. The cumulative fair value basis adjustment recorded at the time of dedesignation is being amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the 2029 Notes utilizing the effective interest method. See Note 9 Debt for further details. 
 
 Treasury Locks 
 
 During the second quarter of 2024, the Company entered into certain treasury lock contracts to reduce the forecasted interest rate risk associated with the issuance of the April 2024 Notes. The treasury locks were terminated and settled upon issuance of the April 2024 Notes with a loss of million recognized in the caption Gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net on the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Balance Sheet Offsetting of Derivative Assets and Liabilities 
 
 The fair value of derivative instruments is generally determined using established index prices and other sources which are based upon, among other things, futures prices and time to maturity. These fair values are recorded by netting asset and liability positions, including any deferred premiums that are with the same counterparty and are subject to contractual terms which provide for net settlement. See Note 14 Fair Value Measurements for further details.

 Assets and Liabilities Not Recorded at Fair Value 

The fair values of the Company s credit agreement and the Viper credit agreement approximate their carrying values based on borrowing rates available to the Company for bank loans with similar terms and maturities and are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair values of the outstanding notes were determined using the quoted market price at each period end, a Level 1 classification in the fair value hierarchy. 
 
 Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
 
 Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in certain circumstances. These assets and liabilities can include those acquired in a business combination, inventory, proved and unproved oil and gas properties, equity method investments, asset retirement obligations and other long-lived assets that are written down to fair value when they are impaired or held for sale. Refer to Note 4 Acquisitions and Divestitures , Note 5 Endeavor Energy Resources, LP Acquisition and Note 6 Property and Equipment for additional discussion of nonrecurring fair value adjustments. 
 
 Fair Value of Financial Assets 
 
 The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, prepaid expenses and other current assets, payables, other accrued liabilities and funds held in escrow approximate their fair value because of the short-term nature of the instruments.

Commodity Prices 
 
 Prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions. Regional and worldwide economic activity, extreme weather conditions and other substantially variable factors influence market conditions for these products. These factors are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. During the nine months ended 2024 and 2023, WTI prices averaged 77.61 and 77.28 per Bbl, respectively, and Henry Hub prices averaged 2.22 and 2.58 per MMBtu, respectively. 
 
 For additional information around risks related to commodity prices, see Part II. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Commodity Price Risk . 

Upstream Operations 
 
 Our activities are primarily directed at the horizontal development of the Wolfcamp and Spraberry formations in the Midland Basin and the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring formations in the Delaware Basin within the Permian Basin. Additionally, our publicly-traded subsidiary, Viper, is focused on owning and acquiring mineral interests and royalty interests in oil and natural gas properties primarily in the Permian Basin and derives royalty income and lease bonus income from such interests. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 870,303 net acres, which primarily consisted of approximately 715,956 net acres in the Midland Basin and 154,026 net acres in the Delaware Basin.

 As of September 30, 2024, we held interests in 28,920 gross (7,774 net) wells, including 2,051 gross (267 net) wells in which we have a non-operated working interest. 

Guidance 
 
 We expect production and capital expenditures to increase in the fourth quarter of 2024 due to the Endeavor Acquisition and to a lesser extent the Viper Q M Acquisitions and the Viper TWR Acquisition. Well performance continues to meet or exceed expectations in our core Midland Basin position, which we believe will allow us to continue to execute on our plan and achieve additional capital efficiency gains.

 Results of Operations 
 Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 
 
 As noted in Commodity Prices , the markets for oil and natural gas are highly volatile and are influenced by a number of factors which can lead to significant changes in our results of operations and management s operational strategy on a quarterly basis. Accordingly, our results of operations discussion focuses on a comparison of the current quarter s results of operations with those of the immediately preceding quarter. We believe our discussion provides investors with a more meaningful analysis of material operational and financial changes which occurred during the quarter based on current market and operational trends. 
 
 The following table sets forth selected operating data for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024:

 Oil, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids Revenues. Our revenues are a function of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production volumes sold and average sales prices received for those volumes. 
 
 Our oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues for the third quarter of 2024 increased by 180 million to 2.4 billion compared to the second quarter of 2024. The net increase was due to an additional 395 million attributable to the 22 increase in our combined volumes sold due primarily to the Endeavor Acquisition, which was partially offset by a 215 million decrease attributable to lower average prices received primarily for our oil, and to a lesser extent our natural gas and natural gas liquids production. 
 
 Net Sales of Purchased Oil . We have entered into purchase transactions and separate sales transactions with third parties to satisfy certain of our unused oil pipeline capacity commitments. The following table presents the net sales of purchased oil from third parties for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024:

 Oil, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids Revenues. Our revenues are a function of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production volumes sold and average sales prices received for those volumes. 
 
 Our oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 566 million, or 9 , to 6.6 billion from the same period in 2023 primarily due to an increase of 766 million attributable to the 14 growth in our combined volumes, which was partially offset by a 200 million net decrease attributable to lower average prices received for our natural gas and natural gas liquids production. 
 
 Approximately 47 of the increase in production is attributable to the Endeavor Acquisition and 14 is attributable to Viper s GRP Acquisition. The remainder of the production growth comes from new wells added between periods. 
 
 Net Sales of Purchased Oil . Beginning in the third quarter of 2023, we entered into purchase transactions and separate sale transactions with third parties to satisfy certain of our unused oil pipeline capacity commitments. The following table presents the net sales of purchased oil from third parties for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (In millions) 2024 2023 Sales of purchased oil 698 59 Purchased oil expense 696 59 Net sales of purchased oil 2 
 
 Other Revenues. The following table shows the other insignificant revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (In millions) 2024 2023 Other operating income 28 62 
 
 The decrease in other operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily resulted from a reduction in revenue from midstream services due to the sale of the Deep Blue Water Assets in the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Lease Operating Expenses. The following table shows lease operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (In millions, except per BOE amounts) Amount Per BOE Amount Per BOE Lease operating expenses 825 5.99 618 5.11 
 
 Lease operating expenses increased in total and on a per BOE basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to (i) 74 million of additional costs incurred for water services as a result of divesting the Deep Blue Water Assets in the third quarter of 2023, (ii) 46 million due to an increase in legacy production volumes, (iii) a 38 million increase attributable to wells acquired as part of the Endeavor Acquisition, (iv) a 30 million increase in workover expense, (v) 14 million in increased spend on electrical generation, and (vi) other individually insignificant changes.

 In general, production taxes are directly related to production revenues and are based upon current year commodity prices. Production taxes as a percentage of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenue for the 2024 period decreased compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to a refund of 17 million received for settlement of an audit in the first quarter of 2024. 
 
 Ad valorem taxes are based, among other factors, on property values driven by prior year commodity prices. Ad valorem taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 decreased by 15 million, primarily due to a reduction in our expected ad valorem tax rates for 2024 compared to the expected rates during the nine months ended 2023. 
 
 Gathering, Processing and Transportation Expense. The following table shows gathering, processing and transportation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (In millions, except per BOE amounts) Amount Per BOE Amount Per BOE Gathering, processing and transportation 261 1.90 209 1.73 
 
 The increase in gathering, processing and transportation expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 is attributable to (i) a 29 million increase from the growth in production volumes discussed above, and (ii) a 17 million increase due to contractual pricing increases on our gathering, processing and transportation costs, and (iii) an additional 5 million in shortfall penalties related to certain minimum volume commitments. 
 
 Depreciation, Depletion, Amortization and Accretion. The following table provides the components of our depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 See Note 5 Endeavor Energy Resources, LP Acquisition of the condensed notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding the Endeavor Acquisition. 
 
 The decrease in other operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily resulted from a 74 million reduction in midstream services costs due primarily to the sale of the Deep Blue Water Assets in the third quarter of 2023. This reduction was partially offset by a 22 million loss on the sale of property, plant and equipment in 2024 and other individually insignificant changes. 
 
 Derivative Instruments. The following table shows the net gain (loss) on derivative instruments and the net cash receipts (payments) on settlements of derivative instruments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 The change from a loss to a gain on derivative instruments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily reflects an increase in the value of both our natural gas and oil contracts due to a decrease in market prices for natural gas and oil compared to our contract prices and an increase in the value of our interest rate swap contracts primarily due to a decrease in future SOFR rates and the early termination of 300 million of the notional value of the interest rate swap contracts in 2024. See Note 13 Derivatives of the condensed notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding our derivative instruments.

 Interest expense, net decreased 29 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease primarily consisted of (i) an increase in interest income of 142 million due to holding funds raised for the Endeavor Acquisition in cash in short-term interest bearing accounts, which reduces interest expense, (ii) an additional 66 million in capitalized interest costs, which reduce interest expense, and (iii) a decrease of 13 million in interest expense on our revolving credit facility due to lower average borrowings outstanding in 2024. These reductions were largely offset by (i) an increase of 156 million in interest expense on senior notes related primarily to the issuance of the April 2024 Notes and Viper s 7.375 Senior Notes which were issued in the fourth quarter of 2023, and (ii) an increase of 35 million in amortization of debt issuance costs primarily related to our Bridge Facility, Term Loan Agreement and April 2024 Notes. 
 
 See Note 9 Debt of the condensed notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding outstanding borrowings. 
 
 Other income (expense), net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes a gain recorded on the WTG Midstream Transaction of approximately 76 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 including a 53 million gain on the sale of our equity method investment in Gray Oak as discussed further in Note 4 Acquisitions and Divestitures to the condensed notes to the consolidated financial statements.

 Nine Months Ended September 30, (In millions) 2024 2023 Provision for (benefit from) income taxes 685 648 
 
 The change in our income tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to the increase in pre-tax income resulting largely from higher revenues from oil and natural gas liquids, along with changes in operating expenses and other income (expenses) as discussed above. See Note 12 Income Taxes of the condensed notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our income tax expense. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Overview of Sources and Uses of Cash 
 
 Historically, our primary sources of liquidity have included cash flows from operations, proceeds from our public equity offerings, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, proceeds from the issuance of senior notes and sales of non-core assets. Our primary uses of capital have been for the acquisition, development and exploration of oil and natural gas properties, repayment of debt and returning capital to stockholders. At September 30, 2024, we had approximately 2.6 billion of liquidity consisting of 201 million in standalone cash and cash equivalents and 2.4 billion available under our credit facility. As of September 30, 2024, we have approximately 1.0 billion of Tranche A Loans maturing in the next 12 months. 
 
 Future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including the level of oil and natural gas production and volatility of commodity prices. Further, significant additional capital expenditures will be required to more fully develop our properties. Prices for our commodities are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions, regional and worldwide economic activity, weather and other substantially variable factors. These factors are beyond our control and are difficult to predict as discussed further in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. In order to mitigate this volatility, we enter into derivative contracts with a number of financial institutions, all of which are participants in our credit facility, to economically hedge a portion of our estimated future crude oil and natural gas production as discussed further in Note 13 Derivatives of the condensed notes to the consolidated financial statements and Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Commodity Price Risk . The level of our hedging activity 
 46 

Table of Contents 

 and duration of the financial instruments employed depend on our desired cash flow protection, available hedge prices, the magnitude of our capital program and our operating strategy. 

Cash Flow 
 
 Our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are presented below: 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (In millions) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 4,072 4,296 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (9,366) (1,859) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 5,082 (1,771) Net increase (decrease) in cash (212) 666 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 The decrease in operating cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily resulted from (i) an increase in our cash operating expenses, excluding purchased oil expense, of approximately 489 million related primarily to merger and integration costs incurred in the Endeavor Acquisition and additional lease operating expenses, (ii) a reduction of approximately 408 million due to fluctuations in other working capital balances due primarily to the timing of when collections were made on accounts receivable, payments made on accounts payable and the payment of accrued capital expenditures acquired from Endeavor, and (iii) an increase of 46 million in cash paid for interest, net of capitalized interest. These were partially offset by (i) an increase of 532 million in total revenue, excluding sales of purchased oil, (ii) an additional 142 million in interest income, and (iii) a reduction of 26 million in cash paid on settlements of derivatives. See Results of Operations for discussion of significant changes in our revenues and expenses. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 The majority of our net cash used for investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was for the acquisition of properties and equipment including the Endeavor Acquisition in the third quarter of 2024 and the Lario Acquisition in the first quarter of 2023 as well as drilling and completion costs incurred in conjunction with our development program. 
 
 Capital Expenditure Activities 
 
 Our capital expenditures excluding acquisitions and equity method investments (on a cash basis) were as follows for the specified period: 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (In millions) Drilling, completions and non-operated additions to oil and natural gas properties (1) 
 1,798 1,826 Infrastructure additions to oil and natural gas properties 128 122 Additions to midstream assets 8 104 Total 1,934 2,052 
 (1) See Transactions and Recent Developments Upstream Operations above for additional detail on wells drilled and turned to production during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to 5.5 billion of proceeds from the issuance of the April 2024 Notes, 1.0 billion in borrowings under the Tranche A Loans, 476 million in proceeds from the Viper 2024 Equity Offering and 451 million in proceeds from the sale of our shares of Viper s Class A common stock. These cash inflows were partially offset by (i) 1.3 billion of dividends paid to stockholders, (ii) 557 million of repurchases as part of the share repurchase program, (iii) 157 million in dividends paid to non-controlling interest, (iv) 148 million in repayments on our credit facilities, net of borrowings, (v) 95 million of debt issuance costs 
 47 

Table of Contents 

 primarily associated with the April 2024 Notes, Term Loan Agreement and Bridge Facility, and (vi) 37 million in cash paid for tax withholdings on vested employee stock awards. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to (i) 776 million of repurchases as part of the share and unit repurchase programs, (ii) 841 million of dividends paid to stockholders, (iii) 134 million paid for the retirement of principal outstanding on certain senior notes, and (iv) 84 million in distributions to non-controlling interest. These cash outflows were partially offset by an additional 98 million in borrowings under credit facilities, net of repayments. 

Capital Resources 
 
 Our working capital requirements are primarily supported by our cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We may draw on our revolving credit facility to meet short-term cash requirements, or issue debt or equity securities as part of our longer-term liquidity and capital management program. In September, we received an upgrade from two of the three major ratings agencies in the U.S., as Standard and Poor s Global Ratings Services upgraded us to BBB from BBB- and Fitch Investor Services upgraded us to BBB+ from BBB. Because of the alternatives available to us, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity are adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term capital requirements. 
 
 As we pursue our business and financial strategy, we regularly consider which capital resources, including cash flow and equity and debt financings, are available to meet our future financial obligations, planned capital expenditure activities and liquidity requirements. Our future ability to grow proved reserves and production will be highly dependent on the capital resources available to us. Any prolonged volatility in the capital, financial and/or credit markets and/or adverse macroeconomic conditions may limit our access to, or increase our cost of, capital or make capital unavailable on terms acceptable to us or at all.

 As of September 30, 2024, our debt, including the debt of Viper, consisted of approximately 12.0 billion in aggregate outstanding principal amount of senior notes, 1.0 billion in aggregate outstanding borrowings under the Tranche A Loans of our Term Loan Agreement and 115 million in aggregate outstanding borrowings under revolving credit facilities. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the maximum credit amount available under our credit agreement was 2.5 billion, with 115 million of outstanding borrowings and 2.4 billion available for future borrowings. Our credit agreement matures on June 2, 2028, and we have a further one-year extension available pursuant to the terms set forth in the credit agreement. 
 
 On August 2, 2024, we terminated our undrawn Tranche B Loans under the Term Loan Agreement. 
 
 Viper LLC s Credit Agreement 
 
 The Viper LLC credit agreement, as amended, matures on September 22, 2028 and provides for a revolving credit facility in the maximum credit amount of 2.0 billion, with a borrowing base of 1.3 billion and an elected commitment amount of 850 million, based on Viper LLC s oil and natural gas reserves and other factors. As of September 30, 2024, the Viper LLC credit agreement had no outstanding borrowings and 850 million available for future borrowings. 
 
 On October 1, 2024, Viper completed the Viper TWR Acquisition as discussed in Note 17 Subsequent Events of the condensed notes to the consolidated financial statements. Approximately 280 million of the cash consideration for this transaction was funded through borrowings under the Viper LLC credit agreement, reducing the amount that remained available for future borrowings under this facility to 570 million as of October 1, 2024. 
 
 For additional discussion of our debt as of September 30, 2024, see Note 9 Debt of the condensed notes to the consolidated financial statements. 

Capital Requirements 
 
 In addition to future operating expenses and working capital commitments discussed in Transactions and Recent Developments Upstream Operations our primary short and long-term liquidity requirements, excluding those of Viper, consist primarily of (i) capital expenditures, (ii) payments of principal and interest on our revolving credit agreements, Tranche A Loans and senior notes, (iii) payments of other contractual obligations, and (iv) cash used to pay for dividends and repurchases of securities.

2024 Capital Spending Plan 
 
 Our board of directors has approved an increase to our 2024 capital budget for drilling, midstream, infrastructure and environmental expenditures, which takes into account the Endeavor Acquisition. Our revised capital budget for the full year 2024 is approximately 2.88 billion to 3.00 billion and for the fourth quarter 2024 is approximately 950 million to 1.05 billion. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we estimate we will drill 105 to 125 gross (100 to 118 net) horizontal wells and complete 110 to 130 gross (102 to 120 net) horizontal wells across our operated and non-operated leasehold acreage in the Northern Midland and Southern Delaware Basins. 
 
 The amount and timing of our capital expenditures are largely discretionary and within our control. We could choose to defer a portion of these planned capital expenditures depending on a variety of factors, including but not limited to the success of our drilling activities, prevailing and anticipated prices for oil and natural gas, the availability of necessary equipment, infrastructure and capital, the receipt and timing of required regulatory permits and approvals, seasonal conditions, drilling and acquisition costs and the level of participation by other interest owners. We are currently operating 20 drilling rigs and five completion crews. We will continue monitoring commodity prices and overall market conditions and can adjust our rig cadence and our capital expenditure budget in response to changes in commodity prices and overall market conditions. 
 
 Interest on April 2024 Notes 
 
 On April 18, 2024, we issued 5.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of the April 2024 Notes, as discussed further in Note 9 Debt . As a result, we expect to incur additional future cash interest costs on the April 2024 Notes of approximately 130 million in 2024, 607 million cumulatively in the years from 2025 through 2026, 541 million cumulatively in the years from 2027 and 2028, and 4.7 billion cumulatively between 2029 and 2064. 
 
 Return of Capital Commitment 
 
 Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, our board of directors has approved a return of capital commitment of at least 50 (down from 75 of free cash flow to our stockholders through repurchases under our share repurchase program, base dividends and variable dividends. The remainder of our free cash flow will be used primarily to reduce debt. On October 31, 2024, our board of directors declared a base cash dividend for the third quarter of 2024 of 0.90 per share of common stock. 
 
 Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. As used by us, free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operating activities before changes in working capital in excess of cash capital expenditures and other adjustments as determined by us. We believe that free cash flow is useful to investors as it provides a measure to compare both cash flow from operating activities and additions to oil and natural gas properties across periods on a consistent basis. 
 
 On September 18, 2024, our board of directors approved an increase in our common stock repurchase program from 4.0 billion to 6.0 billion, excluding excise tax. Since the inception of the stock repurchase program, we repurchased an aggregate of 23.3 million shares of our common stock for a total cost of 3.1 billion, excluding excise tax, as of November 1, 2024. Subject to regulatory restrictions and other factors discussed elsewhere in this report, we intend to continue to purchase shares under this repurchase program opportunistically with available funds primarily from cash flow from operations and liquidity events such as the sale of assets while maintaining sufficient liquidity to fund our capital expenditure programs, however, the stock repurchase program is at the discretion of our board of directors and can be amended, terminated or suspended at any time. See Note 10 Stockholders' Equity and Earnings (Loss) Per Share of the condensed notes to the consolidated financial statements. 

Guarantor Financial Information 
 
 Diamondback E P is the sole guarantor under the indentures governing the outstanding Guaranteed Senior Notes. 
 
 Guarantees are full and unconditional, as that term is used in Regulation S-X, Rule 3-10(b)(3), except that such guarantees will be released or terminated in certain circumstances set forth in the indentures governing the Guaranteed Senior Notes, such as, with certain exceptions, (i) in the event Diamondback E P (or all or substantially all of its assets) is sold or disposed of, (ii) in the event Diamondback E P ceases to be a guarantor of or otherwise be an obligor under certain other indebtedness, and (iii) in connection with any covenant defeasance, legal defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the relevant indenture. 
 
 Diamondback E P s guarantees of the Guaranteed Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any of its future subordinated indebtedness, equal in right of payment with all of its existing and future senior indebtedness, including its obligations under its revolving credit facility, and effectively subordinated to any of its existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. 
 49 

Table of Contents 

The rights of holders of the Guaranteed Senior Notes against Diamondback E P may be limited under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or state fraudulent transfer or conveyance law. Each guarantee contains a provision intended to limit Diamondback E P s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent conveyance. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of Diamondback E P. Moreover, this provision may not be effective to protect the guarantee from being voided under fraudulent conveyance laws. There is a possibility that the entire guarantee may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. 
 
 The following tables present summarized financial information for Diamondback Energy, Inc., as the parent, and Diamondback E P, as the guarantor subsidiary, on a combined basis after elimination of (i) intercompany transactions and balances between the parent and the guarantor subsidiary, and (ii) equity in earnings from and investments in any subsidiary that is a non-guarantor. The information is presented in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13-01 under the SEC s Regulation S-X. The financial information may not necessarily be indicative of results of operations or financial position had the guarantor subsidiary operated as an independent entity.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 
 Our major market risk exposure in our exploration and production business is in the pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production. Realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to our natural gas production. Pricing for oil and natural gas production can be volatile and unpredictable. We cannot predict events, including the outcome of the war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war along with other conflicts in the Middle East, changes in interest rates and inflation and global supply chain disruptions that may lead to future price volatility. We cannot predict events that may lead to future price volatility and the near term energy outlook remains subject to heightened levels of uncertainty. Further, the prices we receive for production depend on many other factors outside of our control. 
 
 50 

Table of Contents 

 We use derivatives, including swaps, basis swaps, roll swaps, costless collars, puts and basis puts, to reduce price volatility associated with certain of our oil and natural gas sales. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had a net asset derivative position of 77 million related to our commodity price risk derivatives. Utilizing actual derivative contractual volumes under our commodity price derivatives as of September 30, 2024, a 10 increase in forward curves associated with the underlying commodity would have decreased the net asset position by 39 million to 38 million, while a 10 decrease in forward curves associated with the underlying commodity would have increased the net asset position by 78 million to 155 million. However, any cash derivative gain or loss would be substantially offset by a decrease or increase, respectively, in the actual sales value of production covered by the derivative instrument. For additional information on our open commodity derivative instruments at September 30, 2024, see Note 13 Derivatives of the condensed notes to the consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Counterparty and Customer Credit Risk 
 
 Our principal exposures to credit risk are due to the concentration of receivables from the sale of our oil and natural gas production (approximately 1,197 million at September 30, 2024), and to a lesser extent, receivables resulting from joint interest and other receivables (approximately 142 million at September 30, 2024). 
 
 We do not require our customers to post collateral, and the failure or inability of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us due to their liquidity issues, bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial results. 
 
 Joint operations receivables arise from billings to entities that own partial interests in the wells we operate. These entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we intend to drill. We have little ability to control whether these entities will participate in our wells. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 We are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates on our indebtedness under our revolving credit facilities, Tranche A Loans and changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt. Outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a per annum rate elected by Diamondback E P. At September 30, 2024, the applicable margin ranges from 0.125 to 1.000 per annum in the case of the alternate base rate, and from 1.125 to 2.000 per annum in the case of Adjusted Term SOFR, in each case based on the pricing level for both our revolving credit facilities and Tranche A Loans. The pricing level depends on certain rating agencies ratings of our long-term senior unsecured debt. We are obligated to pay a quarterly commitment fee ranging from 0.125 to 0.325 per year on the unused portion of the commitment for our revolving credit facilities. For our Tranche A Loans, we are obligated to pay a quarterly commitment fee equal to 0.125 per year on the aggregate principal amount of the commitments. We believe significant interest rate changes would not have a material near-term impact on our future earnings or cash flows. For additional information on our variable interest rate debt at September 30, 2024, see Note 9 Debt of the condensed notes to the consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Historically, we have at times used interest rates swaps to manage our exposure to (i) interest rate changes on our floating-rate date, and (ii) fair value changes on our fixed rate debt. At September 30, 2024, we have interest rate swap agreements for a notional amount of 900 million to manage the impact of changes to the fair value of our fixed rate senior notes due to changes in market interest rates through December 2029. We pay an average variable rate of interest for these swaps based on three month SOFR plus 2.1865 and receive a fixed interest rate of 3.50 from our counterparties. At September 30, 2024, our receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps were in a net liability position of 110 million, and the weighted average variable rate was 5.7 . For additional information on our interest rate swaps, see Note 13 Derivatives of the condensed notes to the consolidated financial statements. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . Under the direction of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have established disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as amended, or the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. The disclosure controls and procedures are also intended to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls 
 51 

Table of Contents 

 and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based upon our evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting . Management s assessment of, and conclusion on, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of the entities acquired in the Endeavor Acquisition on September 10, 2024. Under guidelines established by the SEC, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their assessment of internal control over financial reporting during the first year of an acquisition while integrating the acquired company. The Company is in the process of integrating Endeavor s and our internal controls over financial reporting. As a result of these integration activities, certain controls will be evaluated and may be changed. Except as noted above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the third quarter of 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal controls over financial reporting.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 We are a party to various routine legal proceedings, disputes and claims arising in the ordinary course of our business, including those that arise from interpretation of federal and state laws and regulations affecting the natural gas and crude oil industry, personal injury claims, title disputes, royalty disputes, contract claims, employment claims, claims alleging violations of antitrust laws, contamination claims relating to oil and natural gas exploration and development and environmental claims, including claims involving assets previously sold to third parties and no longer part of our current operations. While the ultimate outcome of the pending proceedings, disputes or claims and any resulting impact on us, cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that none of these matters, if ultimately decided adversely, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. See Note 16 Commitments and Contingencies of the condensed notes to the consolidated financial statements. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 Our business faces many risks. Any of the risks discussed in this report and our other SEC filings could have a material impact on our business, financial position or results of operations.

 CERTIFICATION OF PERIOD REPORT 
 In connection with the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of Diamondback Energy, Inc. (the Company ), as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the date hereof (the Report ), I, the undersigned, Travis D.
