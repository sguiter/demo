per annum, computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed and
a year of 365 days. Unless earlier converted into shares of Equity Securities, the principal and accrued interest will be due and
payable by the Company on demand by the Holders at any time after the earlier of (i) the Maturity Date (as defined in each Agreement)
and (ii) the closing of the Next Equity Financing (as defined below). The stated Maturity Date was extended in October 2023, under
the same terms, until October 31, 2024. 

The
Notes will automatically convert into the type of Equity Securities issued in the Next Equity Financing upon closing. The number of shares
of such Equity Securities to be issued will be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the outstanding principal and unpaid accrued
interest due on the Note on the date of conversion of of the price paid per share for Equity Securities by
the investors in the Next Equity Financing. Equity Securities refers to Company s common stock or preferred stock and Next Equity
Financing refers to the next sale (or series of related sales) by the Company of its equity securities from which the Company receives
gross proceeds of not less than (including the aggregate amount of debt securities converted into Equity Securities upon conversion
or cancellation of promissory notes) or , depending upon the signed agreement terms. 

In
the event that the Company raises aggregate additional cash proceeds of at least or through the sale of the Company s
equity securities, excluding the sales or conversions of Notes under the Agreement, the outstanding principal amount due will automatically,
and without any action on part of the holder, be converted into fully paid and non-assessable units of the Company s equity stock
sold in such qualified financing at of the equity stock conversion price. The Company, at its option, may pay all accrued, but
unpaid, interest and other charges in cash or by the issuance of additional equity stock at a rate of the applicable conversion price. 

The
Company evaluated the Notes in accordance with ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 ),
and determined the Notes are considered share-settled debt and should be recorded as a liability. This conclusion was determined based
on the debt providing the holder with a variable number of shares at settlement with an aggregate fair value equal to the debt instrument s
outstanding principal. The general measurement guidance in ASC 480 requires obligations that can be settled in shares with a fixed
monetary value at settlement (e.g., share-settled debt) to be carried at fair value unless other accounting guidance specifies another
measurement attribute. It has been determined that the appropriate guidance for share-settled debt is ASC 835. As a result, the
Notes were recorded at the amortized cost. 

On
August 2, 2024, the Company consummated its initial public offering, and the Convertible Notes, including accrued interest, converted
into shares of the Company s common stock.

below). The stated Maturity Date was extended in October 2023, under the same terms, until October 31, 2024. 

The
Notes will automatically convert into the type of Equity Securities issued in the Next Equity Financing upon closing. The number of shares
of such Equity Securities to be issued will be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the outstanding principal and unpaid accrued
interest due on the Note on the date of conversion of of the price paid per share for Equity Securities by the investors in the Next

next sale (or series of related sales) by the Company of its equity securities from which the Company receives gross proceeds of not
less than (including the aggregate amount of debt securities converted into Equity Securities upon conversion or cancellation
of promissory notes). 

In
the event that the Company raises aggregate additional cash proceeds of at least through the sale of the Company s
equity securities, excluding the sales or conversions of Notes under the Agreement, the outstanding principal amount due will automatically,
and without any action on part of the holder, be converted into fully paid and non-assessable units of the Company s equity stock

the Group E Convertible Notes, the Company agreed to issue an additional shares of common stock to the Group E Holders,
prorated based on such Holder s investment amount, as an inducement for their investment in the Group E Convertible Notes. 

The
Company, at its option, may pay all accrued, but unpaid, interest and other charges in cash or by the issuance of additional equity stock
at a rate of the applicable conversion price. 

The
Company evaluated the Notes in accordance with ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 ),
and determined the Notes are considered share-settled debt and should be recorded as a liability. This conclusion was determined based
on the debt providing the holder with a variable number of shares at settlement with an aggregate fair value equal to the debt instrument s
outstanding principal. The general measurement guidance in ASC 480 requires obligations that can be settled in shares with a fixed
monetary value at settlement (e.g., share-settled debt) to be carried at fair value unless other accounting guidance specifies another
measurement attribute. It has been determined that the appropriate guidance for share-settled debt is ASC 835. As a result, the
Notes were recorded at the amortized cost.

of Expected Returns Model PWERM ). This PWERM was determined to be the most appropriate method of estimating the value
of possible redemption or conversion outcomes over time, since the Company has not entered into a priced equity round through December
31, 2024. The fair value of the redemption liability is calculated using the initial value of the convertible note less the debt discount
rate of in Group A, in Groups B and C, and in Groups D, E and F. The redemption liability is then amortized over the
remaining life of the note, utilizing the interest rates of and respectively for the groups. The life of each note in Group A
is for a set period of 3 years, and is variable in Groups B, C, D, E and F with a range of 12 months to 3 years. The Company
retains the option to negotiate an extended maturity date for Groups B, C, D, E and F.

awards or settlements. If this were to happen, the payment of any such awards could have a material adverse effect on the results of
operations and financial position. Additionally, any such claims, whether or not successful, could damage the Company s reputation

Overview 

We
are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the identification, development and commercialization of treatments for Osteosarcoma
(OS) and other solid tumors. Our mission is to address the significant need for new treatments in cancers of the bone in children and
young adults. Osteosarcoma is an extremely challenging and often aggressive cancer that has particular treatment challenges due to its
location, changing genotypes and high metastases rates. We are currently seeking to answer the call for new treatments that will prevent
metastasis and the recurrence of metastases with our lead core product candidate OST-HER2 (also known as OST31-164), a cancer immunotherapy
product candidate that produces a cellular immune response against the cancer antigen HER2. In 2021, we opened a clinical study to produce
data for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of OST-HER2 in patients after resection
of recurrent Osteosarcoma, which achieved full enrollment of 41 patients in October 2023. We expect topline results from all 41
patients enrolled in the fourth quarter of 2024 and, if successful, intend to seek regulatory approval for OST-HER2 for the prevention
of metastases in Osteosarcoma in 2025. Upon success in gaining regulatory approval from the FDA with OST-HER2 in Osteosarcoma, we intend
to evaluate OST-HER2 s potential use, both alone and in combination with HER2 targeting antibodies such as Herceptin , in other
solid tumors including breast, esophageal and lung cancers. OST-HER2 has potential uses in both the prevention of metastases in solid
tumors, and therapeutically against HER2-expressing solid tumors treated with HER targeting antibodies. 

23 

We
also own rights to OST-Tunable Drug Conjugate (OST-tADC) platform, a next generation antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) silicone dioxide linker
technology. Tunable is a term used in drug development that refers to the properties that can be influenced by chemical
modifications, and antibody-drug conjugate or ADC is a term used to describe a drug made up of a monoclonal antibody attached
to a cytotoxic payload, or a highly active and toxic pharmaceutical molecule, through chemical linkers. The ADC links an antibody that
can home in on a targeted tumor to deploy the cytotoxic payload or toxic agent against the tumor. Furthering our founding mission, we
intend to investigate clinical indications for OST-tADC in Osteosarcoma and other solid tumors 

No
new treatments have been approved by the FDA for human Osteosarcoma for more than 40 years. In humans, Osteosarcoma is an extremely
rare cancer that primarily affects children, teenagers and young adults generally under 40 years of age. We are not aware of any
competing adjuvant therapy for Osteosarcoma to be tested in children that is further along in the development process than OST-HER2.
This disease is difficult to diagnose. The standard of care following first line therapies is simply to screen and wait for possible
recurrence/metastasis, or the development of secondary malignant growths at a distance from a primary site of cancer. Studies published
in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, Osteosarcoma Relapse After Combined Modality Therapy: An Analysis of Unselected Patients
in the Cooperative Osteosarcoma Study Group (COSS), by Kempf-Bielack B., et al. (January 2005), and Second and Subsequent
Recurrences of Osteosarcoma: Presentation, Treatment, and Outcomes of 249 Consecutive Cooperative Osteosarcoma Study Group Patients, 
by Bielack S., et al. (February 2009), reported that recurrence/metastasis happens in approximately half of all patients within 12
to 18 months following initial remittance. For those patients that experience recurrence, metastasis is typically to the lungs and
brain, with survival rates of approximately 13 over the next year, according to these studies. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 

Our
financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP ).
The preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, costs and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements.
We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under
the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that
are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

accounting policies are those that, in management s view, are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition
and results of operations and most demanding on their calls on judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect
of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. While our significant accounting policies are described
in more detail in Note 2 to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report, we believe that the following accounting
policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements. 

Debt
Discount and Redemption Premium 

We
evaluated the Group A Convertible Notes, the Group B Convertible Notes, the Group C Convertible Notes and the Bridge Notes (collectively,
the Convertible Notes in accordance with ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 and determined that the Convertible Notes are considered share-settled debt and should be recorded as a liability. This conclusion was
determined based on the debt providing the holder with a variable number of shares at settlement with an aggregate fair value equal to
the debt instrument s outstanding principal. The general measurement guidance in ASC 480 requires obligations that can be
settled in shares with a fixed monetary value at settlement (e.g., share-settled debt) to be carried at fair value unless other accounting
guidance specifies another measurement attribute. It has been determined that the appropriate guidance for share-settled debt is ASC 835.
As a result, the Convertible Notes will be recorded at the amortized cost. 

24 

The
initial fair value of the redemption value relating to the convertible debt instruments are capitalized and amortized over the term of
the related debt using the straight-line method, which approximates the interest method. If a loan is paid in full, any unamortized financing
costs will be removed from the related accounts and charged to operations. Amortization of debt discount is recorded as a component of
interest expense. In accordance with ASU 2015-03, Interest Imputation of Interest, the unamortized debt discount
is presented in the accompanying balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt. 

The fair value of the redemption
liability is calculated under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and is determined based upon a Probability-Weighted of Expected Returns
Model PWERM ). This PWERM was determined to be the most appropriate method of estimating the value of possible redemption
or conversion outcomes over time. The fair value of the redemption liability is calculated using the initial value of the Convertible
Notes less the debt discount rate of 12.5 in Group A, 20 in Groups B and C, and 50 in Groups D, E and F. The redemption liability is
then amortized over the remaining life of the note, utilizing the interest rates of 10 and 6 for the groups, respectively. The life
of each note in Group A is for a set period of three years and is variable in Groups B, C, D, E and F, with a range of 12 months to three
years. We retain the option to negotiate an extended maturity date for Groups B, C, D, E and F. The new embedded redemption values were
 0 and 1,541,250 for the periods ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

The
fees associated with the convertible debt raise are legal and investment fees associated with the issuance of the Convertible Notes for
Groups A, B, C, D, E and F. There were no related parties who received these fees. The fees are amortized over the life of the Convertible
Notes utilizing an interest rate of 10 for Group A and 6 for Groups B, C, D, E and F. 

Our
convertible debt raises and all associated accounts were closed out to stockholders equity on August 2, 2024, which was the date
on which we consummated our initial public offering and all outstanding convertible notes automatically converted into shares of common
stock. 

Components
of Our Results of Operations 

Revenue.
 We did not recognize revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Operating
Expenses. Our operating expenses are comprised primarily of research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses
and licensing costs. 

Research
and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities,
including our drug discovery efforts, and the development of our product candidates, which include: 

personnel-related
 costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, for employees engaged in research and development functions; 

expenses
 incurred in connection with our research programs, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants and contractors
 and CROs; 

the
 cost of developing and scaling our manufacturing process and manufacturing drug substance and drug product for use in our research
 and preclinical and clinical studies, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants and contractors and contract
 development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs); and 

the
 cost of laboratory supplies and research materials. 

25 

We
track our direct external research and development expenses on a program-by-program basis. These consist of costs that include fees,
reimbursed materials, and other costs paid to consultants, contractors, CDMOs, and CROs in connection with our preclinical, clinical
and manufacturing activities. We do not allocate employee costs, costs associated with our discovery efforts, and facilities expenses,
including depreciation or other indirect costs, to specific product development programs because these costs are deployed across multiple
programs and, as such, are not separately classified. 

We
expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially as we advance OST-HER2 and OST-tADC into clinical development
and expand our discovery, research and preclinical activities in the near term and in the future. 

General
and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs, including stock-based
compensation, for personnel in executive, finance and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include professional
fees for legal, patent, consulting, investor and public relations and accounting and audit services. 

We
anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support our continued
research activities and development of our product candidates. We also anticipate that we will incur increased accounting, audit, legal,
regulatory, compliance, and director and officer insurance costs as well as investor and public relations expenses associated with operating
as a public company. 

Licensing
Costs. Costs incurred in obtaining technology licenses and asset purchases are charged to licensing costs if the technology licensed
has not reached technological feasibility which includes manufacturing, clinical, intellectual property and/or regulatory success which
has no alternative future use. The licenses purchased by us require substantial completion of research and development and regulatory
and marketing approval efforts in order to reach technological feasibility. 

Interest
Expense. We evaluated the Convertible Notes in accordance with ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 ),
and determined the Convertible Notes are considered share-settled debt and should be recorded as a liability. This conclusion was determined
based on the debt providing the holder with a variable number of shares at settlement with an aggregate fair value equal to the debt
instrument s outstanding principal. The general measurement guidance in ASC 480 requires obligations that can be settled in
shares with a fixed monetary value at settlement (e.g., share-settled debt) to be carried at fair value unless other accounting guidance
specifies another measurement attribute. It has been determined that the appropriate guidance for share-settled debt is ASC 835.
As a result, the Convertible Notes were recorded at the amortized cost. 

Cumulative Series A
Preferred Stock Dividend. The Series A preferred stock dividend requirement represents the coupon dividends on our preferred
stock and is identified as a separate component of our statement of operations to compute net income (loss) available to common shareholders.
The coupon dividends are computed at 5 of the principal per annum and are recorded monthly. The cumulative accrued dividend at September
30, 2024 and 2023 was 375,000 and 312,500, respectively. The Series A preferred stock was converted into common stock on a 1:1 basis
in February 2024, and the last coupon dividend was issued in the quarter ended March 31, 2024. 

Income
Taxes. Since our inception, we have not recorded income tax benefits for the net operating losses incurred or the research and
development tax credits generated in each year, due to the uncertainty of realizing a benefit from those items. 

As
of December 31, 2023, we had U.S. federal net operating loss carry forwards of approximately 16.3 million, which may be available
to offset future taxable income. The federal net operating loss carry forward indefinitely but may only be used to offset 80 of annual
taxable income. As of December 31, 2023, we also had federal and state general business tax credit carry forwards of 1.4 million
available to offset future tax liabilities and expire at various dates beginning in January 1, 2022. We have R D credits that
we opted to convert and use toward payroll taxes in amounts equal to 0.3 million as of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023,
we also had a federal and state research and development tax credit carry forwards of approximately 0.3 million, which may be available
to offset future tax liabilities and expire at various dates beginning January 1, 2024 and January 1, 2023, respectively. 

26 

Deferred
Offering Costs. Deferred offering costs consisted of legal, accounting, printing and filing fees that we capitalized, which will
be offset against the gross proceeds from our initial public offering.

Research and Development
Expenses. Research and development expenses were approximately 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024
compared to approximately 0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease
in vendor expenses associated with our Phase IIb clinical trial and a decrease in vendor expenses associated with out OST-tADC platform
technology. The following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and

and staff payroll fees. In 2024, such expenses were primarily lab fees and related clinical support of approximately 1.0 million attributed
to our Phase IIb clinical trial preparation and CRO costs as we completed IND-enabling studies. OST-tADC related direct research and development
expenses were approximately 0.0 million and 0.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

General and Administrative
Expenses. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 1.2 million
compared to 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. These expenses were primarily attributed to marketing costs
and accounting fees to consultants. 

27 

Licensing Costs. We
did not have any licensing costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Interest Expense. Interest
expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 0.4 million compared to 1.4 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2023. The amounts of interest are comprised of accretion of debt discount being amortized in 2024 and 2023
from associated discounts related to convertible notes and placement agent warrants, together with interest expenses from the issuances
of convertible notes.

Interest
Expense. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 2.0 million compared to 3.1 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The amounts of interest are comprised of accretion of debt discount being amortized in
2024 and 2023 from associated discounts related to convertible notes and placement agent warrants, together with interest expenses from
the issuances of convertible notes. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Operating
Losses 

Since our inception, we have
incurred significant operating losses. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily
on the successful development and eventual commercialization of our product candidates. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and
2023, we reported a net loss of approximately 5.9 million and 6.4 million, respectively, and had an accumulated deficit of approximately
 35.4 million and 28.0 million, respectively. We expect to incur significant expenses at an increasing rate and increasing operating
losses for the foreseeable future. 

As of September 30, 2024
and 2023, we had cash of approximately 1.9 million and 0.02 million, respectively. We have funded our operations to date primarily from
the sale of our convertible notes in our private placements, which have provided total gross proceeds of 19.2 million as of July 31,
2024. We believe that the net proceeds from our private placements, together with our existing cash, will enable us to fund our operating
expenses and capital expenditure requirements for the next three to nine months. 

We
consummated our initial public offering on August 2, 2024, converting all our outstanding Convertible Notes into common stock and raising
 6.4 million in gross proceeds on the sale of 1.6 million shares of our common stock. Net proceeds from our initial public offering were
used to pay off accounts payable and fund continuing losses through September 30, 2024.

Operating
Activities 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, operating activities used approximately 4.9 million and 2.1 million of cash,
respectively, resulting from our net loss of approximately 5.9 million and 6.3 million, respectively, offset by net non-cash charges
of approximately 1.4 million and 2.6 million, respectively, partially offset by net cash provided by changes in our operating
assets and liabilities of approximately (0.4) million and 1.6 million, respectively. 

Net cash provided by changes
in our operating assets and liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 consisted primarily of an increase (decrease)
in accounts payable of approximately (0.9) million and 1.1 million, respectively, an increase in accrued interest of approximately
 0.6 million and 0.7 million, respectively, and a change in accrued payroll of approximately (0.1) million and (0.1) million,
respectively. 

29 

Non-cash
charges for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were primarily the result of the amortization of debt discount on our convertible
debt of approximately 1.4 million and 2.4 million, respectively. Changes in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current
liabilities and prepaid expenses and other current assets in all periods were generally due to growth in our business, the advancement
of our research programs and the timing of vendor invoicing and payments. 

Investing
Activities 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash provided by investing activities was approximately 0.0 million and 0.0 million,
respectively. 

Financing
Activities 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was approximately 6.7 million and 2.0 million,
respectively. The net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 consisted of net proceeds
from sales of convertible notes and our initial public offering, reduced by capitalized deferred offering costs. 

Convertible
Notes 

We
have completed seven separate private financing transactions from July 2018 to April 2024 in which we issued the Convertible Notes
and raised total gross proceeds of 19,186,520 from accredited investors.

The total accrued interest
on the convertible notes listed in the table above was approximately 0.0 million and 2.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023, respectively. The carrying amount and face amount of such convertible notes differ because of the unamortized debt issuance
costs and the debt discount (which are amortized over the original term of the instrument) see accounting policy discussion
below. The material terms of each group of Convertible Notes are described below. The Convertible Notes, including interest accrued thereon,
automatically converted into common stock upon consummation of our initial public offering on August 2, 2024. 

Group
A Convertible Notes. From July 2018 through November 2021, we issued convertible notes in an aggregate principal amount
of 1,154,000 (the Group A Convertible Notes to accredited investors, including related parties. Interest on the unpaid
principal balance on the Group A Convertible Notes accrued at a rate of 10 per annum, computed on the basis of the actual number of days
elapsed and a year of 365 days. Unless earlier converted into shares of Equity Securities, the principal and accrued interest on
the Group A Convertible Notes were due and payable by us on demand by the holders of such convertible notes at any time after the earlier
of (i) the Maturity Date and (ii) the closing of the Next Equity Financing (which was our initial public offering). In general,
the stated Maturity Date varied from the date of issuance of two to four years and was extended in October 2023, under the
same terms, until October 31, 2024. 

The
Group A Convertible Notes automatically converted into shares of our common stock upon the consummation of our initial public offering.
The number of shares of our common stock issued upon the automatic conversion was equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the outstanding
principal and unpaid accrued interest due on the Group A Convertible Note on the date of conversion by a percentage between 80 to 87.5 ,
as applicable, of the initial public offering price per share in such offering. The Group A Convertible Notes had conversion capitalization
ceilings that ranged from 5 million to 25 million, which limited the price a noteholder must pay in a convertible note-to-common
stock conversion occurrence. The Group A Convertible Notes had a conversion price that ranged from 0.39 to 1.97 per share, depending
on the applicable valuation ceiling of each note (based on the initial public offering price of 4.00 per share). 

Group
B Convertible Notes. From April 2020 through June 2021, we issued convertible notes in an aggregate principal amount
of 5,154,000 (the Group B Convertible Notes to accredited investors. Interest on the unpaid principal balance of the
Group B Convertible Notes accrued at a rate of 6 per annum, computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed and a year
of 365 days. Unless earlier converted into shares of Equity Securities, the principal and accrued interest were due and payable
by us on demand by the convertible holders of such notes at any time after the earlier of (i) the Maturity Date and (ii) the
closing of the Next Equity Financing (which was our initial public offering). In general, the stated Maturity Date was March 31,
2022 but was extended in October 2023, under the same terms, until October 31, 2024. 

The
Group B Convertible Notes automatically converted into shares of our common stock upon the consummation of our initial public offering.
The number of shares of our common stock issued upon the automatic conversion was equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the outstanding
principal and unpaid accrued interest due on the Group B Convertible Note on the date of conversion by 80 of the initial public offering
price per share in such offering. The Group B Convertible Notes had a conversion capitalization ceiling of 19 million, which limited
the price a noteholder must pay in a convertible note-to-common stock conversion occurrence. As a result of the valuation ceiling, the
Group B Convertible Notes had a conversion price of 1.31 per share (based on the initial public offering price of 4.00 per share). 

Group
C Convertible Notes. From June 2021 through January 2023, we issued convertible notes in an aggregate principal amount of
 3,945,020 (the Group C Convertible Notes to accredited investors. Interest on the unpaid principal balance of the Group
C Convertible Notes accrued at a rate of 6 per annum, computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed and a year of
365 days. Unless earlier converted into shares of Equity Securities, the principal and accrued interest were due and payable by
us on demand by the holders of such convertible notes at any time after the earlier of (i) the Maturity Date and (ii) the closing
of the Next Equity Financing (which was our initial public offering). In general, the stated Maturity Date was May 31, 2024 but
was extended in October 2023, under the same terms, until October 31, 2024. 

31 

The
Group C Convertible Notes automatically converted into shares of our common stock upon the consummation of our initial public
offering. The number of shares of our common stock issued upon the automatic conversion was equal to the quotient obtained by
dividing the outstanding principal and unpaid accrued interest due on the Group C Convertible Note on the date of conversion by 80 
of the initial public offering price per share in such offering. The Group C Convertible Notes had a conversion capitalization
ceiling of 50 million, except that one note was subject to a valuation ceiling of 19 million, which limited the price a noteholder
must pay in a convertible note-to-common stock conversion occurrence. As a result of the applicable valuation ceiling, the Group C
Convertible Notes had a conversion price of 1.31 or 2.59 per share, as applicable (based on the initial public offering price of
 4.00 per share). 

Bridge
Notes (Groups D, E and F). In November 2022, we issued convertible notes in an aggregate principal amount of 2,000,000
(the Group D Convertible Notes to accredited investors. From February to June 2023, we issued convertible notes in an
aggregate principal amount of 1,100,000 (the Group E Convertible Notes to accredited investors. From June 2023 to April
2024, we issued convertible notes in an aggregate principal amount of 3,433,500 (the Group F Convertible Notes and,
collectively with the Group D Convertible Notes and Group E Convertible Notes, the Bridge Notes to accredited investors,
of which an aggregate of 750,000 was issued in April 2024. Interest on the unpaid principal balance of the Bridge Notes accrued at a
rate of 6 per annum, computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed and a year of 365 days. Unless earlier converted
into shares of Equity Securities, the principal and accrued interest was due and payable by us on demand by the holders of such convertible
notes at any time after the earlier of (i) the Maturity Date and (ii) the closing of the Next Equity Financing (which was our
initial public offering). In general, the stated Maturity Date was October 31, 2024. 

The
Bridge Notes automatically converted into shares of our common stock upon the consummation of our initial public offering. The number
of shares of our common stock issued upon the automatic conversion was equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the outstanding principal
and unpaid accrued interest due on a Bridge Note on the date of conversion by 50 of the initial public offering price per share in such
offering. The Bridge Notes had a conversion capitalization ceiling of 50 million, which limited the price a noteholder must pay
in a convertible note-to-common stock conversion occurrence. As a result of the valuation ceiling, the Bridge Notes had a conversion
price of 2.00 per share (based on the initial public offering price of 4.00 per share). 

Demand
Notes. On March 6, 2024 and June 28, 2024, we issued demand promissory notes to a lender who was an investor in one of our prior
convertible notes rounds in a principal amount of 100,000 and 150,000, respectively. The demand notes bear interest at a rate of 8 
per annum and the principal plus all accrued interest is payable upon demand by such lender. If such notes are not paid on demand by
us, interest will accrue at a rate of the lesser of 16 per annum and the highest rate of interest allowable under Maryland law. 

As
of August 14, 2024, we have repaid the demand notes in full. 

BlinkBio.
 On August 19, 2020, we issued a convertible note with a principal amount of 2,400,000 (the BlinkBio Convertible
Note to BlinkBio, Inc., which is a related party based on Dr. Goddard being our Chairman and as the Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer of BlinkBio, in exchange for the entry into the license agreement. On March 15, 2021, the principal and unpaid accrued interest
of 100,000 of the BlinkBio Convertible Note converted into 1,302,082 shares of our Series A preferred stock and then distributed
to BlinkBio stockholders. The BlinkBio Convertible Note had a conversion capitalization ceiling of 19.2 million, which limited
the price a noteholder must pay in a convertible note-to-common stock conversion occurrence. On February 9, 2024, the 1,302,082 shares
of our Series A preferred stock were converted into 651,041 shares of common stock (on a post-split basis). 

TEDCO
Grant. In May 2021, we received the first of two tranches from TEDCO s Rural Underserved Business Recovery
from Impact of Covid-19 (RUBRIC) Grant in the amount of 50,000. In October 2021, we received the second tranche of 50,000, which
brought the total reimbursable grant amount to 100,000. We are obligated to report on and pay to TEDCO 3 of their quarterly revenues
for a five-year period following the reward date. Income from grants and investments are not considered revenues. Royalties due to TEDCO
are capped at 150 of the amount of the award, or 150,000. We have the option to eliminate the quarterly royalty obligation by making
an advance payment prior to the end of the five-year period, in which case, we will receive a 10 reduction of the royalty cap percentage
for each year prior to the expiration of the five-year reimbursement period that the grant is repaid in full. If we cease to meet eligibility
requirements at any time, the reimbursement obligation will become due to TEDCO immediately; however, the discount for meeting the obligation
will still apply.

Contractual
Obligations and Other Commitments 

We
enter into contracts in the normal course of business with our CDMOs, CROs and other third parties to support preclinical research studies
and testing and other development activities. These contracts are generally cancellable by us. Payments due upon cancellation consist
only of payments for services provided or expenses incurred, including non-cancellable obligations of our service providers, up to the
date of cancellation.

BlinkBio.
 In August 2020, we entered into a licensing agreement with BlinkBio, Inc., a privately-held developer of drug conjugate
therapies designed to facilitate the treatment of cancer. Pursuant to this agreement, BlinkBio granted a license to us that allows us
to utilize BlinkBio s proprietary technology to develop, manufacture and commercialize certain of our products. BlinkBio granted
us an exclusive license for tunable drug conjugates that are directed towards, binds to or modifies the folate receptor alpha and a co-exclusive
license for tunable drug conjugates that are directed towards, binds to or modifies any target other than the folate receptor alpha,

In
connection with the license agreement, we also agreed to issue the BlinkBio Convertible Note. See Convertible Notes

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules
and regulations of the SEC. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

A
description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position and results of operations
is disclosed in Note 2 to Notes to the Financial Statements appearing elsewhere in this report. 

The
JOBS Act 

The
JOBS Act permits an emerging growth company such as us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised
accounting standards applicable to public companies until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected
to avail ourselves of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised financial accounting standards. 

We
will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of our first fiscal year in which we have total
annual gross revenues of 1.235 billion or more; (ii) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer 
under the rules of the SEC with at least 700.0 million of outstanding equity securities held by non-affiliates; (iii) the
date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the previous three years; or
(iv) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of our initial public offering. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

Not
applicable. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange
Act )) are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports
that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures,
no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Due to the
inherent limitations of control systems, not all misstatements may be detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that
judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls
can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control.
Controls and procedures can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the above objectives have been met. 

The
Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded as of September 30, 2024, that the disclosure controls and procedures are not effective
due to lack of segregation of duties as a result of limited personnel and insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting,
information technology and financial reporting. 

There
have not been any changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the first, second or
third quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control
over financial reporting.

PART
II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings. 

We
are not currently a party to any pending or threatened legal proceedings other than the arbitration proceeding described below. 

On
April 12, 2024, Noble Capital Markets, Inc. Noble filed a Demand for Arbitration against us in JAMS, claiming that
we breached the anti-dilution provision in the parties advisory agreement by not issuing to Noble an additional 474,134 shares
of our common stock. In September 2024, we settled the matter with Noble in exchange for 50,000 and 320,033 shares of our
common stock, which were issued during September 2024. 

See
also Note 6 to our financial statements contained in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which is incorporated herein
by reference. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors. 

You
should carefully consider the factors discussed under the section entitled Risk Factors in our Registration Statement on
Form S-1 (File No. 333-283171), initially filed with the SEC on November 1, 2024, as such factors could materially affect our business,
financial condition, and future results. The risks described in such registration statement are not the only risks that we face. Additional
risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, also may have a material adverse impact
on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 

Item
2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 

Unregistered
Sales of Equity Securities by the Issuer 

On October 31, 2024,
we entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement with the Investor, pursuant to which we will have the right, but not the obligation, to
sell to the Investor, and the Investor will have the obligation to purchase from us, up to the Maximum Commitment Amount worth of shares
of our common stock, at our sole discretion, over the next 24 months, subject to certain conditions precedent and other limitations set
forth in the Equity Purchase Agreement. Concurrently with the execution of the Equity Purchase Agreement, we also agreed to issue to
the Investor, as part of the consideration, shares of the Company s common stock worth a total of 3 of the Maximum Commitment
Amount (the Initial Commitment Shares ). The ultimate calculation of the per share price of the Initial Commitment Shares
will occur on the date immediately prior to a registration statement on Form S-1 covering the resale of the shares to be issued pursuant
to the Equity Purchase Agreement. 

The shares of common stock
are being offered and sold by us to the Investor pursuant to the Equity Purchase Agreement in reliance upon an exemption from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 506(b) of Regulation D promulgated
thereunder. 

Use
of Proceeds 

On July 31, 2024, our registration
statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-276350) was declared effective by the SEC for our initial public offering, which was underwritten
by Brookline Capital Markets. At the closing of our initial public offering on August 2, 2024, we sold 1,600,000 shares of common stock
at an initial public offering price of 4.00 per share and received gross proceeds of 6.4 million, which resulted in net proceeds to
us of approximately 6.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately 0.4 million. As of November
14, 2024, we estimate that we have used approximately 5.5 million of the proceeds from our initial public offering for general corporate
purposes, including to advance the development of OST-HER2 and OST-tADC. There has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds
from that described in the final prospectus for our initial public offering filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) under the Securities
Act.
