 In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future generation of taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences representing net future deductible amounts become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. There was valuation allowance on the Company's deferred tax assets as of October 31, 2024 or January 31, 2024. 
 The Company evaluated the provisions of ASC 740 related to the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements. ASC 740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, present, and disclose uncertain positions that the Company has taken or expects to take in its tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. Differences between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the net benefit recognized and measured pursuant to the interpretation are referred to as unrecognized benefits. A liability is recognized (or amount of net operating loss carryforward or amount of tax refundable is reduced) for unrecognized tax benefit because it represents an enterprise s potential future obligation to the taxing authority for a tax position that was not recognized as a result of applying the provisions of ASC 740.

 Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 
 The following table sets forth the summary of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 
 For the Three Months Ended October 31, 2024 October 31, 2023 Net sales 31,523 28,648 Costs of sales 24,410 20,013 Gross Profit 7,113 8,635 Operating Expenses 6,550 5,928 Other Expenses, net (25) (130) Income Tax Expense (128) (568) Net Income 410 2,009 
 For the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company reported net income of approximately 0.4 million and 2.0 million respectively. The change in net income between the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 is due to the changes in net sales, costs of sales and operating expenses described below. 
 Net sales: Net Sales increased by approximately 10 to 31.5 million during the three months ended October 31, 2024, from 28.6 million during the three months ended October 31, 2023. The increase in sales is due to volume gains and successful pricing actions. Volume gains were driven by increased demand at existing customers, successful trade and marketing promotions, same-customer cross-selling of new items, and new customer door expansion. 
 Costs of sales: Costs of sales increased by approximately 22 to 24.4 million, or 77 of Net Sales, during the three months ended October 31, 2024, from 20 million, or 70 of Net Sales, during the three months ended October 31, 2023. The increase in Costs of sales as a percentage of Net Sales is due to increases in commodity costs, primarily the cost of chicken, and the non-recurring impact from construction surrounding the now completed installation of strategic capital equipment projects, partially offset by improvements in procurement, manufacturing and labor efficiencies. 
 Gross Profit Margin: The gross profit margin was 23 and 30 for the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in gross profit margin between the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 is due to increased commodity costs and construction-related inefficiencies as noted above, which were partially offset by customer price increases, improvements in procurement, and manufacturing efficiencies.

 Operating Expenses: Operating expenses increased approximately 622 thousand during the three months ended October 31, 2024, as compared to the three months ended October 31, 2023. The change in total operating expenses is primarily attributable to the following:

 Payroll and Related Expenses inclusive of stock-based compensation increased by approximately 178 thousand mainly related to new executive hires and variable compensation arrangements; 
 Commission and royalty expenses increased by approximately 162 thousand due to increased sales; 
 Professional fees and director fees increased by approximately 76 thousand mainly related to increase in corporate activity in the current year; 
 Freight-related expenses decreased by approximately 146 thousand mainly related to a greater focus on full truckload sales versus less than full truckload sales as well as stronger supplier management of carriers; 
 Insurance expense decreased by approximately 40 thousand mainly related to updated terms of coverage; and 
 Other operating expenses increased by approximately 50 thousand due to additional travel and office expenses. 
 Other Expenses, net: Other expenses, net decreased by approximately 105 thousand to 25 thousand for the three months ended October 31, 2024, as compared to 130 thousand for the three months ended October 31, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to interest income of approximately 37 thousand and decreased interest expense of approximately 249 thousand due to a lower debt balance .

 Net sales: Net Sales increased by approximately 17.2 to 89.7 million during the nine months ended October 31, 2024, from 76.6 million during the nine months ended October 31, 2023.

 As of October 31, 2024, we had working capital of approximately 3.2 million as compared to working capital of approximately 6.9 million as of January 31, 2024.

 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), as amended (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.

In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Due to the inherent limitations of control systems, not all misstatements may be detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. Controls and procedures can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the above objectives have been met. 
 As of October 31, 2024, we evaluated, with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, at the reasonable assurance level, in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
