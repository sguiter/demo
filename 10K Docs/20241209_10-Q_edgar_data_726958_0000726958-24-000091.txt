 Series I and J Senior Notes 
 On October 4, 2024, the Company entered into a note purchase agreement with respect to the issuance of aggregate principal amount of senior notes, consisting of: (i) aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes, Series I, due November 2, 2031; and (ii) aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes, Series J, due November 2, 2034 (collectively, the Notes ). The Notes were issued on October 30, 2024. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually on May 2 and November 2 of each year. The Company used the proceeds of the Notes to partially fund the Fikes Wholesale acquisition, which closed subsequent to quarter end on November 1, 2024. For additional information on the Fikes Wholesale acquisition, please refer to Note 9 . As of October 31, 2024, there was outstanding on the Notes. 
 Amended Credit Agreement 
 The Company is party to a credit agreement, dated as of April 21, 2023 (the Existing Credit Agreement ). On October 30, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment to the Existing Credit Agreement (the Amendment and, together with the Existing Credit Agreement, the Credit Agreement ), pursuant to which the Company incurred an incremental term loan in an aggregate principal amount of (the Incremental Term Loan ). The outstanding principal balance of the Incremental Term Loan is required to be repaid in equal quarterly installments of on the last business day of each March, June, September, and December, commencing March 31, 2025, with the remaining balance due on October 30, 2029. The proceeds of the Incremental Term Loan were used to partially fund the Fikes Wholesale acquisition, which closed subsequent to quarter end on November 1, 2024 (see further discussion of the Fikes Wholesale acquisition in Note 9 ). As of October 31, 2024, there was outstanding on the Incremental Term Loan. 
 Amounts borrowed under the Credit Agreement, including the Incremental Term Loan and the Revolving Facility discussed immediately below, bear interest at variable rates based upon, at the Company s option, either: (a) either Term SOFR or Daily Simple SOFR, in each case plus (with a floor of for the interest period in effect, plus an applicable margin ranging from to or (b) an alternate base rate, which generally equals the highest of (i) the prime commercial lending rate announced by the Administrative Agent as its prime rate , (ii) the federal funds rate plus 1/2 of 1.00 , and (iii) Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR plus , each plus an applicable margin ranging from to and each with a floor of . The applicable margins and facility fee, in each case, are dependent upon the Company s quarterly Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined in the credit agreement. 
 Revolving Facility

 share against the maximum limit under the 2018 Plan, and each share issued pursuant to an award of restricted stock or restricted stock units is counted as shares against the maximum limit. Restricted stock is transferred immediately upon grant (and may be subject to a holding period), whereas restricted stock units have a vesting period that must expire, and in some cases performance or market conditions that must be satisfied before the stock is transferred. At October 31, 2024, there were shares available for grant under the 2018 Plan. 
 We account for share-based compensation by estimating the grant date fair value of time-based and performance-based restricted stock unit awards using the closing price of our common stock on the applicable grant date, or the date on which performance goals for performance-based units are established, if after the grant date. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur. 
 The time-based awards most commonly vest ratably over a period commencing on the first anniversary of the grant date. The performance-based awards represent a target amount; the final amount earned is based on the satisfaction of certain performance measures over a performance period and will range from to of target." Additionally, if the Company's relative total shareholder return over the performance period is in the bottom or top quartile of the companies comprising the S P 500, the performance-based shares included will be adjusted downward by , or upward by , respectively (the "TSR Modifier"). The fair value of the awards with the TSR Modifier is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation as of the date of the grant. For market-based awards, the share-based compensation expense will not be adjusted should the target awards vary from actual awards. 
 We recognize these amounts as an operating expense in our condensed consolidated statements of income ratably over the requisite service period using the straight-line method, as adjusted for certain retirement provisions, and updated estimates of shares to be issued under performance-based awards. All awards have been granted at no cost to the grantee.

 current and/or former Store Managers remain opted-in to participate in the McColley lawsuit. The Company is also named in a related lawsuit filed in the Southern District of Illinois, titled Kessler v. Casey s Marketing Company, et al., with substantially the same allegations and seeking the same relief, but instead for the plaintiff and all similarly situated Store Managers located in the state of Illinois from December 19, 2019, to the present. On October 13, 2023, the Court approved conditional certification, and to-date, approximately current and/or f ormer Store Managers remain opted-in to participate in the Kessler lawsuit. Discovery in the McColley case is currently underway. The Company believes that adequate provisions have been made for probable losses related to these matters, and that those, and the reasonably possible losses in excess of amounts accrued, where such range of loss can be estimated, are not material to the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company believes that its Store Managers are properly classified as exempt employees under the FLSA and it intends to continue to vigorously defend these matters.

 and at October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, respectively. If this unrecognized tax benefit were ultimately recognized, is the amount that would impact our effective tax rate. The total net amount of accrued interest and penalties for such unrecognized tax benefits was at October 31, 2024, and at April 30, 2024. Net interest and penalties included in income tax expense for the six months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 was a net expense of and , respectively. 
 A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and ultimately settled. It is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome or the timing of resolution for uncertain tax positions. It is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months. These changes could result from the expiration of the statute of limitations, examinations or other unforeseen circumstances. The State of Illinois is currently examining tax years 2020 and 2021. The Company has no other ongoing federal or state income tax examinations. At this time, the Company s best estimate of the reasonably possible change in the amount of the gross unrecognized tax benefits is a decrease of during the next twelve months mainly due to the expiration of certain statute of limitations. 
 The federal statute of limitations remains open for the tax years 2020 and forward. Tax years 2019 and forward are subject to audit by state tax authorities depending on open statute of limitations waivers and the tax code of each state.

 stores in states. Our convenience stores offer a broad selection of merchandise, fuel and other products and services designed to appeal to the convenience needs of our guests. We manage the business on the basis of operating segment and therefore, have only reportable segment. Our stores sell similar products and services, use similar processes to sell those products and services, and sell their products and services to similar classes of guests. We make specific disclosures concerning the broad categories of fuel, grocery and general merchandise, and prepared food and dispensed beverage because it allows us to more effectively discuss trends and operational initiatives within our business and industry. Although we can separate revenue and cost of goods sold within these categories (and further sub-categories), the operating expenses associated with operating a store that sells these products are not separable by these categories.

 additional stores to Texas, as well as stores in Alabama, Florida, and Mississippi. 
 The Fikes acquisition was financed with the Incremental Term Loan of , the issuance of the Series I and J Notes in the amount of , and cash on hand. For further information, see Note 4 . 
 The proceeds of the Incremental Term Loan and Series I and J Notes were received by the Company on October 30, 2024. However, the Fikes acquisition did not close until November 1, 2024, subsequent to quarter end. As such, as of October 31, 2024 the Company had in a funding account governed by an escrow and disbursing agreement, primarily to use for the acquisition of Fikes, as well as other related adjustments and transaction costs. As a result, we have recognized this balance as restricted cash within long-term assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The cash was subsequently paid on November 1, 2024, primarily to fund the acquisition. 
 Due to the proximity of the Fikes acquisition to the filing of our Form 10-Q, we have not yet completed the accounting for the business combination, including the opening balance sheet. Accordingly, the Company is unable to provide amounts recognized as of the acquisition dates for major classes of assets and liabilities. Moreover, we are unable to provide pro-forma financial information related to the combined entity. This information, at least on a provisional basis, will be available in the Form 10-Q to be filed for the quarter ended January 31, 2025.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Dollars in Thousands) . 

Overview 
 As of October 31, 2024, Casey s General Stores, Inc. and its direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries operate convenience stores primarily under the names "Casey's" and "Casey s General Store" (collectively, with the stores below referenced as "GoodStop", "Bucky's", "Minit Mart", or "Lone Star Food Store", referred to as "Casey's" or the "Company") throughout 17 states, over half of which are located in Iowa, Missouri and Illinois. Subsequent to quarter-end, on November 1, 2024, the Company closed on the acquisition of Fikes Wholesale and Group Petroleum Services (collectively "Fikes"), owner of CEFCO Convenience Stores, in which we added 198 total stores. The acquisition will bring 148 additional stores to Texas, as well as 50 stores in Alabama, Florida, and Mississippi. 
 Approximately 72 of all stores were opened in areas with populations of fewer than 20,000 persons. The Company competes on the basis of price, as well as on the basis of traditional features of convenience store operations such as location, extended hours, product offerings, and quality of service. As of October 31, 2024, there were a total of 2,685 stores in operation. 
 All convenience stores carry a broad selection of food items (including, but not limited to, freshly prepared foods such as regular and breakfast pizza, donuts, hot breakfast items, and hot and cold sandwiches), beverages, tobacco and nicotine products, health and beauty aids, automotive products, and other nonfood items. As of October 31, 2024, 236 store locations offered car washes. In addition, all but six store locations offer fuel for sale on a self-service basis. 
 The Company had 64 stores operating under the "GoodStop (by Casey s)" brand and 12 stores operating under the "Lone Star Food Store" brand as of October 31, 2024. Similar to most of our store footprint, the "GoodStop" and "Lone Star Food Store" locations offer fuel for sale on a self-serve basis, and a broad selection of snacks, beverages, tobacco products, and other essentials. However, some of these locations do not have a kitchen and have limited prepared food offerings. 
 The Company is also temporarily operating certain locations acquired from Buchanan Energy under the name "Bucky's". The Company is in the process of transitioning all "Bucky's" locations to either the "Casey's" or "GoodStop" brand. These locations typically have similar offerings to the "Casey s" or "GoodStop" branded stores. 
 The Company has 71 dealer locations, where Casey s manages fuel wholesale supply agreements to these stores. These locations are not operated by Casey's and are not included in our overall store count in the table below. Approximately 1 of total revenue for the six-months ended October 31, 2024 relates to this dealer network. 
 The Company operates three distribution centers, through which certain grocery and general merchandise and prepared food and dispensed beverage items are supplied to our stores. One distribution center is adjacent to our corporate headquarters, which we refer to as the Store Support Center facility in Ankeny, Iowa. The other two distribution centers are located in Terre Haute, Indiana and Joplin, Missouri. 
 The Company s business is seasonal, and generally experiences higher sales and profitability during the first and second fiscal quarters (May-October), when guests tend to purchase greater quantities of fuel and certain convenience items such as beer, sports drinks, water, soft drinks and ice. 
 The Company reported diluted earnings per common share of 4.85 for the second quarter of fiscal 2025. For the same quarter a year-ago, diluted earnings per common share was 4.24. 
 The following table represents the roll forward of store growth through the second quarter of fiscal 2025: 
 Store Count Total stores at April 30, 2024 2,658 New store construction 18 Acquisitions 18 Closed (9) Total stores at October 31, 2024 2,685 
 The acquisition of Fikes, subsequent to quarter end, as discussed in Note 9 , brought 198 additional stores into our store count. This brought the total store count to approximately 2,900 stores.

Fuel Volatility 
 Since early calendar 2020, the price of crude oil, and in turn the wholesale cost of refined fuel products, has been volatile compared to historical averages. Initially, at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, oil and fuel prices fell dramatically; however, as the economy in general began to emerge from the pandemic, prices began to modestly increase over time. Oil and fuel prices continued to be impacted throughout fiscal 2024 and through the second quarter of fiscal 2025 as a result of geopolitical issues and localized supply disruptions. 
 In addition, during the past four calendar years, the Company, and the retail fuel industry, has experienced historically high average revenue less cost of goods sold per gallon (excluding depreciation and amortization). Although this has remained relatively consistent since that time, this metric can fluctuate significantly, and sometimes unpredictably, in the short-term. While the Company believes that its average revenue less cost of goods sold per gallon (excluding depreciation and amortization) may remain elevated from historical levels for the foreseeable future, it is possible that increased oil and fuel prices, higher interest rates, macroeconomic conditions and/or continuing conflicts or disruptions involving oil producing countries may materially impact the performance of this metric. 
 Electric Vehicles and Renewable Fuels 
 Casey's continues its process of implementing an electric vehicle ("EV") strategy and our management team remains committed to understanding if and how the increased demand for, and usage of, EVs impacts consumer behavior across our store footprint and beyond. As consumer demand for alternative fuel options continues to grow, Casey s has continued to add EV charging stations across our 17-state footprint. As of October 31, 2024, the Company has 178 charging stations at 41 stores, across 13 states. Our EV growth strategy is currently designed to selectively increase our charging stations at locations within our region where we see higher levels of consumer EV buying trends and demand for EV charging. To date, consumer EV demand within our Midwest footprint has been comparatively lower than the levels along the coasts. As EV demand from our guests increases, we are prepared to strategically integrate charging stations at select stores. 
 The Company also remains committed to offering renewable fuel options at our stores and continues to expand its alternative fuel options in response to evolving guest needs and as part of its environmental stewardship efforts. Currently, almost all of our stores offer fuel with at least 10 of blended ethanol and 43 of our stores offer biodiesel. Every newly built store has the capability to sell renewable fuels, and we aim to continue growing sales of renewable fuels throughout our footprint. 
 Same-Store Sales 
 Same-store sales is a common metric used in the convenience store industry. We define same-store sales as the total sales increase (or decrease) for stores open during the full time of both periods being presented. When comparing data, the store must be open for each entire fiscal period being compared. Remodeled stores that remained open or were closed for just a very brief period of time (i.e., less than a week) during the period being compared remain in the same-store sales comparison. If a store is replaced, either at the same location (i.e., razed and rebuilt) or relocated to a new location, it is removed from the comparison until the new store has been open for each entire period being compared. Newly constructed and acquired stores do not enter the calculation until they are open for each entire period being compared. 
 Same-store sales of prepared food and dispensed beverage increased 5.2 and grocery and general merchandise increased 3.6 during the quarter. The increase in prepared food and dispensed beverage same-store sales was attributable to strong sales of hot sandwiches and dispensed beverages. The increase in grocery and general merchandise same-store sales was primarily due to sales of non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages. Additionally, the second quarter results reflected a 0.6 decrease in same-store fuel gallons sold.

 The effective tax rate increased to 24.5 in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to 23.6 in the same period of fiscal 2024. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a one-time benefit in the prior year from adjusting the Company s deferred tax assets and liabilities for state law changes enacted during the quarter. 
 Net income increased by 22,136 (13.9 to 180,918 from 158,782 in the comparable period in the prior year.

 Operating expenses increased by 78,595 (6.9 in the first six months of fiscal 2025 from the comparable period in the prior year. Approximately 5 of the increase is due to operating 93 more stores than the comparable period in the prior year. Same-store employee expense contributed to approximately 1 of the increase, as the increases in wage rates were partially offset by a reduction in same-store labor hours. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased 22,498 (13.4 to 191,001 for the first six months of fiscal 2025 from 168,503 for the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to operating 93 more stores than a year ago. 
 Interest, net increased by 1,819 (7.3 to 26,620 for the first six months of fiscal 2025 from 24,801. The increase was primarily attributable to decrease in interest income due to the decrease in average cash and cash equivalents from the same period in the prior year. 
 The effective tax rate increased to 24.3 in the first six months of the fiscal year compared to 23.6 in the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to one-time benefits in the prior year from adjusting the Company s deferred tax assets and liabilities for state law changes enacted during the year. 
 Net income increased by 33,097 (10.1 to 361,116 from 328,019 in the prior year.

See discussion in the paragraphs above for the primary drivers for each of these changes. 
 
 Use of Non-GAAP Measures 
 We define EBITDA as net income before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is not considered to be a GAAP measure, and should not be considered as a substitute for net income, cash flows from operating activities or other income or cash flow statement data. This measure has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. We strongly encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. 
 We believe EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance because securities analysts and other interested parties use this calculation as a measure of financial performance and debt service capabilities, and it is regularly used by management for internal purposes including our capital budgeting process, evaluating acquisition targets, assessing performance, and awarding incentive compensation. 
 Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, EBITDA, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. It therefore may not be possible to compare our use of this non-GAAP financial measure with those used by other companies. 
 The following table contains a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA for the three and six months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023: 
 Three months ended Six months ended October 31, 2024 October 31, 2023 October 31, 2024 October 31, 2023 Net income 180,918 158,782 361,116 328,019 Interest, net 12,553 12,306 26,620 24,801 Federal and state income taxes 58,817 49,172 115,925 101,434 Depreciation and amortization 96,592 85,598 191,001 168,503 EBITDA 348,880 305,858 694,662 622,757 
 For the three and six months ended October 31, 2024, EBITDA increased by 14.1 and 11.5 , respectively, when compared to the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily attributable to higher profitability both inside the store and in fuel , partially offset by higher operating expenses. See discussion in the preceding sections for the primary drivers for each of these individual changes. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 Critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that management believes are important to the portrayal of the Company s financial condition and results of operations. The Company's critical accounting policies are described in the Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2024, and such discussion is incorporated herein by reference. There have been no changes to these policies in the six months ended October 31, 2024.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Due to the nature of the Company s business, cash provided by operations is the Company s primary source of liquidity. The Company finances its inventory purchases primarily from normal trade credit aided by the relatively rapid turnover of inventory. This turnover allows the Company to conduct its operations without large amounts of cash and working capital. As of October 31, 2024, the Company s ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 0.88 to 1. The ratio at October 31, 2023 and April 30, 2024 was 1.06 to 1 and 0.87 to 1, respectively. The decrease in the ratio from October 31, 2023, is primarily due to the timing of debt payments, with an increase in current maturities of long-term debt and finance lease obligations associated with the reclassification of the 150,000 Series E notes from long-term debt and finance lease obligations to current maturities, as the full principal balance is coming due June 13, 2025. 
 Management believes that the net availability under the Bank Line of approximately 49,692 and the Revolving Facility of 850,000, combined with the current cash and cash equivalents and the future cash flow from operations will be sufficient to satisfy the working capital needs of our business. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 552,057 for the six months ended October 31, 2024, compared to 481,780 for the comparable period in the prior year, an increase of 70,277. Our primary source of operating cash flows is from sales to guests at our stores. The primary uses of operating cash flows are payments to our team members and suppliers, as well as payments for taxes and interest. Cash flow from operations was favorably impacted by improved revenue less cost of goods sold (excluding depreciation and amortization) of 150,500, offset by an increase in operating expenses of 78,595. Refer to "Six Months Ended October 31, 2024 Compared to Six Months Ended October 31, 2023" starting on page 16 for further details on the primary drivers for the changes in revenue, cost of goods sold, and operating expenses. Additionally, cash paid for income taxes increased by 46,470 from the prior year, driven primarily by the decrease in accelerated tax depreciation on acquisitions and capital expenditures during the 2025 fiscal year compared to the 2024 fiscal year. Cash flows from operations can also be impacted by variability in the timing of payments and receipts for certain assets and liabilities, such as wage related accruals, accounts payable, and receivables from credit card companies or our vendors. The increase in operating cash flows, compared to the prior year, was also favorably impacted by an increase in operating cash flows of 35,991 due to the timing of inventory purchases. 
 Cash used in investing activities decreased 61,176. During the first six months of fiscal 2025, the Company expended 257,567 for purchases of property and equipment and payments for acquisitions compared to 315,314 for the comparable period in the prior year. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was largely attributable to a decrease in acquisition related activity compared to the prior year. Purchases of property and equipment and payments for acquisitions of businesses typically represent the single largest use of excess Company funds. Management believes that by acquiring, building, and reinvesting in stores, the Company will be better able to drive long-term shareholder value. 
 Cash provided by financing increased 1,142,884, from the comparable period of the prior year, primarily due to the proceeds from long-term debt of 1,100,000, incurred on October 30, 2024, to fund the Fikes acquisition, which closed subsequent to quarter end on November 1, 2024. The proceeds have been recognized as restricted cash within long-term assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of October 31, 2024. As a result, the proceeds do not impact the current ratios discussed above. For additional information, please refer to Note 4 and Note 9 . Additionally, cash provided by financing was positively impacted by a decrease in share repurchase related activity of 58,757.

 850,000 Less debt issuance costs (6,411) 2,707,480 Less current maturities (245,558) 2,461,922 
 The Company has funded purchases of property and equipment and payments for acquisitions of businesses primarily from the issuance of debt, existing cash, and funds generated from operations. Future capital needs required to finance operations, improvements and the anticipated growth in the number of stores are expected to be met from cash generated by operations, the Revolving Facility, the Bank Line, and additional long-term debt or other securities as circumstances may dictate, and are not expected to adversely affect liquidity.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk . 
 The Company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and floating rate long-term debt obligations. We place our investments with high-quality credit issuers and, by policy, limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our first priority is to attempt to reduce the risk of principal loss. Consequently, we seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk, and reinvestment risk. We attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in only high-quality credit securities that we believe to be low risk and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. Based upon the outstanding balance of the Company's term loan facilities as of October 31, 2024, an immediate 100-basis-point move in interest rates would have an approximate annualized impact of 10.6 million on interest expense. 
 The Company also has exposure to market risks related to the volatility of fuel prices associated with non-store inventoried fuel (pipeline and terminal). The Company utilizes futures contracts to economically hedge the physical products while the bulk fuel is in storage at various terminals and pipelines, until such time the underlying gallons can be delivered to the store. The Company does not speculate in trading financial instruments. All hedges must be matched against recorded physical transactions, inventoried fuel in a pipeline or at a terminal. Derivative contracts outstanding were immaterial to the financial statements as of October 31, 2024 and for the period then ended. 
 We do from time to time, participate in a forward buy of certain commodities. These contracts are not accounted for as derivatives as they meet the normal purchases exclusion under derivative accounting. 
 
 Item 4 . Controls and Procedures . 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 240.13a-15(e)). Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s current disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended October 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
