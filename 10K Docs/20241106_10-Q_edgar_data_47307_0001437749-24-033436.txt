million, substantially all of which was recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

The Company purchased substantially all of the assets of Crawford SEP Acquisition Company LLC (name later changed to Sepa r America LLC or Separ America ), in Davie, Florida on January 10, 2022. Separ America develops, designs, manufactures, sells and distributes oil change systems, fuel and oil transfer pumps, fuel primers, fuel polishing systems and engine flushing systems. The company purchased substantially all of the assets of KMC Corp. dba Knitting Machinery Corp. Knitting Machinery ), in Cleveland, Ohio and Greenville, Ohio on May 1, 2022. Knitting Machinery specializes in manufacturing hose reinforcement machinery for the plastic, rubber and silicone industries. The Company purchased substantially all of the assets of Heany in Scottsville, New York on January 2, 2024. Heany is a specialist in materials engineering solutions for a variety of aerospace, industrial and bio-medical applications. The Company purchased substantially all of the assets of AIC in Stockton, California on August 30, 2024. AIC is a specialist in fluoropolymers and other high-performance coatings solutions for the aerospace, semiconductor, medical, energy and other industrial sectors . 
 
 The factors used to determine the Company s reportable segments follow the guidance of ASC 280 - 10 - 50 - 21 and 50 - 10 - 22 and include consideration of the type of products or services delivered, the customers and end markets served, the appliable revenue recognition methodology and the length of time it takes to deliver products or services to customers. The Commercial Air Handling Equipment segment was identified as a reportable segment consisting of Air Enterprises, because Air Enterprises is strategically and operationally different from our other companies in several ways. First, Air Enterprises sells equipment to end customers and our other businesses that fall into the Industrial and Transportation Products segment sell products, components and coatings to end customers, not equipment. Second, the Commercial Air Handling Equipment segment delivers custom air handling solutions to customers which is different than the Industrial and Transportation Products segment which delivers manufactured metal, silicone, hydraulic and marine hoses, complex engineered components and coatings, highly engineered forgings, highly engineered and machined parts and data analytic technology applications. Third, the Commercial Air Handling Equipment segment serves customers primarily in the health care and education end markets while the Industrial and Transportation Products segment delivers products to customers in the heavy-duty truck manufacturing, agricultural, industrial, petrochemical, aerospace, defense, industrial gas turbine, medical prosthetics, alternative energy and emergency vehicle end markets. Fourth, the Commercial Air Handling Equipment segment recognizes revenue primarily over time while the Industrial and Transportation Products segment recognizes revenue primarily at a point in time. Fifth, the Commercial Air Handling Equipment segment manufactures custom air handling solutions for customers over a period of three to twenty-four months from the time the order is received to the time the air handling solution is delivered to the end customer as compared to the Industrial and Transportation Products segment which sells and delivers products to customers much more quickly, often within 30 days or less. For the reasons previously mentioned, Air Enterprises is strategically and operationally different than the other businesses owned by the Company and management finds it useful to include this business in the Commercial Air Handling Segment which is separate and distinct from all of our other businesses that reside in the Industrial and Transportation Products segment.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS 
 OF OPERATIONS. 
 
 The following discussion is intended to assist in the understanding of the Company's financial position at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, results of operations for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and within the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 The Company purchased substantially all of the operating assets of Advanced Industrial Coatings, Inc. ("AIC") located in Stockton, California on August 30, 2024.

Conversely, our results for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2023 do not include Heany and AIC.

 Sales for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 current quarter increased to 36.7 million, an increase of 3.1 million or 9.2 from sales of 33.6 million during the same quarter of the prior year. The increase in sales for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by an increase in volume in the Company's Commercial Air Handling Segment offset by a small decrease in volume in the Company's Industrial and Transportation Product Segment. The overall increase in volume can be attributed to the increased demand for air handling units. Further insights into the performance of each segment are provided in the detailed discussions that follow. 
 
 Cost of sales for the current quarter was 26.0 million compared to 24.7 million for the same quarter of the prior year, a slight increase of 1.3 million, or 5.3 , which is attributable to the increase in sales. Gross margin of 29.1 in the current quarter increased from 26.5 in the same quarter of the prior year. T he margin improvement is due to a greater proportion of sales coming from our growing Commercial Air Handling segment which operates at higher margins, coupled with manufacturing efficiencies in that segment, which allowed for improved absorption of fixed costs. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG A) in the current quarter were 5.4 million, compared to 4.6 million, in the same quarter of the prior year. This marginal increase in SG A expenses, which remained stable as a percentage of our total sales, is primarily due to the acquisition of Heany and AIC during the first and third quarters of 2024, respectively, as well as other strategic investments in talent aimed at managing and supporting the Company's growth. 
 
 Interest charges in the current quarter were 0.3 million compared to 0.3 million in the same quarter of the prior year. Average total debt outstanding has decreased, but interest rates have increased slightly leading to interest expense remaining flat. Average total debt (including notes) and average interest rates for the current quarter were 13.6 million and 7.1 , respectively, compared to 15.4 million and 7.0 , respectively, in the same period of last year. 
 
 The gain on investment in the current quarter was immaterial . Additionally, during the current quarter the Company sold its remaining stock investment in another public company for proceeds of 0.1 million. T he loss on investment in the prior year quarter of 0.1 million is attributed to market price change impacting the Company's stock investment. 
 
 The Company had other expense of 0.3 million in the current quarter, primarily resulting from fees related to the acquisition of AIC. The Company had an immaterial amount of other expense for the same quarter of the prior year. 
 
 Income tax expense in the current quarter was 1.3 million compared to 1.1 million in the same quarter of the prior year. Income tax expense is higher compared to the same quarter of the prior year primarily because of higher pre-tax income. 
 
 Net income in the current quarter was 3.4 million, or 0.95 per diluted share, as compared to net income of 2.8 million, or 0.80 per diluted share, for the same quarter of the prior year because of the factors noted above. 
 
 Commercial Air Handling Segment 
 
 Sales in the Commercial Air Handling Equipment segment for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 increased to 15.9 million, an increase of approximately 3.2 million, or 25.2 , from sales of 12.7 million during the same period of the prior year. The consistent growth in reported sales in this segment highlights our sustained momentum in meeting the rising demand for clean air solutions. 
 
 Segment operating profit in the Commercial Air Handling Equipment segment for the current quarter was 4.9 million, or 31.0 , compared to 3.3 million, or 26.2 in the same quarter of the prior year, an increase of 1.6 million or 480 basis points. This enhancement in segment operating profit and margin can be attributed to the expanded revenue base, which facilitates more efficient absorption of fixed costs. Another supporting factor of the improved margins has been the continued implementation of various efficiency and continuous improvement initiatives within our manufacturing processes. These strategic measures have further optimized operations and bolstered profitability. The segment's SG A costs remained materially consistent compared to the same quarter of the prior year. 
 
 Industrial and Transportation Products Segment 
 
 Sales in the Industrial and Transportation Products segment for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were 20.8 million, a slight decrease of approximately 0.1 million, or 0.5 , from sales of 20.9 million during the same period of the prior year. The decrease in the current quarter was primarily the result of decreased demand for marine products, which was mostly offset by sales from our acquisitions of Heany and AIC of approximately 1.9 million. The decrease in marine products sales volume can be attributed to the cyclical nature of recreational boating demand whereby there was a pandemic-driven surge in demand lasting through the third quarter of 2023. By design, this segment is diversified and operates across several industries. 
 
 Segment operating profit in the Industrial and Transportation Products segment for the current quarter was 1.5 million, or 7.2 , compared to 1.9 million, or 9.3 , in the same quarter of the prior year, a decrease of 0.5 million or 220 basis points. As sales have remained flat despite the two acquisitions completed in 2024, the decrease in operating profit margin can mainly be attributed to the operating costs of the two new entities, Heany and AIC. Many of the underlying expenses within this segment are fixed in the short-term and our ability to absorb fixed cost has been negatively impacted. In response, we have implemented several strategic initiatives aimed at mitigating the effects on our margin and cash flows. These include optimizing our production processes to enhance efficiency and reduce costs, renegotiating supplier contracts to secure more favorable terms, and intensifying our focus on inventory management to minimize excess inventory.

Results of Operations Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 current year-to-date period increased to 112.8 million, a modest increase of 2.8 million or 2.5 from sales of 110.1 million during the same period of the prior year. The increase in sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by an increase in volume in the Company's Commercial Air Handling Segment partially offset by a decrease in volume in the Company's Industrial and Transportation Product Segment. The overall increase in volume can largely be attributed to the macroeconomic trend of increased demand for air handling units being partially offset by decreased demand within the boating market. Further insights into the performance of each segment are provided in the detailed discussions that follow. 
 
 Cost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 remained flat at 81.5 million compared to 80.2 million for the same period of the prior year. Gross margin of 27.8 in the current year-to-date period exceeds 27.2 in the same period of the prior year . The gross margin improvement is largely due to a greater proportion of sales coming from the Commercial Air Handling segment which operates at higher margins. 
 
 SG A expenses in the current year-to-date period were 16.4 million, compared to 15.3 million, in the same period of last year. SG A costs have risen compared to the prior year period as we have strategically increased our investment in talent to support growth. 
 
 Interest charges in the current year-to-date period were 0.8 million compared to 1.0 million in the same period of the prior year. Average total debt outstanding has decreased, which has been partially offset by rising interest rates. Average total debt (including notes) and average interest rates for the current year-to-date period were 13.9 million and 7.1 , respectively, compared to 19.3 million and 6.7 , respectively, in the same period of last year. 
 
 The loss on investment in the current year-to-date period was 0.4 million due to changes in the market value of the Company's stock investment in another public company. Additionally, during the current year-to-date period the Company sold its remaining stock investment for proceeds of 0.3 million. The loss on investment in the same period of the prior year was immaterial. 
 
 The Company recognized other expense of 0.4 million in the current year-to-date period, resulting from fees related to the purchases of Heany Industries, Inc and Advanced Industrial Coatings, Inc. The Company had other income of 0.3 million for the same period of the prior year, resulting from incentives that Global-Tek received from the government of Puerto Rico that did not recur in the current year-to-date period. 
 
 Income tax expense in the current year-to-date period was 3.8 million compared to 3.8 million in the same year-to-date period of the prior year. Despite the 0.5 million decrease in pre-tax net income, income tax expense remained flat compared to the same period of the prior year as a result of a smaller proportion of pre-tax net income being generated in Puerto Rico, which has a lower tax rate. 
 
 Net income in the current year-to-date period was 9.6 million, or 2.72 per diluted share, as compared to net income of 10.1 million, or 2.86 per diluted share, for the same period of the prior year because of the factors noted above. 
 
 Commercial Air Handling Segment 
 
 Sales in the Commercial Air Handling Equipment segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 49.3 million, an increase of approximately 5.7 million, or 13.1 , from sales of 43.6 million during the same period of the prior year. The consistent growth in reported sales in this segment highlights our sustained momentum in meeting the rising demand for clean air solutions. 
 
 Segment operating profit in the Commercial Air Handling Equipment segment for the current year-to-date period was 14.2 million, or 28.7 compared to 10.7 million, or 24.6 in the same period of the prior year, an increase of 3.4 million or 410 basis points. This enhancement in segment operating profit and margin can be attributed to the expanded revenue base, which facilitates more efficient absorption of fixed costs. Another supporting factor of the improved margins has been the continued implementation of various efficiency and continuous improvement initiatives within our manufacturing processes. These strategic measures have further optimized operations and bolstered profitability. The segment's SG A costs have remained materially consistent compared to the first nine months of the prior year. 
 
 Industrial and Transportation Products Segment 
 
 Sales in the Industrial and Transportation Products segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 63.5 million, a decrease of approximately 3.0 million, or 4.4 , from sales of 66.4 million during the same period of the prior year. The decrease in the current year-to-date period was primarily the result of decreased demand in the marine products, machined defense parts , and forged aerospace products businesses of approximately 9.2 million, being partially offset by sales from our acquisitions of Heany and AIC of approximately 4.8 million and increased sales in our machined aerospace parts business of 1.4 million . By design, this segment is diversified and operates across several industries. The decrease in marine sales volume can be attributed to the cyclical nature of recreational boating demand whereby there was a pandemic-driven surge in demand lasting through the third quarter of 2023. The other declines in machine defense parts and forgings are a result of two specific customers placing a pause on orders that we expect will be temporary and eventually return back to previous levels. 
 
 Segment operating profit in the Industrial and Transportation Products segment for the current year-to-date period was 4.7 million, or 7.3 , compared to 7.7 million, or 11.7 , in the same period of the prior year, a decrease of 3.1 million or 430 basis points. As sales have decreased and many of the underlying expenses are fixed in the short-term, our ability to absorb fixed cost has been negatively impacted. In response, we have implemented several strategic initiatives aimed at mitigating the effects on our gross margin. These include optimizing our production processes to enhance efficiency and reduce costs and renegotiating supplier contracts to secure more favorable terms. The segment's SG A costs have risen compared to the prior year period as we have strategically increased our investment in talent to support growth.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 The Company s credit agreement, by and among the Company, its subsidiaries and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as lender (as amended, the Credit Agreement ), provides for a revolving credit facility of up to 30.0 million. At September 30, 2024, there was approximately 24.2 million of borrowing availability, which has decreased in the current year-to-date period as the Company borrowed cash to fund the acquisitions of Heany Industries, Inc and Advanced Industrial Coatings, Inc. 
 
 Operating Activities . T he dynamics of cash flows from operating activities are subject to variability, influenced by the oscillating demands of working capital and the scheduling of payment cycles . Net cash provided by operating activities was 13.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to 11.0 million net cash provided by operating activities for the same period of the prior year. While billing timing results in largely offsetting fluctuations in several items in the statement of cash flows, the improvement in cash flow from operations can be attributed to partnering with our vendors to better align our payment terms with that of our customers. 
 
 Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 12.6 million, compared to cash used in investing activities of 1.4 million in the same period of the prior year. Cash used in investing activities for the period ended September 30, 2024 was primarily for the acquisitions of Heany and AIC, the purchase of the property in Phoenix in which CAD operates, and routine capital expenditures. Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was for capital expenditures in the normal course of business. 
 
 Financing Activities. Cash used in financing activities was approximately 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to cash used in financing activities of 9.3 million in the same period last year. During the current year-to-date period the Company borrowed on its revolving credit facility to fund the acquisitions noted above. In the first nine months of the prior year the Company utilized cash flow from operations to pay down debt. 
 
 The Company is actively managing its business to generate cash flow. We believe that cash and availability on our revolving credit facility to be sufficient to fund working capital needs and service principal and interest payments due related to the bank debt and notes payable for at least the next 12 months. Based on a combination of sustained profitability and significant borrowing capacity, the Company believes it is well positioned to support ongoing operations as well as growth initiatives. Notwithstanding the Company's expectations, if the Company's operating results decrease as the result of pressures on the business due to, for example, supply chain interruptions or delays, increases in material, freight or labor costs, inflationary pressures, currency or interest rate fluctuations, lost customers, regulatory issues, a downturn in general economic conditions, or the Company's failure to execute its business plans, the Company may require additional financing, or may be unable to comply with its obligations under the credit facility, and its lenders could demand repayment of any amounts outstanding under the Company s credit facility. See Notes 8 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the Company's total debt. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 From time to time, the Company enters into performance and payment bonds in the ordinary course of business. These bonds are secured by certain assets of the Company until the Company s completion of certain contractual requirements. At September 30, 2024, the Company had no secured performance and payment bonds as surety on completion of the requirements of certain commercial air handling contracts. The Company has no other off-balance sheet arrangements (as defined in Regulation S-K Item 303 paragraph (a)(4)(ii)) that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditure or capital resources.) 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 Preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions which affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that are used to prepare financial statements. Management has made their best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. We do not believe that there is great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions related to the accounting policies described below. However, application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. 

21

Certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below. On a regular basis, critical accounting policies are reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 
 
 Revenue Recognition : We recognize revenue with respect to customer orders when our obligations under the contract terms are satisfied and control of the product transfers to the customer, typically upon shipment. Revenue from certain contracts in the Commercial Air Handling Equipment segment is accounted for over time, when products are manufactured or services are performed, as control transfers under these arrangements. We follow a cost-based input method, since there is no objective output measure that would fairly depict the transfer of control over the life of the performance obligation. Progress on the performance obligation is measured by the proportion of actual costs incurred to the total costs expected to complete the contract. Costs included in the measure of progress include direct labor and third-party. This cost-based method of revenue recognition requires the Company to make estimates of costs to complete its projects on an ongoing basis. Significant judgment is required to evaluate assumptions related to these estimates. The effect of revisions to estimates related to the transaction price or costs to complete a project are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis. Certain contracts may be terminated by the customer; however, in the event of termination, most contracts require payment for services rendered through the date of termination. 
 
 Allowance for Obsolete and Slow-Moving Inventory : Inventories are valued using the first-in, first-out FIFO method; stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value; and are reduced by an allowance for obsolete and slow-moving inventories. The allowance is estimated based on management s review of inventories on hand with minimal sales activity, which is compared to estimated future usage and sales. Inventories identified by management as slow-moving or obsolete are reserved for based on estimated selling prices less disposal costs. Though we consider these allowances adequate and proper, changes in economic conditions in specific markets in which we operate could have a material effect on allowances required. 
 
 Business Combinations : Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting under ASC 805, Business Combinations. This method requires the Company to record assets and liabilities of the businesses acquired at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair value requires management to make estimates and assumptions including discount rates, rates of return on assets, and long-term sales growth rates. 
 
 Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets : As referenced by ASC 350 Intangibles- Goodwill and other ASC 350 ), management performs its impairment test for goodwill and intangible assets at least annually or more frequently, if impairment indicators arise at the reporting unit level. Our reporting units have been identified at the individual company component level, with each individual subsidiary operating company constituting its own reporting unit. For 2023, management performed a qualitative assessment over all reporting units other than CAD, which indicated there were no indicators of impairment. A quantitative impairment analysis was done for CAD which concluded that goodwill and intangible assets were not impaired. 
 
 Our goodwill impairment analysis utilizes a qualitative approach that compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. To the extent that the qualitative approach indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount is less than the reporting unit's fair value, we apply a quantitative approach as a secondary step. In applying the quantitative approach, we use an income approach to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. The income approach uses a number of factors, including future business plans and actual and forecasted operating results. The significant assumptions employed under this method include discount rates; revenue growth rates, including assumed terminal growth rates; and operating margins used to project future cash flows for the operating company. The discount rates utilized reflect market-based estimates of capital costs and discount rates adjusted for management s assessment of a market participant s view with respect to other risks associated with the projected cash flows of the individual company. Our estimates are based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which by nature are uncertain and unpredictable. We believe we incorporate reasonable assumptions into our analysis of goodwill impairment testing for a reporting unit, such that actual experience would need to be materially out of the range of expected assumptions in order for an impairment to remain undetected. 

22

During 2023, revenue at CAD increased from 15.5 million in 2022 to 20.9 million. The revenue growth was 35 and was consistent with the quantitative modeling done in 2022. However despite the strong revenue growth, CAD did not meet the profitability projections used in the prior year's quantitative goodwill analysis. Accordingly, we noted a triggering event and completed a Step 1 quantitative analysis as of December 31, 2023. The quantitative assessment of CAD Enterprises confirmed that the estimated fair value exceeded carrying value by 35 , and thus no impairment existed at December 31, 2023. The key assumptions used to estimate fair value included discount rates; revenue growth rates, including assumed terminal growth rates; and after-tax income margins used to project future cash flows for CAD Enterprises. The discount rate used to estimate fair value was 15 and was based on estimates of capital costs and management s assessment of a market participant s view with respect to other risks associated with the projected cash flows for CAD Enterprises. The increase from the prior year reflects the incremental company specific risks related to the missed profitability projections in 2023. Our revenue growth rate for the 7-year period in the discounted cash flow model was 7.7 per year, which reflects management s assessment of estimated future orders for CAD Enterprises based in part on a Long-Term-Agreement LTA with the company s largest customer, inclusive of an expected increase in volume, our previous revenue history including actual revenues exceeding 30 million prior to the recent inflationary environment, and growth in the aerospace industry stemming from post-pandemic travel rebound, geopolitical conflicts and private space exploration. The assumed terminal growth rate for CAD Enterprises was 3 based on management s assessment of long-term growth rates for the Aerospace industry. The after-tax income margins used to project future margins for the company reflect that most of CAD's non-material costs are fixed, and as revenue grows, much of the growth will fall-through to the bottom line. 
 
 Our estimates are based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which by nature are uncertain and unpredictable. Potential events and circumstances including global conflicts, materials shortages, inability to increase prices to keep pace with expenses, onset of a global pandemic, departure of key employees and loss of a key customer could negatively affect the key assumptions used for the recent fair value test and are similar to the risk factors noted in Item 1A, Risk Factors in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Income Taxes : In accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes ASC 740 ), we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates. Specifically, we measure gross deferred tax assets for deductible temporary differences and carryforwards, such as operating losses and tax credits, using the applicable enacted tax rates and apply the more likely than not measurement criterion. Further, at each interim reporting period, we estimate an effective income tax rate that is expected to be applicable for the full year. Significant judgment is involved regarding the application of income tax laws and regulations and when projecting the jurisdictional mix of income. Additionally, interpretation of tax laws, court decisions or other guidance provided by taxing authorities influences our estimate of the effective income tax rates. As a result, our actual annual effective income tax rates and related income tax liabilities may differ materially from our interim estimated effective tax rates and related income tax liabilities. Any resulting differences are recorded in the period they become known. 

23

Impact of Inflation 
 Inflationary economic conditions during the past few years have increased the Company s costs (including labor) of producing its products. While many of the inflationary conditions have stabilized, inflationary economic conditions persist or worsen and may be impactful going forward. The Company s products are manufactured using various metals and other commodity-based materials including steel, aluminum, rubber and silicone. Freight and labor costs also are significant elements of the Company s production costs. Inflationary economic conditions have elevated these and personnel costs. If the Company is unable to continue mitigating cost increases through customer pricing actions, alternative supply arrangements or other cost reduction initiatives, the Company's profitability may be adversely affected.

I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Crawford United Corporation (the "registrant"); 

2. 

Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;

4. 

The registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 

a) Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 

b) Designed such internal controls over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

5. 

The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 

a) All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 

b) Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
