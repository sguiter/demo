 Available for sale securities are evaluated to determine if a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis has resulted from a credit loss or from other factors. An impairment related to credit factors would be recorded through an allowance for credit losses. The allowance is limited to the amount by which the security s amortized cost basis exceeds the fair value. An impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses shall be recorded through other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. Investment securities will be written down to fair value through the Consolidated Statement of Income if management intends to sell, or may be required to sell, the securities before they recover in value. The issuers of these securities continue to make timely principal and interest payments and none of these securities were past due or were placed in nonaccrual status at September 30, 2024. The Company also monitors the credit quality of the issuers through credit ratings from various rating agencies. Credit ratings express opinions about the credit quality of a security and are utilized by the Company to make informed decisions. Management believes that the unrealized losses on these securities are a function of changes in market interest rates and credit spreads, not changes in credit quality. allowance for credit losses was recorded at September 30, 2024 on available for sale securities. 
 At September 30, 2024, the held to maturity securities portfolio consists of agency mortgage-backed securities and obligations of state and political subdivisions. The mortgage-backed securities are issued by U.S. government agencies and are implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government. The obligations of state and political subdivisions in the portfolio are highly rated by major rating agencies and have a long history of no credit losses. The Company regularly monitors the obligations of state and

 Nonperforming Loans 
 Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when contractual payments become 90 or more days past due or when the Company does not expect to receive all principal and interest payments owed substantially in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement, regardless of past due status. Loans that become 90 days or more past due, but are well secured and in the process of collection, may remain on accrual status. Nonaccrual loans are generally returned to accrual status when all payments due are brought current and the Company expects to receive all remaining principal and interest payments owed substantially in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement. Payments received in cash on nonaccrual loans, including both the principal and interest portions of those payments, are generally applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan. The Company did t recognize interest income on non-accrual loans during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 For collateral dependent loans where management has determined that foreclosure of the collateral is probable, or where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment of the loan is to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, the allowance for credit losses is measured based on the difference between the fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell, and the amortized cost basis of the loan as of the measurement date.

 Credit Quality Indicators 
 The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes loans individually to classify the loans as to credit risk. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: 
 Pass Loans that are well protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor (or guarantors, if any) or by the fair value, less cost to acquire and sell, of any underlying collateral in a timely manner. 
 Special Mention Loans which do not currently expose the Company to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant an adverse classification but have some credit deficiencies or other potential weaknesses. 
 Substandard Loans which are inadequately protected by the paying capacity and net worth of the obligor or the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 
 Doubtful Loans which have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified as Substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values. 
 Loss Loans which are considered uncollectible or of so little value that their continuance as assets is not warranted.

 Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 
 The Company s uses derivatives to add stability to interest expense and interest income and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. The Company has entered into interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and an interest rate floor as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. These interest rate products are designated as cash flow hedges. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a total of interest rate swaps and caps with a total notional amount of billion hedging specific wholesale funding and interest rate floors with a notional amount of million hedging floating-rate available for sale securities. 
 For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in other comprehensive income, net of tax, and subsequently reclassified into interest expense in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. 
 For cash flow hedges on the Company s wholesale funding positions, amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company s hedged variable rate wholesale funding positions. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reclassified million as a reduction in interest expense. During the next twelve months, the Company estimates that million will be reclassified as a reduction in interest expense. 
 For cash flow hedges on the Company s assets, amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest income as interest payments are received on the Company s hedged variable rate assets. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not reclassify any amount to interest income. During the next twelve months, the Company estimates that million will be reclassified as a reduction in interest income.) Amount of gain reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest expense 
 Fair Value Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 
 The Company is exposed to changes in the fair value of certain of its fixed-rate assets due to changes in benchmark interest rates. The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to changes in fair value on these instruments attributable to changes in the designated benchmark interest rate. Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges involve the payment of fixed-rate amounts to a counterparty in exchange for the Company receiving variable-rate payments over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. Such derivatives are used to hedge the changes in fair value of certain of its pools of fixed rate assets. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million hedging fixed-rate residential mortgage loans. 
 For derivatives designated and that qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivatives as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in interest income.

By comparison, at June 30, 2024, collateral dependent loans valued using Level 3 inputs comprised loans with principal balances totaling million and a valuation allowance of reflecting an aggregate fair value of million. 
 Once a loan is foreclosed, the fair value of the other real estate owned continues to be evaluated based upon the fair value of the repossessed real estate originally securing the loan. At September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the Company had other real estate owned assets, respectively.

 Commitments. The fair value of commitments to fund credit lines and originate or participate in loans held in portfolio or loans held for sale is estimated using fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties. For fixed rate loan commitments, including those relating to loans held for sale that are considered derivative instruments for financial statement reporting purposes, the fair value also considers the difference between current levels of interest and the committed rates. The carrying value, represented by the net deferred fee arising from the unrecognized commitment, and the fair value, determined by discounting the remaining contractual fee over the term of the commitment using fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements with similar credit risk, is not considered material for disclosure. 
 Limitations. Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time based on relevant market information and information about the financial instruments. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the entire holdings of a particular financial instrument. Because no fair value exists for a significant portion of the financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature, involve uncertainties and matters of judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. 
 The fair value estimates are based on existing on-and-off balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to value anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments. Other significant assets and liabilities that are not considered financial assets and liabilities include premises and equipment, and advances from borrowers for taxes and insurance. In addition, the ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in any of the estimates. 
 Finally, reasonable comparability between financial institutions may not be likely due to the wide range of permitted valuation techniques and numerous estimates which must be made given the absence of active secondary markets for many of the financial instruments. This lack of uniform valuation methodologies introduces a greater degree of subjectivity to these estimated fair values.

Such forward-looking statements may be identified by reference to a future period or periods or by the use of forward-looking terminology, such as may , will , believe , expect , estimate , anticipate , continue , or similar terms or variations on those terms, or the negative of those terms. The actual results of the Company could differ materially from those management expectations. This includes statements regarding general economic conditions, legislative and regulatory changes, monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government, changes in tax policies, rates and regulations of federal, state and local tax authorities and failure to integrate or profitably operate acquired businesses. Additional potential factors include changes in interest rates, the rate of inflation, deposit flows, cost of funds, demand for loan products and financial services, competition and changes in the quality or composition of loan and investment portfolios of the Company. Other factors that could cause future results to vary from current management expectations include changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines, and other economic, competitive, governmental and technological factors affecting the Company s operations, markets, products, services and prices. Further description of the risks and uncertainties to the business are included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024, under Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Except as required by applicable law or regulation, the Company does not undertake, and specifically disclaims any obligation, to release publicly the result of any revisions that may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of the statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 Our accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported. We consider accounting policies that require management to exercise significant judgment or discretion or to make significant assumptions that have, or could have, a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income to be critical accounting policies. At September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies as compared to the critical accounting policies disclosed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. Reference is made to Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024. 
 
 Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 
 Executive Summary. Total assets increased 88.9 million to 7.77 billion at September 30, 2024 from 7.68 billion at June 30, 2024. The increase primarily reflected increases in cash and cash equivalents and in net loans receivable, partially offset by decreases in the market values of interest rate derivatives and a decrease in Federal Home Loan Bank of New York FHLB capital stock. 
 Investment Securities. Investment securities available for sale decreased 2.0 million to 1.07 billion at September 30, 2024, from 1.07 billion at June 30, 2024. This decrease was largely the result of principal repayments of 63.6 million, partially offset by purchases of 37.5 million and a 23.9 million increase in the fair value of the portfolio to a net unrealized loss of 106.8 million. 
 Investment securities held to maturity decreased 3.5 million to 132.3 million at September 30, 2024 from 135.7 million at June 30, 2024. This decrease was driven by principal repayments of 3.5 million. 
 Additional information regarding our investment securities at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 is presented in Note 4 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements. 
 Loans Held-for-Sale. Loans held-for-sale totaled 8.9 million at September 30, 2024 as compared to 6.0 million at June 30, 2024 and are reported separately from the balance of net loans receivable. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 26.6 million of residential mortgage loans, resulting in a gain on sale of 200,000.

 Net Loans Receivable. Net loans receivable increased 51.5 million, or 0.9 , to 5.74 billion at September 30, 2024 from 5.69 billion at June 30, 2024. Details regarding the change in the loan portfolio, by loan segment, are presented below:

 Commercial loan origination volume for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 85.2 million, comprised of 37.3 million of commercial mortgage loan originations, 29.7 million of commercial business loan originations and construction loan disbursements of 18.2 million. 
 One- to four-family residential mortgage loan origination volume, excluding loans held-for-sale, totaled 50.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Home equity loan and line of credit origination volume for the same period totaled 4.6 million. 
 Loan-to-value LTV ratios are based on current period loan balances and original appraised values at the time of origination unless a current appraisal has been obtained as a result of the loan being deemed collateral dependent and individually analyzed. The following table sets forth the composition of our real estate secured loans indicating the LTV, by loan category, at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024:

 Nonperforming Assets. Nonperforming assets remained steady at 39.9 million, or 0.51 of total assets, at September 30, 2024, and 39.9 million, or 0.52 of total assets, at June 30, 2024, respectively. 
 Additional information about our nonperforming loans and loan modifications at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 is presented in Note 5 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses ACL ). At September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the ACL totaled 44.9 million, or 0.78 of total loans. The ACL for the three months ended September 30, 2024 reflected net charge-offs of 124,000, partially offset by a provision for credit losses of 108,000. The provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by an increase in the balance of loans receivable. 
 Additional information about our ACL at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 is presented in Note 6 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements. 
 Other Assets. The aggregate balance of other assets, including premises and equipment, Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB stock, interest receivable, goodwill, core deposit intangibles, bank owned life insurance BOLI ), deferred income taxes, and other assets, decreased 51.6 million to 665.5 million at September 30, 2024 from 717.1 million at June 30, 2024. The decrease in the balance of these other assets during the three months ended September 30, 2024 largely reflected a decrease in the market value of interest rate derivatives and a decrease in FHLB stock, partially offset by an increase in BOLI. The remaining change generally reflected normal operating fluctuations within these line items. 
 Deposits. Total deposits increased 312.4 million, or 6.1 , to 5.47 billion at September 30, 2024 from 5.16 billion at June 30, 2024. Included in total deposits are brokered time deposits of 733.3 million at September 30, 2024 and 408.2 million at June 30, 2024. This increase was largely the result of a reallocation from FHLB advances into brokered certificates of deposits, due to the relatively more favorable economics of brokered deposits compared to advances in the current economic environment. The following table sets forth the distribution of, and changes in, deposits, by type, for the periods indicated: 
 September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 Increase/ (Decrease) (In Thousands) Non-interest-bearing deposits 592,099 598,366 (6,267) Interest-bearing deposits: Interest-bearing demand 2,247,685 2,308,915 (61,230) Savings 681,709 643,481 38,228 Certificates of deposit (retail) 1,215,746 1,199,127 16,619 Certificates of deposit (brokered) 733,273 408,234 325,039 Interest-bearing deposits 4,878,413 4,559,757 318,656 Total deposits 5,470,512 5,158,123 312,389 
 Uninsured deposits totaled 1.80 billion as of September 30, 2024 compared to 1.77 billion as of June 30, 2024. Excluding collateralized deposits of state and local governments, and deposits of the Bank s wholly-owned subsidiary and holding company, uninsured deposits totaled 773.4 million, or 14.1 of total deposits, at September 30, 2024 compared to 764.4 million, or 14.8 of total deposits, at June 30, 2024. 
 Additional information about our deposits at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 is presented in Note 7 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements. 
 Borrowings. The balance of borrowings decreased by 229.9 million to 1.48 billion at September 30, 2024 from 1.71 billion at June 30, 2024, primarily reflecting a decrease in FHLB borrowings offset by an increase in brokered certificates of deposits, as noted above. 
 At September 30, 2024, we maintained available secured borrowing capacity with the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Discount Window of 2.06 billion, an increase of 240.0 million from June 30, 2024, and represents 26.5 of total assets. 
 Additional information about our borrowings at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 is presented in Note 8 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements. 
 Other Liabilities. The balance of other liabilities, including advance payments by borrowers for taxes and other miscellaneous liabilities, increased 8.5 million to 70.4 million at September 30, 2024 from 62.0 million at June 30, 2024. The change in the balance of these other liabilities generally reflected normal operating fluctuations during the period.

 Stockholders Equity. Stockholders equity decreased 2.0 million to 751.5 million at September 30, 2024 from 753.6 million at June 30, 2024. The decrease in stockholders equity during the three months ended September 30, 2024 largely reflected cash dividends of 6.9 million and an other comprehensive loss of 1.6 million, partially offset by net income of 6.1 million. The other comprehensive loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by a decrease in the fair value of our derivatives portfolio, partially offset by an increase in the fair value of our available for sale securities. 
 Book value per share decreased by 0.06 to 11.64 at September 30, 2024 while tangible book value per share decreased by 0.05 to 9.85 at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Comparison of Operating Results for the Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 Net Income . Net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 6.1 million, or 0.10 per diluted share, compared to 9.8 million, or 0.16 per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net income reflected a decrease in net interest income, partially offset by an increase in non-interest income and decreases in income tax expense and the provision for credit losses. 
 Net Interest Income . Net interest income decreased by 6.7 million to 32.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to 39.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease between the comparative periods resulted from an increase of 8.8 million in interest expense, partially offset by an increase of 2.1 million in interest income. Included in net interest income for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, was purchase accounting accretion of 649,000 and 650,000, and loan prepayment penalty income of 52,000 and 267,000. 
 Net interest margin decreased 30 basis points to 1.80 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, from 2.10 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 reflecting an increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing borrowings and a decrease in the average balance of interest-earning assets, partially offset by an increase in the yield on interest-earning assets and a decrease in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits.

 Details regarding the composition of, and changes to, net interest income are presented in the table below which reflects the components of the average balance sheet and of net interest income for the periods indicated. We derived the average yields and costs by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the periods presented with daily balances used to derive average balances. No tax equivalent adjustments have been made to yield or costs. Non-accrual loans were included in the calculation of average balances, however interest receivable on these loans has been fully reserved for and therefore not included in interest income. The yields and costs set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or expense.

 Provision for Credit Losses . The provision for credit losses decreased 137,000 to 108,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 245,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The provision for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by loan growth compared to previous quarter end loan balances. By comparison, the provision for credit losses for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 was largely driven by additional reserves provided for individually analyzed loans and a slower prepayment rate assumption, partially offset by a decrease in the balance of loans receivable. 
 Additional information regarding the ACL and the associated provisions recognized during the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is presented in Note 6 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements as well as the Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024. 
 Non-Interest Income . Total non-interest income increased 616,000 to 4.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. 
 Income from BOLI increased 901,000 to 2.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by improved income resulting from the BOLI restructure initiated in December 2023. 
 Fees and service charges decreased 113,000 to 635,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The decrease primarily reflected decreases in various loan-related fees and charges. 
 Other non-interest income decreased 181,000 to 833,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in other non-interest income was primarily driven by the absence of OREO income recorded in the current period due to the sale of our sole OREO asset in January 2024. 
 The remaining changes in the other components of non-interest income between comparative periods generally reflected normal operating fluctuations within those line items. 
 Non-Interest Expense . Total non-interest expense remained flat at 29.8 million for the quarter ending September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023. 
 Salaries and employee benefits decreased 263,000 to 17.5 million for quarter ended September 30, 2024. This decrease was primarily driven by a non-recurring decrease in stock-based compensation and lower incentive compensation, partially offset by annual merit increases and higher payroll taxes. 
 Equipment and systems expense increased 59,000 to 3.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, largely driven by increases in technology expense associated with the Company s ongoing digital banking initiatives. 
 Advertising and marketing expense increased 114,000 to 342,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, largely driven by an increase in digital and online advertising campaigns to support our deposit growth initiatives. 
 Other non-interest expense increased 55,000 to 3.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. This increase reflected an increase in the provision for credit losses on off balance sheet commitments, offset by a decrease in OREO expenses following the sale of a our sole OREO asset in January 2024. 
 The remaining changes in the other components of non-interest expense between comparative periods generally reflected normal operating fluctuations within those line items. 
 Provision for Income Taxes . Provision for income taxes decreased 2.2 million to 1.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 from 3.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. 
 The decrease in income tax expense reflected a lower level of pre-tax income compared to the prior period. 
 Effective tax rates for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 15.1 and 25.2 , respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to lower full year projected taxable income and an increase in non-taxable BOLI income compared to the prior year period.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity, represented by cash and cash equivalents, is a product of operating, investing and financing activities. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, borrowings, cash flows from investment securities and loans receivable and funds provided from operations. While scheduled payments from the amortization and maturity of loans and investment securities are relatively predictable sources of funds, general interest rates, economic conditions and competition greatly influence deposit flows and prepayments on loans and securities. 
 At September 30, 2024, liquidity included 155.6 million of short-term cash and cash equivalents and 1.07 billion of investment securities available for sale. As of September 30, 2024, we had the capacity to borrow additional cash funds totaling 2.06 billion and 663.9 million from the FHLBNY and the Federal Reserve discount window, respectively, without pledging additional collateral. We had the ability to pledge additional securities to borrow an additional 62.8 million at September 30, 2024. As of that same date, we also had access to unsecured overnight borrowings with other financial institutions totaling 920.0 million of which 270.0 million was outstanding. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had outstanding commitments to originate and purchase loans totaling 52.2 million while such commitments totaled 47.9 million at June 30, 2024. As of those same dates, our pipeline of loans held for sale included 17.8 million and 16.0 million, respectively, of loans in process whose terms included interest rate locks to borrowers that were paired with a best-efforts commitment to sell the loan to a buyer at a fixed price and within a predetermined timeframe after the sale commitment is established. 
 Construction loans in process and unused lines of credit were 117.4 million and 154.1 million, respectively, at September 30, 2024 compared to 75.7 million and 157.3 million, respectively, at June 30, 2024. We are also subject to the contingent liabilities resulting from letters of credit whose outstanding balances totaled 160,000 at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. 
 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee by the customer. Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit is represented by the contractual notional amount of those instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on-balance-sheet instruments. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. 
 Consistent with its goals to operate a sound and profitable financial organization, the Bank actively seeks to maintain its status as a well-capitalized institution in accordance with regulatory standards. 
 The following table sets forth the Bank s capital position at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, as compared to the minimum regulatory capital requirements that were in effect as of those dates:

 In March 2020, the federal banking agencies announced an interim final rule to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital stemming from the implementation of CECL. The interim final rule provides banks the option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL s effect on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss method, followed by a three-year transition period established in the previous rule (five-year transition option). We have adopted the capital transition relief over the permissible five-year period. The two-year delay ended for us as of June 30, 2022 and we then began the three-year transition period. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 In the normal course of our business of investing in loans and securities we are a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk. These financial instruments include significant purchase commitments, such as commitments related to capital expenditure plans and commitments to extend credit to meet the financing needs of our customers. We had no significant off-balance sheet commitments for capital expenditures as of September 30, 2024.

 ITEM 3. 
 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 The majority of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates and as such, interest rate risk is a significant form of market risk that we must manage. Interest rate risk is generally defined in regulatory nomenclature as the risk to earnings or capital arising from the movement of interest rates and arises from several risk factors including re-pricing risk, basis risk, yield curve risk and option risk. We maintain an Asset/Liability Management ALM program in order manage our interest rate risk. The program is overseen by the Board of Directors through its Interest Rate Risk Management Committee which has assigned the responsibility for the operational aspects of the ALM program to our Asset/Liability Management Committee ALCO ), which is comprised of various members of the senior and executive management team. 
 The quantitative analysis that we conduct measures interest rate risk from both a capital and earnings perspective. With regard to earnings, movements in interest rates and the shape of the yield curve significantly influence the amount of net interest income NII that we recognize. Movements in market interest rates, and the effect of such movements on the risk factors noted above, significantly influence the spread between the interest earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest paid on our interest-bearing liabilities. Our internal interest rate risk analysis calculates the sensitivity of our projected NII over a one year period utilizing a static balance sheet assumption through which incoming and outgoing asset and liability cash flows are reinvested into similar instruments. Product pricing and earning asset prepayment speeds are appropriately adjusted for each rate scenario. 
 With regard to capital, our internal interest rate risk analysis calculates the sensitivity of our Economic Value of Equity EVE to movements in interest rates. EVE represents the present value of the expected cash flows from our assets less the present value of the expected cash flows arising from our liabilities adjusted for the value of off-balance sheet instruments. EVE attempts to quantify our economic value using a discounted cash flow methodology. The degree to which our EVE changes for any hypothetical interest rate scenario from its base case measurement is a reflection of our sensitivity to interest rate risk. 
 For both earnings and capital at risk, our interest rate risk analysis calculates a base case scenario that assumes no change in interest rates. The model then measures changes throughout a series of interest rate scenarios representing immediate and permanent, parallel shifts in the yield curve up and down 100, 200 and 300 basis points with additional scenarios modeled where appropriate. The model requires that interest rates remain positive for all points along the yield curve for each rate scenario which may preclude the modeling of certain falling rate scenarios during periods of lower market interest rates. 
 The following tables present the results of our internal EVE and NII analyses as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively: 
 September 30, 2024 1 to 12 Months 13 to 24 Months Change in Interest Rates EVE Change in EVE NII Change in NII NII Change in NII (Dollars in Thousands) +300 bps 337,481 (41.13) 130,861 (7.30) 137,642 (11.30) +200 bps 409,658 (28.54) 133,714 (5.28) 142,909 (7.91) +100 bps 493,835 (13.86) 137,077 (2.90) 149,484 (3.67) 0 bps 573,301 141,164 155,178 -100 bps 642,587 12.09 145,963 3.40 161,207 3.89 -200 bps 688,422 20.08 147,303 4.35 163,562 5.40 -300 bps 750,729 30.95 149,611 5.98 166,197 7.10

Table of Contents 

 There are numerous internal and external factors that may contribute to changes in our EVE and its sensitivity. Changes in the composition and allocation of our balance sheet, or utilization of off-balance sheet instruments such as derivatives, can significantly alter the exposure to interest rate risk as quantified by the changes in the EVE sensitivity measures. Changes to certain external factors, most notably changes in the level of market interest rates and overall shape of the yield curve, can also alter the projected cash flows of our interest-earning assets and interest-costing liabilities and the associated present values thereof. 
 Notwithstanding the rate change scenarios presented in the EVE and NII-based analyses above, future interest rates and their effect on net interest income are not predictable. Computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions, including relative levels of market interest rates, prepayments and deposit run-offs and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. Certain shortcomings are inherent in this type of computation. Although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of re-pricing, they may react at different times and in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. The interest rate on certain types of assets and liabilities, such as demand deposits and savings accounts, may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in market interest rates. Certain assets, such as adjustable-rate mortgages, generally have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. In the event of a change in interest rates, prepayments and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in the analyses set forth above. Additionally, an increase in credit risk may result as the ability of borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase. 
 
 ITEM 4.
