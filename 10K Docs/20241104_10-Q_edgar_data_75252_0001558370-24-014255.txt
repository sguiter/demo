 Interest expense, net The amount of ineffectiveness associated with these contracts was immaterial for the periods presented. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a gain of million and a loss of million associated with our economic (non-designated) foreign currency contracts. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized losses of million and million associated with our economic (non-designated) foreign currency contracts. We recorded the change in fair value of derivative instruments and the remeasurement adjustment of the foreign currency denominated asset or liability in other operating expense, net for our foreign exchange contracts. and ) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to and in the same periods of 2023. The change in these rates for the three month periods resulted primarily from changes in results of operations in the jurisdictions in which we operate and the incremental tax benefit recorded for foreign derived intangible income in the third quarter of 2023. The change in these rates for the nine month periods resulted primarily from remeasurement of our uncertain tax positions, as described below, as well as the factors described for the three month periods. On August 26, 2020, we received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (NOPA) from the IRS regarding our 2015 and 2016 consolidated income tax returns. On June 30, 2021, we received a NOPA from the IRS regarding our 2017 and 2018 consolidated income tax returns. Within the NOPAs, the IRS has asserted that our taxable income for the aforementioned years should be higher based on their assessment of the appropriate amount of taxable income that we should report in the United States in connection with our sourcing of products by our foreign subsidiaries for sale in the United States by our domestic subsidiaries. The transfer pricing methodology was consistently applied for all years subject to the NOPAs and 2019 into 2022, but is no longer employed. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, the IRS and the relevant foreign taxing authority mutually agreed to proposed adjustments to our 2015 through 2018 consolidated tax returns. This was communicated to us in late June 2024. As a result, we remeasured the uncertain tax position for the 2015 through 2018 tax years, as well as the affected 2019 through 2022 tax years, to the amount expected to be paid upon a final agreement with the IRS. This matter does not impact our 2023, 2024 or future tax years. The total change in estimate, net of an income tax benefit from the foreign taxing authority, is million, or impact per basic and diluted common share, including million of interest, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and is reflected within the income tax provision on our consolidated statements of operations. The total change in estimate reflects an increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of million recorded within other current liabilities, partially offset by a million increase in the receivable from the foreign taxing authority recorded within other current assets, on our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2024. The balance sheet classification and amount owed may be subject to change depending on the timing of a final agreement with the IRS. Excluding the impact of million of interest, there has been no change in estimate for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for disclosure of other material contractual obligations. We are party to various legal claims that are ordinary and incidental to our business, including ones related to commercial disputes, employment, workers compensation, product liability, regulatory and other matters. We maintain insurance coverage for employment, product liability, workers compensation and other personal injury litigation matters, subject to policy limits, applicable deductibles and insurer solvency. We establish reserves from time to time based upon periodic assessment of the potential outcomes of pending matters. Based on current knowledge and the advice of counsel, we believe that the accrual as of September 30, 2024 for currently pending matters considered probable of loss, which is not material, is sufficient. In addition, we believe that other currently pending matters are not reasonably possible to result in a material loss, as payment of the amounts claimed is remote, the claims are immaterial, individually and in the aggregate, or the claims are expected to be adequately covered by insurance, subject to policy limits, applicable deductibles, exclusions and insurer solvency. On July 22, 2024, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger to acquire Rotech for billion in cash.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis describes results of operations and material changes in the financial condition of Owens Minor, Inc. and its subsidiaries since December 31, 2023. Trends of a material nature are discussed to the extent known and considered relevant. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, related notes thereto, and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Overview Owens Minor, Inc., along with its subsidiaries, (we, us, or our) is a global healthcare solutions company. Our business has two distinct segments: Products Healthcare Services and Patient Direct. Products Healthcare Services provides distribution, outsourced logistics and value-added services, and manufactures and sources medical surgical products through our production and kitting operations. The Patient Direct segment includes our home healthcare divisions (Byram and Apria). On July 22, 2024, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger to acquire Rotech Healthcare Holdings Inc., (Rotech) for 1.36 billion in cash. Given anticipated tax benefits of approximately 40 million from the transaction, the net purchase price is approximately 1.32 billion. Rotech is a national leader in providing home medical equipment in the US. The definitive agreement contains certain termination rights for the Company and Rotech. In the event that we terminate the contract, we will be required to pay Rotech a termination fee of 70.0 million. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart Scott Rodino Act, and is expected to close in the first half of 2025. We have fully committed financing in place and expect to use a combination of cash and incremental borrowings to fund the purchase price. Net (loss) per share was (0.17) and (0.87) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to net (loss) per share of (0.08) and (0.78) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year periods were impacted by the following: (1) a decline in operating income of our Products Healthcare Services segment as described below; (2) 10.0 million of expense primarily for a legal settlement and related charges for a compensation dispute, partially offset by (3) an increase in operating income by our Patient Direct segment as described below; (4) a decline in intangible amortization of 6.2 million; and (5) a decline in interest expense of 1.6 million. Our financial results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year periods were impacted by the following: (1) the remeasurement of an uncertain tax position, including interest which resulted in a 17.9 million, or (0.23) income tax charge per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (see Note 8 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); (2) legal settlements of 16.7 million related primarily to compensation and wage and hour disputes and (3) a 10.7 million increase in exit and realignment charges, net partially offset by (4) operating income increases in both of our segments as described below; (5) a decline in interest expense of 12.9 million; and (6) a decline in intangible amortization of 11.5 million. Net (loss) per share was favorably impacted as compared to the prior year by foreign currency translation in the amount of 0.02 and 0.01 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Products Healthcare Services operating income was 4.2 million and 27.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 19.8 million and 24.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decline for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to (1) a 10.3 million increase in last in, first out (LIFO) charges, (2) 4.6 million of unfavorable changes in foreign currency transaction gains and losses, net of derivative adjustments, as compared to the prior year and (3) costs to support future revenue growth partially offset by (4) revenue growth of 4.7 and (5) approximately 11 million of savings derived

 sourcing initiatives and other operating efficiencies . The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to revenue growth of 4.0 and savings derived by our sourcing initiatives of approximately 26 million, partially offset by a 14.2 million increase in LIFO charges, increased costs to support future revenue growth, and approximately 8 million of increased teammate benefit costs. Patient Direct operating income was 79.9 million and 191 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 64.4 million and 169 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. This segment s results reflect revenue growth of 5.9 and 5.1 and cost savings from information technology (IT) strategic initiatives and other operating efficiencies. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a 5.1 million gain from an agreement with Philips Respironics (Philips) for previously recalled equipment, which was partially offset by unfavorable changes in revenue mix and approximately 15 million of increased teammate benefit costs. Refer to Results of Operations for further detail of quantitative and qualitative drivers of our results. Philips Respironics Recall In June 2021, one of Apria s suppliers, Philips, announced a voluntary recall of its continuous and non-continuous ventilators (certain continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bilevel positive airway pressure and ventilator devices) related to polyurethane foam used in those devices, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) identified as a Class I recall, the most serious category of recall. In December 2022, Philips issued a subsequent voluntary recall related to deficiencies in repairs made to certain of the ventilators that had originally been recalled in June 2021 (together with the June 2021 recall, the Recall). In April 2024, Philips entered into a consent decree enjoining Philips from making and distributing non-medically necessary CPAP, bilevel positive airway pressure and ventilator devices at any of its Sleep and Respiratory Care Business facilities until the FDA determines that Philips has complied with the remediation and compliance activities set forth in the consent decree. We continue to closely monitor the impact of the Recall and subsequent consent decree on our business. To date, we have incurred significant costs coordinating Recall-related activities, and we may continue to incur additional significant costs (including costs in completing the replacement of devices subject to the Recall). Some or all of these costs may not be recoverable from the product manufacturer. During the second quarter, we reached an agreement with Philips requiring Philips to pay us for recalled equipment returned to Philips. Refer to the Overview section for details of the impacts to our statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we received 17.1 million from Philips which was recorded in the other, net line item within investing activities of the consolidated statements of cash flows. The corresponding gain of 5.1 million on the returned equipment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is reflected in the gain on sales and dispositions of property and equipment line item within operating activities of the consolidated statements of cash flows. While we believe we have access to a sufficient supply of CPAP, bilevel positive airway pressure and ventilator devices to service our home healthcare patients needs, other supply chain disruptions may have a future material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.

The Receivables Financing Agreement matures in March 2025. We had no borrowings at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 under our Receivables Financing Agreement. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had maximum revolving borrowing capacity of 450 million under our Receivable Financing Agreement. The Revolving Credit Agreement provides a revolving borrowing capacity of 450 million. We have 870 million in outstanding term loans under a term loan credit agreement (the Credit Agreement). The interest rate on our Revolving Credit Agreement is based on a spread over a benchmark rate (as described in the Revolving Credit Agreement). The Revolving Credit Agreement matures in March 2027. The interest rate on the Term Loan A is based on either the Term SOFR or the Base Rate plus an Applicable Rate which varies depending on the current Debt Ratings or Total Leverage Ratio, determined as to whichever shall result in more favorable pricing to the Borrowers (each as defined in the Credit Agreement). The interest rate on the Term Loan B is based on either the Term SOFR or the Base Rate plus an Applicable Rate. The Term Loan A matures in March 2027 and the Term Loan B matures in March 2029. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our Revolving Credit Agreement was undrawn, and we had letters of credit, which reduce Revolver availability, totaling 31.5 million and 27.4 million, leaving 419 million and 423 million available for borrowing at the end of each period. We also had letters of credit and bank guarantees which support certain leased facilities as well as other normal business activities in the United States and Europe that were issued outside of the Revolving Credit Agreement for 3.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. On March 29, 2022, we entered into a Security Agreement Supplement pursuant to which the Security and Pledge Agreement (the Security Agreement), dated March 10, 2021 was supplemented to grant collateral on behalf of the holders of the 2024 Notes, and the parties secured under the credit agreements including first priority liens and security interests in (a) all present and future shares of capital stock owned by the Grantors (as defined in the Security Agreement) in the Grantors present and future subsidiaries, subject to certain customary exceptions, and (b) all present and future personal property and assets of the Grantors, subject to certain exceptions. On September 16, 2024, we redeemed all of our outstanding 2024 Notes, see Note 5 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Revolving Credit Agreement, the Credit Agreement, the Receivables Financing Agreement, the 4.500 senior unsecured notes due in March 2029, and the 6.625 senior unsecured notes due in April 2030 contain cross-default provisions which could result in the acceleration of payments due in the event of default of any of the related agreements. The terms of the applicable credit agreements also require us to maintain ratios for leverage and interest coverage, including on a pro forma basis in the event of an acquisition or divestiture. We were in compliance with our debt covenants at September 30, 2024. On March 14, 2023, we entered into the RPA, pursuant to which accounts receivable with an aggregate outstanding amount not to exceed 200 million are sold, on a limited-recourse basis, to a third-party financial institution (the Purchaser) in exchange for cash. Cash received from the sales of accounts receivable, net of payments made to the Purchaser, is reflected in the change in accounts receivable within cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Total accounts receivable sold under the RPA were 542 million and 1.6 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, 

 30 

Table of Contents 
 we received net cash proceeds of 538 million and 1.6 billion from the sale of accounts receivable under the RPA and collected 550 million and 1.6 billion of the sold accounts receivable. Total accounts receivable sold under the RPA were 482 million and 894 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we received net cash proceeds of 478 million and 888 million from the sale of accounts receivable under the RPA and collected 508 million and 805 million of the sold accounts receivable. No accounts receivables were sold under the RPA for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The losses on sale of accounts receivable, inclusive of professional fees incurred to establish the agreement, recorded in other operating expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations were 3.6 million and 3.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and 10.8 million and 7.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The RPA is separate and distinct from the accounts receivable securitization program (the Receivables Financing Agreement). We regularly evaluate market conditions, our liquidity profile and various financing alternatives to enhance our capital structure. We have from time to time, entered into, and from time to time in the future, we may enter into transactions to repay, repurchase or redeem our outstanding indebtedness (including by means of open market purchases, privately negotiated repurchases, tender or exchange offers and/or repayments or redemptions pursuant to the debt s terms). Our ability to consummate any such transaction will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. We cannot provide any assurance as to if or when we will consummate any such transactions or the terms of any such transaction. We believe cash generated by operating activities, including available cash proceeds from the RPA, available financing sources, and borrowings under the Receivables Financing Agreement and Revolving Credit Agreement, as well as cash on hand, will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, long-term strategic growth, payments under long-term debt and lease arrangements, debt repurchases and other cash requirements. While we believe that we will have the ability to meet our financing needs in the foreseeable future, changes in economic conditions may impact (i) the ability of financial institutions to meet their contractual commitments to us, (ii) the ability of our customers and suppliers to meet their obligations to us or (iii) our cost of borrowing. We earn a portion of our operating income in foreign jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries subject to repatriation totaled 22.2 million and 22.0 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we are permanently reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries. Contractual Obligations Commitments include 48.4 million of legally binding lease payments for the Morgantown, West Virginia center of excellence for medical supplies and logistics lease signed, but not yet commenced. Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for disclosure of other material contractual obligations.

Based upon that evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period of this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Part II. Other Information Item 1. Legal Proceedings Certain legal proceedings pending against us are described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Through September 30, 2024, there have been no material developments in any legal 

 33 

Table of Contents 
 proceedings reported in such Annual Report, other than as described in Management s Discussion a nd Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Item 1A. Risk Factors The following description of risk factors updates and supplements risk factors associated with our business previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. These risk factors are in addition to those mentioned in other parts of this report and are not all of the risks that we face. We could also be affected by risks that we currently are not aware of or that we currently do not consider material to our business. We cannot assure you that the proposed acquisition of Rotech (Rotech Acquisition) will be completed. There are a number of risks and uncertainties relating to the Rotech Acquisition. For example, the Rotech Acquisition may not be completed, or may not be completed in the timeframe, on the terms or in the manner currently anticipated, as a result of a number of factors, including, among other things, the failure of one or more of the conditions to closing in the Agreement and Plan of Merger. There can be no assurance that the conditions to closing of the Rotech Acquisition will be satisfied or waived or that other events will not intervene to delay or result in the failure to close the Rotech Acquisition. The Agreement and Plan of Merger may be terminated by the parties thereto under certain circumstances, including, without limitation, if the Rotech Acquisition has not been completed by July 22, 2025. Any delay in closing the Rotech Acquisition or a failure to close the Rotech Acquisition could have a negative impact on our business and the trading prices of our common stock and debt. We may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Rotech Acquisition or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. We may also encounter significant difficulties in integrating the Rotech business into our operations. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Rotech Acquisition will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate the Rotech business into ours. We may devote significant management attention and resources preparing for and then integrating the business practices and operations of the Rotech business with ours. This integration process may be disruptive to our and the Rotech businesses, and, if implemented ineffectively, could restrict realization of the expected benefits. In addition, we may fail to realize some of the anticipated benefits of the Rotech Acquisition if the integration process takes longer than expected or is more costly than expected. Potential difficulties we may encounter in the integration process include: The inability to successfully combine operations in a manner that would result in the anticipated benefits of the Rotech Acquisition in the time frame currently anticipated or at all; Complexities associated with managing the expanded operations; Integrating personnel; Creation of uniform standards, internal controls, procedures, policies and information systems; Unforeseen increased expenses, delays or regulatory issues associated with integrating the operations; and Performance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management attention caused by completing the integration of the operations. Even if we are able to integrate the Rotech business successfully, this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits that we currently expect, nor can we give assurances that these benefits will be achieved when expected or at all. Moreover, the integration of the Rotech business may result in unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, regulatory risks and competitive responses that could have material adverse consequences. We and the Rotech business will be subject to business uncertainties while the Rotech Acquisition is pending that could adversely affect our business and the Rotech business. Uncertainty about the effect of the Rotech Acquisition on teammates, customers and suppliers may have an adverse effect on us and the Rotech business. Although we and Rotech intend to take actions to reduce any adverse effects, these uncertainties could cause customers, suppliers and others that deal with us and/or the Rotech business to seek to change existing business relationships. In addition, teammate retention could be negatively impacted during the 

 34 

Table of Contents 
 pendency of the Rotech Acquisition. If key teammates depart because of concerns relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of the integration process, our business could be harmed. The pendency of the Rotech Acquisition could adversely affect our business, financial results, and operations. The announcement and pendency of the Rotech Acquisition could cause disruptions and create uncertainty surrounding our business and affect our relationships with our customers, suppliers and teammates. In addition, we have diverted, and will continue to divert, significant management resources to complete the Rotech Acquisition, which could have a negative impact on our ability to manage existing operations or pursue alternative strategic transactions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Investor perceptions about the terms or benefits of the Rotech Acquisition could have a negative impact on our business and the trading prices of our common stock and debt. Despite current indebtedness levels, we will incur substantially more debt to complete the acquisition of Rotech. We and our subsidiaries will incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future in order to complete the Rotech Acquisition, which could significantly increase our leverage. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face to service debt levels and the risks associated with failure to adequately service our debt could intensify. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Use of Proceeds and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities None. Item 5. Other Information. On October 11, 2024, the Company and Rotech each received a request for additional information and documentary materials from the Federal Trade Commission (the FTC) in connection with the FTC s review of the Merger. The effect of a Second Request is to extend the waiting period imposed by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, until 30 days after each of the Company and Rotech has substantially complied with the Second Request issued to it, unless that period is extended voluntarily by the parties or terminated earlier by the FTC. Completion of the Rotech Acquisition remains subject to the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act and the satisfaction or waiver of the other closing conditions specified in an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement). The Company continues to work constructively with the FTC in its review of the Merger and expects that the Merger will be completed in the first half of 2025, subject to satisfaction or waiver of the closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, of or informed us of the adoption or termination of a tradin g plan intended to satisfy Rule 10b5-1(c).
