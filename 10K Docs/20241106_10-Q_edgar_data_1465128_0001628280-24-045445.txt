 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking statements, including without limitation, statements concerning our operations, economic performance and financial condition. These forward-looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of their respective dates. 
 These forward-looking statements are based largely on our current beliefs, assumptions and expectations of our future performance taking into account all information currently available to us. These beliefs, assumptions and expectations can change as a result of many possible events or factors, not all of which are known to us or within our control, and which could materially affect actual results, performance or achievements. Factors that may cause actual results to vary from our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: 
 factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including those set forth under the captions Risk Factors , Business and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 defaults by borrowers in paying debt service on outstanding indebtedness; 
 impairment in the value of real estate property securing our loans or in which we invest; 
 availability of mortgage origination and acquisition opportunities acceptable to us; 
 potential mismatches in the timing of asset repayments and the maturity of the associated financing agreements; 
 our ability to achieve the benefits that we anticipate from the prior acquisition of the project finance origination, underwriting and capital markets business of GE Capital Global Holdings, LLC; 
 national and local economic and business conditions, including as a result of the impact of public health emergencies; 
 the occurrence of certain geo-political events (such as wars, terrorist attacks and tensions between states) that affect the normal and peaceful course of international relations; 
 general and local commercial and residential real estate property conditions; 
 changes in federal government policies; 
 changes in federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations; 
 increased competition from entities engaged in mortgage lending and securities investing activities;

 Real estate commercial and residential lending (the Commercial and Residential Lending Segment engages primarily in originating, acquiring, financing and managing commercial first mortgages, non-agency residential mortgages residential loans ), subordinated mortgages, mezzanine loans, preferred equity, commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS ), residential mortgage-backed securities RMBS and other real estate and real estate-related debt investments in the U.S., Europe and Australia (including distressed or non-performing loans). Our residential loans are secured by a first mortgage lien on residential property and primarily consist of non-agency residential loans that are not guaranteed by any U.S. Government agency or federally chartered corporation. 
 Infrastructure lending (the Infrastructure Lending Segment engages primarily in originating, acquiring, financing and managing infrastructure debt investments. 
 Real estate property (the Property Segment engages primarily in acquiring and managing equity interests in stabilized and to be stabilized commercial real estate properties, including multifamily properties, that are held for investment. 
 Real estate investing and servicing (the Investing and Servicing Segment includes (i) a servicing business in the U.S. that manages and works out problem assets, (ii) an investment business that selectively acquires and manages unrated, investment grade and non-investment grade rated CMBS, including subordinated interests of securitization and resecuritization transactions, (iii) a mortgage loan business which originates conduit loans for the primary purpose of selling these loans into securitization transactions and (iv) an investment business that selectively acquires commercial real estate assets, including properties acquired from CMBS trusts. 
 Our segments exclude the consolidation of securitization variable interest entities VIEs ). 
 We are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a real estate investment trust REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). As such, we will generally not be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on that portion of our net income that is distributed to stockholders if we distribute at least of our taxable income to our stockholders by prescribed dates and comply with various other requirements. 
 We are organized as a holding company and conduct our business primarily through our various wholly-owned subsidiaries. We are externally managed and advised by SPT Management, LLC (our Manager pursuant to the terms of a management agreement. Our Manager is controlled by Barry Sternlicht, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

of our consolidated securitization VIE assets, with the remaining representing loans. However, it is important to note that the fair value of our securitization VIE assets is determined by reference to our securitization VIE liabilities as permitted under ASU 2014-13, Consolidation (Topic 810): Measuring the Financial Assets and the Financial Liabilities of a Consolidated Collateralized Financing Entity . In other words, our VIE liabilities are more reliably measurable than the VIE assets, resulting in our current measurement methodology which utilizes this value to determine the fair value of our securitization VIE assets as a whole. As a result, these percentages are not necessarily indicative of the relative fair values of each of these asset categories if the assets were to be valued individually. 
 Due to our accounting policy election under ASU 2014-13, separately presenting two different asset categories would result in an arbitrary assignment of value to each, with one asset category representing a residual amount, as opposed to its fair value. However, as a pool, the fair value of the assets in total is equal to the fair value of the liabilities. 
 For these reasons, the assets of our securitization VIEs are presented in the aggregate. 
 reinvestment is permitted, and there is no active management of the underlying assets. In determining the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the securitization VIEs, we maximize the use of observable inputs over unobservable inputs. Refer to Note 20 for further discussion regarding our fair value measurements.

Investments of Consolidated Affordable Housing Fund 
 On November 5, 2021, we established Woodstar Portfolio Holdings, LLC (the Woodstar Fund ), an investment fund which holds our Woodstar multifamily affordable housing portfolios consisting of properties with units located in Central and South Florida. As managing member of the Woodstar Fund, we manage interests purchased by third party investors seeking capital appreciation and an ongoing return, for which we earn (i) a management fee based on each investor s share of total Woodstar Fund equity; and (ii) an incentive distribution if the Woodstar Fund s returns exceed an established threshold. In connection with the establishment of the Woodstar Fund, we entered into subscription and other related agreements with certain third party institutional investors to sell, through a feeder fund structure, an aggregate interest in the Woodstar Fund for an initial aggregate subscription price of million, which was adjusted to million post-closing. The Woodstar Fund has an initial term of . 
 
 Effective with the third party interest sale, the Woodstar Fund has the characteristics of an investment company under ASC 946, Financial Services Investment Companies. Accordingly, the Woodstar Fund is required to carry the investments in its properties at fair value, with a cumulative effect adjustment between the fair value and previous carrying value of its investments recognized in stockholders equity as of November 5, 2021, the date of the Woodstar Fund s change in status to an investment company. Because we are the primary beneficiary of the Woodstar Fund, which is a VIE (as discussed in Note 15), we consolidate the accounts of the Woodstar Fund into our consolidated financial statements, retaining the fair value basis of accounting for its investments. Realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of the Woodstar Fund s property investments, and distributions thereon, are recognized in the Income from affordable housing fund investments caption within the other income (loss) section of our condensed consolidated statements of operations. See Note 7 for further details regarding the Woodstar Fund s investments and related income and Note 17 with respect to its contingently redeemable non-controlling interests which are classified as Temporary Equity in our condensed consolidated balance sheets.

 Credit Loss Allowances 
 As discussed in Note 2, we do not have a history of realized credit losses on our HFI loans and HTM securities, so we have subscribed to third party database services to provide us with industry losses for both commercial real estate and infrastructure loans. Using these losses as a benchmark, we determine expected credit losses for our loans and securities on a collective basis within our commercial real estate and infrastructure portfolios. 
 For our commercial loans, we utilize a loan loss model that is widely used among banks and commercial mortgage REITs and is marketed by a leading CMBS data analytics provider. It employs logistic regression to forecast expected losses at the loan level based on a commercial real estate loan securitization database that contains activity dating back to 1998. We provide specific loan-level inputs which include loan-to-stabilized-value LTV and debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) metrics, as well as principal balances, property type, location, coupon, origination year, term, subordination, expected repayment dates and future fundings. We also select from a group of independent five-year macroeconomic forecasts included in the model that are updated regularly based on current economic trends. We categorize the results by LTV range, which we consider the most significant indicator of credit quality for our commercial loans, as set forth in the credit quality indicator table below. A lower LTV ratio typically indicates a lower credit loss risk. 
 The macroeconomic forecasts do not differentiate among property types or asset classes. Instead, these forecasts reference general macroeconomic conditions (i.e. Gross Domestic Product, employment and interest rates) which apply broadly across all assets. For instance, although the office sector has been adversely affected by the increase in remote working arrangements and the retail sector has been adversely affected by electronic commerce, the broad macroeconomic forecasts do not account for such differentiation. Accordingly, we have selected more adverse macroeconomic recovery forecasts related to office and retail properties than for other property types in determining our credit loss allowance.

 Loan Modifications 
 We may amend or modify a loan based on its specific facts and circumstances. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made modifications to the commercial loans described below, which are disclosable under ASU 2022-02, Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures , as they involved an other-than-insignificant payment delay and/or an interest rate reduction for a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. The loans had a combined amortized cost basis of billion, representing of our commercial loans as of September 30, 2024. These types of modifications generally provide a borrower additional time to refinance or sell the collateral property in order to repay the principal balance of the loan and/or provide some interest payment relief to a borrower experiencing operating cash shortfalls. The modified terms and subsequent performance of the modified loans were included in the determination of our general CECL reserve.

 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were and securities, respectively, with unrealized losses reflected in the table above. After evaluating the securities, we concluded that the unrealized losses reflected above were noncredit-related and would be recovered from the securities estimated future cash flows. We considered a number of factors in reaching this conclusion, including that we did not intend to sell the securities, it was not considered more likely than not that we would be forced to sell the securities prior to recovering our amortized cost, and there were no material credit events that would have caused us to otherwise conclude that we would not recover our cost. Credit losses, if any, are calculated by comparing (i) the estimated future cash flows of each security discounted at the yield determined as of the initial acquisition date or, if since revised, as of the last date previously revised, to (ii) our net amortized cost basis. Significant judgment is used in projecting cash flows for our non-agency RMBS. As a result, actual income and/or credit losses could be materially different from what is currently projected and/or reported. 
 
 CMBS and RMBS, Fair Value Option 
 As discussed in the Fair Value Option section of Note 2 herein, we elect the fair value option for certain CMBS and RMBS in an effort to eliminate accounting mismatches resulting from the current or potential consolidation of securitization VIEs. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value and unpaid principal balance of CMBS where we have elected the fair value option, excluding the notional value of interest-only securities and before consolidation of securitization VIEs, were billion and billion, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value and unpaid principal balance of RMBS where we have elected the fair value option, excluding the notional value of interest-only securities and before consolidation of securitization VIEs, were million and million, respectively. The billion total fair value balance of CMBS and RMBS represents our economic interests in these assets. However, as a result of our consolidation of securitization VIEs, the vast majority of this fair value (all except million at September 30, 2024) is eliminated against VIE liabilities before arriving at our GAAP balance for fair value option investment securities. 
 As of September 30, 2024, of our CMBS or RMBS were variable rate.

 Our securitizations have each been structured as bankruptcy-remote entities whose assets are not intended to be available to the creditors of any other party. 
 Commercial and Residential Loan Sales 
 Within the Commercial and Residential Lending Segment, we originate or acquire commercial mortgage loans, subsequently selling all or a portion thereof. Typically, our motivation for entering into these transactions is to effectively create leverage on the subordinated position that we will retain and hold for investment. We also may sell certain of our previously-acquired residential loans to third parties outside a securitization. 
 
 There were sales of commercial or residential loans within the Commercial and Residential Lending Segment during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 The above table excludes certain interest rate derivatives which serve as an economic hedge related to our residential loan portfolio. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we entered into a series of derivative transactions related to this loan portfolio in an effort to extend hedge duration. The current high interest rate environment has caused these loans to experience lower prepayment speeds than was originally anticipated at the time of their origination. In order to minimize volatility in future earnings and cash flows while minimizing the current cash outflow, we: (i) entered into a series of reverse swap trades to offset approximately of the dollar duration of our existing interest rate swaps through the end of 2024 and approximately between 2025 through their termination in the second quarter of 2027; and (ii) entered into a forward starting swap from June 2027 for which pays fixed and receives floating in order to replace the swaps reversed. Given the volume of these hedges and their sequential nature, the notional value of these new swaps is not representative of the notional value of our portfolio, and they were thus excluded from the table above. The notional value of the swaps described in (i) above that were effective as of September 30, 2024 totaled billion.

 Assets held by the CLOs and SASB are restricted and can be used only to settle obligations of the CLOs and SASB, including the subordinate interests owned by us. The liabilities of the CLOs and SASB are non-recourse to us and can only be satisfied from the assets of the CLOs and SASB. 
 We also hold controlling interests in other non-securitization entities that are considered VIEs. The Woodstar Fund, Woodstar Feeder Fund, L.P. and one of the Woodstar Fund s indirect investees, SPT Dolphin Intermediate LLC SPT Dolphin ), the entity which holds the Woodstar II Portfolio, are each VIEs because the third party interest holders do not carry kick-out rights or substantive participating rights. We were deemed to be the primary beneficiary of those VIEs because we possess both the power to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact their economic performance and a significant economic interest in each entity. The Woodstar Fund had total assets of billion, including its indirect

 We also hold a controlling interest in a joint venture (the CMBS JV within our Investing and Servicing Segment, which is considered a VIE because the third party interest holder does not carry kick-out rights or substantive participating rights. We are deemed the primary beneficiary of the CMBS JV. This VIE had total assets of million and liabilities of million as of September 30, 2024. Refer to Note 17 for further discussion. 
 In addition to the above non-securitization entities, we have smaller VIEs with total assets of million and liabilities of million as of September 30, 2024. 
 VIEs in which we are not the Primary Beneficiary 
 In certain instances, we hold a variable interest in a VIE in the form of CMBS, but either (i) we are not appointed, or do not serve as, special servicer or servicing administrator or (ii) an unrelated third party has the rights to unilaterally remove us as special servicer without cause. In these instances, we do not have the power to direct activities that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance. In other cases, the variable interest we hold does not obligate us to absorb losses or provide us with the right to receive benefits from the VIE which could potentially be significant. For these structures, we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE, and we do not consolidate these VIEs. 
 As noted above, we are not obligated to provide, nor have we provided, any financial support for any of our securitization VIEs, whether or not we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. As such, the risk associated with our involvement in these VIEs is limited to the carrying value of our investment in the entity. As of September 30, 2024, our maximum risk of loss related to securitization VIEs in which we were not the primary beneficiary was million on a fair value basis. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the securitization VIEs which we do not consolidate had debt obligations to beneficial interest holders with unpaid principal balances, excluding the notional value of interest-only securities, of billion. The corresponding assets are comprised primarily of commercial mortgage loans with unpaid principal balances corresponding to the amounts of the outstanding debt obligations. 
 We also hold passive non-controlling interests in certain unconsolidated entities that are considered VIEs. We are not the primary beneficiaries of these VIEs as we do not possess the power to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact their economic performance and therefore report our interests, which totaled million as of September 30, 2024, within investments in unconsolidated entities on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. Our maximum risk of loss is limited to our carrying value of the investments.

 Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Subsidiaries 
 As discussed in Note 2, on November 5, 2021 we sold a non-controlling interest in the Woodstar Fund to third party investors for net cash proceeds of million. Under the Woodstar Fund operating agreement, such interests are contingently redeemable by us, at the option of the interest holder, for cash at liquidation fair value if any assets remain upon termination of the Woodstar Fund. The Woodstar Fund operating agreement specifies an term with extension options, the first at our option and the second subject to consent of an advisory committee representing the non-controlling interest holders. Accordingly, these contingently redeemable non-controlling interests have been classified as Temporary Equity in our condensed consolidated balance sheets and represent the fair value of the Woodstar Fund s net assets allocable to those interests. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, net (loss) income attributable

The Class A Units are redeemable for consideration equal to the current share price of the Company s common stock on a -for-one basis, with the consideration paid in either cash or the Company s common stock, at the determination of the Company.

 To the extent SPT Dolphin has sufficient cash available, the Class A Units earn a preferred return indexed to the dividend rate of the Company s common stock.

 For secured financing, we discounted the contractual cash flows at the interest rate at which such arrangements would bear if executed in the current market. The fair value of investment level working capital is assumed to approximate carrying value due to its primarily short-term monetary nature. The fair value of interest rate derivatives is determined using the methodology described in the Derivatives discussion below. 
 
 Internal valuations at interim quarter ends, including September 30, 2024, are prepared by management.

 In connection with the prior sale of a million first mortgage loan on an office and retail center in Los Angeles, for which we retained the mezzanine loan million amortized cost), we entered into various guarantees, including a funding guaranty, a carry guaranty and a guaranty related to tenant improvement and leasing commission deficiencies. As of June 30, 2024, these guarantees provided for the payment of approximately million by us to the senior lender in the event that the first mortgage loan is foreclosed. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, this amount increased by million because of payments made by the borrower pursuant to these guarantees. In conjunction with an extension of the loan for up to , we are finalizing a modification with the borrower and senior lender to effectively monetize these guarantees as future funding commitments over the extension period. Any payments pursuant to these guarantees would be recovered via ultimate liquidation of the property and would precede any recovery by the borrower. The senior lender obtained an appraisal during the three months ended March 31, 2024 indicating full recovery in excess of the outstanding debt plus the guarantees. Given the probability that all payments pursuant to these guarantees will be made, we included million of potential future payments in our general CECL allowance determination. As of September 30, 2024, this loan, including the guarantees, had an associated general CECL allowance of million. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our Infrastructure Lending Segment had future infrastructure loan funding commitments totaling million, including million under revolvers and letters of credit LCs and million under delayed draw term loans. As of September 30, 2024, million of revolvers and LCs were outstanding. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, our Infrastructure Lending Segment had outstanding loan purchase commitments of million. 
 Generally, funding commitments are subject to certain conditions that must be met, such as customary construction draw certifications, minimum debt service coverage ratios or executions of new leases before advances are made to the borrower. 
 Management is not aware of any other contractual obligations, legal proceedings, or any other contingent obligations incurred in the normal course of business that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Our residential loans are secured by a first mortgage lien on residential property and primarily consist of non-agency residential loans that are not guaranteed by any U.S. Government agency or federally chartered corporation. 
 
 Infrastructure lending (the Infrastructure Lending Segment engages primarily in originating, acquiring, financing and managing infrastructure debt investments. 
 
 Real estate property (the Property Segment engages primarily in acquiring and managing equity interests in stabilized and to be stabilized commercial real estate properties, including multifamily properties, that are held for investment. 
 
 Real estate investing and servicing (the Investing and Servicing Segment includes (i) a servicing business in the U.S. that manages and works out problem assets, (ii) an investment business that selectively acquires and manages unrated, investment grade and non-investment grade rated CMBS, including subordinated interests of securitization and resecuritization transactions, (iii) a mortgage loan business which originates conduit loans for the primary purpose of selling these loans into securitization transactions and (iv) an investment business that selectively acquires commercial real estate assets, including properties acquired from CMBS trusts. 
 
 Our segments exclude the consolidation of securitization variable interest entities VIEs ). 
 Refer to Note 1 of our condensed consolidated financial statements included herein (the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our business and organization. 
 Economic Environment 
 
 During 2023, inflation began to moderate as a result of the monetary policy tightening actions taken by the Federal Reserve, including repeatedly raising interest rates. While the Federal Reserve began to lower interest rates in September 2024, interest rates may remain near recent highs which creates uncertainty for the economy and for our borrowers. Elevated interest rates over time may adversely affect our existing borrowers and lead to nonperformance as higher costs may dampen consumer spending and slow income growth, which may negatively impact the collateral underlying certain of our loans. Additionally, elevated interest rates could adversely affect the value of commercial real estate we own and that collateralizes our loans. It remains difficult to predict the full impact of recent events and any future changes in interest rates or inflation.

In addition, following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. office sector has been adversely affected by the increase in remote working arrangements and, over the past several years, the retail sector has been adversely affected by electronic commerce. These negative factors have been considered in the determination of our current expected credit loss CECL allowance as discussed in Note 4 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. We may be required to record further increases to our CECL reserves in the future, depending on the performance of our portfolio and broader market conditions, and there may be volatility in the level of our CECL reserves, particularly if market conditions relevant to the office sector do not improve. Any such reserve increases are difficult to predict.

Results of Operations 
 The discussion below is based on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP and therefore reflects the elimination of certain key financial statement line items related to the consolidation of securitization variable interest entities VIEs ), particularly within revenues and other income, as discussed in Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. For a discussion of our results of operations excluding the impact of Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 810 as it relates to the consolidation of securitization VIEs, refer to the section captioned Non-GAAP Financial Measures.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended June 30, 2024 
 Commercial and Residential Lending Segment 
 
 Revenues 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenues of our Commercial and Residential Lending Segment decreased 8.1 million to 385.5 million, compared to 393.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. This was primarily due to a decrease in interest income from loans of 9.2 million comprised of (i) an 8.4 million decrease from commercial loans, reflecting lower average balances and additional loans placed on nonaccrual, partially offset by higher prepayment related income, and (ii) a 0.8 million decrease from residential loans reflecting lower average balances. 
 
 Costs and Expenses 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, costs and expenses of our Commercial and Residential Lending Segment increased 11.5 million to 294.5 million, compared to 283.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. This increase was primarily due to a 22.0 million increase in the credit loss provision, partially offset by decreases of 7.0 million in interest expense associated with the various secured financing facilities used to fund a portion of this segment s investment portfolio and 3.3 million in general and administrative expenses. The increase in the credit loss provision was primarily due to higher LTVs on certain assets resulting from recent appraisals, as well as the impact of including future funding now considered probable under a loan guarantee arrangement (see Note 22 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to lower average borrowings outstanding due to paydowns from net loan repayments and excess cash balances. 
 
 Net Interest Income (amounts in thousands) 
 For the Three Months Ended 
 September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 Change Interest income from loans 349,589 358,749 (9,160) Interest income from investment securities 29,392 29,373 19 Interest expense (209,464) (216,511) 7,047 Net interest income 169,517 171,611 (2,094) 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income of our Commercial and Residential Lending Segment decreased 2.1 million to 169.5 million, compared to 171.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. This decrease reflects the decrease in interest income, partially offset by the decrease in interest expense on our secured financing facilities, both as discussed in the sections above. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the weighted average unlevered yields on the Commercial and Residential Lending Segment s loans and investment securities, excluding retained RMBS and loans for which interest income is not recognized, were as follows: 
 For the Three Months Ended 
 September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 Commercial 9.4 9.4 Residential 5.0 5.1 Overall 8.7 8.8 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the weighted average unlevered yields on our commercial and residential loans were relatively unchanged from the previous quarter. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the Commercial and Residential Lending Segment s weighted average secured borrowing rates, inclusive of the amortization of deferred financing fees, were 7.5 and 7.6 , respectively. Interest rate hedges had the effect of reducing these weighted average borrowing costs to 6.6 and 6.7 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively.

Other Income 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, other income of our Commercial and Residential Lending Segment decreased 14.5 million to 48.1 million compared to 62.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. This decrease was primarily due to (i) a 117.6 million unfavorable change in gain (loss) on derivatives, partially offset by (ii) a 52.1 million increase in foreign currency gain, (iii) a 48.0 million favorable change in fair value of residential loans and (iv) a 3.2 million favorable change in fair value of primarily RMBS investment securities. The unfavorable change in gain (loss) on derivatives in the third quarter of 2024 reflects a 62.2 million unfavorable change in gain (loss) on interest rate swaps principally related to residential loans, which is partially offset by the favorable change in fair value of those loans, and a 55.4 million increased loss on foreign currency hedges. The interest rate swaps are used primarily to hedge our interest rate risk on residential loans held-for-sale and to fix our interest rate payments on certain variable rate borrowings which fund fixed rate investments. The foreign currency hedges are used to fix the U.S. dollar amounts of cash flows (both interest and principal payments) we expect to receive from our foreign currency denominated loans and investments. The increased foreign currency gain and the increased loss on foreign currency hedges reflect the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the pound sterling GBP ), Euro EUR and Australian dollar AUD in the third quarter of 2024, compared to a lesser weakening of the U.S. dollar against the GBP and AUD, partially offset by a strengthening against the EUR, in the second quarter of 2024. 
 
 Infrastructure Lending Segment 
 
 Revenues 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenues of our Infrastructure Lending Segment increased 0.2 million to 65.4 million, compared to 65.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. This was primarily due to a 0.5 million increase in interest income on cash balances, partially offset by a decrease in interest income from loans of 0.3 million reflecting lower average loan balances, the effect of which was partially offset by higher prepayment related income. 
 
 Costs and Expense s 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, costs and expenses of our Infrastructure Lending Segment increased 2.6 million to 44.4 million, compared to 41.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to increases of 1.7 million in credit loss provision and 0.5 million in interest expense associated with the various secured financing facilities used to fund this segment s investment portfolio.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income of our Infrastructure Lending Segment decreased 0.8 million to 25.7 million, compared to 26.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The decrease reflects the decrease in interest income from loans and increase in interest expense on the secured financing facilities, both as discussed in the sections above. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the weighted average unlevered yield on the Infrastructure Lending Segment s loans and investment securities, excluding those for which interest income is not recognized, was 10.4 and 10.3 , respectively. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the Infrastructure Lending Segment s weighted average secured borrowing rate, inclusive of the amortization of deferred financing fees, was 8.0 in each period. 
 
 Other Loss 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, other loss of our Infrastructure Lending Segment increased 0.4 million to 0.5 million, compared to 0.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, primarily due to an increased loss from unconsolidated entities.

 Revenues 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenues of our Property Segment increased 0.6 million to 16.6 million, compared to 16.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. 
 
 Costs and Expenses 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, costs and expenses of our Property Segment decreased 0.8 million to 23.6 million, compared to 24.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The decrease reflects a 1.2 million decrease in interest expense on variable rate borrowings secured by our Medical Office Portfolio, partially offset by a 0.5 million increase in costs of rental operations. 
 
 Other (Loss) Income 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, other income of our Property Segment decreased 12.5 million to a loss of 7.1 million compared to income of 5.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The decrease is primarily due to (i) a 12.0 million unfavorable change in income (loss) attributable to investments of the Woodstar Fund, primarily related to unrealized changes in fair value, and (ii) a 0.8 million unfavorable change in gain (loss) on derivatives which primarily hedge the interest rate risk on borrowings secured by our Medical Office Portfolio. 
 
 Investing and Servicing Segment 
 
 Revenues 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenues of our Investing and Servicing Segment decreased 3.3 million to 52.3 million, compared to 55.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The decrease in revenues is primarily due to a 4.6 million decrease in servicing fees, partially offset by a 1.0 million increase in interest income from conduit loans and CMBS investments. The decrease in servicing fees is primarily due to lower loan modification and assumption fees. The increase in interest income is primarily due to higher average conduit loan balances due to increased origination and securitization activity. 
 
 Costs and Expenses 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, costs and expenses of our Investing and Servicing Segment increased 2.1 million to 39.4 million, compared to 37.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The increase reflects increases in interest expense of 1.7 million, primarily related to the financing of conduit loans and CMBS investments, and general and administrative expenses of 0.6 million, primarily related to the increased loan origination and securitization activity. 
 
 Other Loss 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, other loss of our Investing and Servicing Segment decreased 0.5 million to 4.3 million, compared to 4.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024.

Corporate and Other Items 
 
 Corporate Costs and Expenses 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, corporate expenses decreased 4.0 million to 100.9 million, compared to 104.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. This decrease is primarily due to a 3.1 million decrease in management fees, primarily reflecting lower incentive fees. 
 
 Corporate Other Income (Loss) 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, corporate other income (loss) improved 37.9 million to income of 28.7 million, compared to a loss of 9.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. This was due to a favorable change in gain (loss) on our fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps which hedge a portion of our unsecured senior notes. 
 
 Securitization VIE Eliminations 
 
 Securitization VIE eliminations primarily reclassify interest income and servicing fee revenues to other income (loss) for the CMBS and RMBS VIEs that we consolidate as primary beneficiary. Such eliminations have no overall effect on net income (loss) attributable to Starwood Property Trust. The reclassified revenues, along with applicable changes in fair value of investment securities and servicing rights, comprise the other income (loss) caption Change in net assets related to consolidated VIEs, which represents our beneficial interest in those consolidated VIEs. The magnitude of the securitization VIE eliminations is merely a function of the number of CMBS and RMBS trusts consolidated in any given period, and as such, is not a meaningful indicator of operating results. The eliminations primarily relate to CMBS trusts for which the Investing and Servicing Segment is deemed the primary beneficiary and, to a much lesser extent, some CMBS and RMBS trusts for which the Commercial and Residential Lending Segment is deemed the primary beneficiary. 
 
 Income Tax Provision 
 
 Our consolidated income taxes principally relate to the taxable nature of our loan servicing and loan securitization businesses which are housed in taxable REIT subsidiaries TRSs ). For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our income tax provision decreased 5.5 million to 10.4 million compared to 15.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 due to lower taxable income of our TRSs in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024. 
 
 Net Loss Attributable to Non-controlling Interests 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, net loss attributable to non-controlling interests increased 3.7 million to 3.9 million, compared to 0.2 million during the three months ended June 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to non-controlling interests in unfavorable changes in unrealized gains (losses) of the Woodstar Fund investments and a consolidated CMBS joint venture in the third quarter of 2024.

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenues of our Commercial and Residential Lending Segment decreased 68.5 million to 1.2 billion, compared to 1.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to decreases in interest income from loans of 63.9 million and investment securities of 12.3 million, partially offset by a 5.4 million increase in rental income from foreclosed properties. The decrease in interest income from loans reflects (i) a 56.2 million decrease from commercial loans, reflecting lower average balances and additional loans placed on nonaccrual, partially offset by the effects of higher average index rates and prepayment related income, and (ii) a 7.7 million decrease from residential loans principally due to lower average balances. The decrease in interest income from investment securities was primarily due to lower average commercial investment balances due to repayments. 
 Costs and Expenses 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, costs and expenses of our Commercial and Residential Lending Segment decreased 112.1 million to 870.4 million, compared to 982.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to decreases of (i) 62.3 million in interest expense associated with the various secured financing facilities used to fund a portion of this segment s investment portfolio and (ii) 57.4 million in credit loss provision, partially offset by (iii) a 6.9 million increase in general and administrative expenses, primarily for compensation and professional fees. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to lower average borrowings outstanding due to paydowns from net loan repayments and excess cash balances, partially offset by the effect of higher average index rates. The decrease in credit loss provision was primarily due to (i) a lesser deterioration in modeled macroeconomic forecasts in the nine months of 2024 compared to the nine months of 2023 and (ii) the nonrecurrence of a 14.7 million realized credit loss on a commercial loan in the 2023 period, the effects of which were partially offset by (iii) selecting the most unfavorable modeled macroeconomic forecast for office and retail loans in the 2024 period and (iv) including future funding now considered probable in the 2024 period under a loan guarantee arrangement (see Note 22 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements).

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income of our Commercial and Residential Lending Segment decreased 13.9 million to 530.9 million, compared to 544.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease reflects the decrease in interest income, partially offset by the decrease in interest expense on our secured financing facilities, both as discussed in the sections above. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the weighted average unlevered yields on the Commercial and Residential Lending Segment s loans and investment securities, excluding retained RMBS and loans for which interest income is not recognized, were as follows: For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Commercial 9.7 9.2 Residential 5.0 5.0 Overall 9.0 8.6 
 The weighted average unlevered yield on our commercial loans increased primarily due to higher average index rates and prepayment related income. The unlevered yield on our residential loans was relatively unchanged.

Table of Contents 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Commercial and Residential Lending Segment s weighted average secured borrowing rates, inclusive of the amortization of deferred financing fees, were 7.6 and 7.1 , respectively. The increase in borrowing rates primarily reflects higher average index rates. Interest rate hedges had the effect of adjusting these weighted average borrowing costs to 6.7 and 6.5 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Other Income 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other income of our Commercial and Residential Lending Segment increased 115.2 million to 137.1 million, compared to 21.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase primarily reflects (i) a 228.2 million favorable change in fair value of residential loans, (ii) a 42.1 million favorable change in foreign currency gain (loss), (iii) the non-recurrence of a 23.8 million impairment loss on a foreclosed vacant building in the 2023 period and (iv) a 6.7 million increase in earnings from unconsolidated entities primarily due to an observable price change in an equity investment, partially offset by (v) a 121.0 million unfavorable change in gain (loss) on derivatives, and (vi) a 67.1 million unfavorable change in fair value of primarily RMBS investment securities. The unfavorable change in gain (loss) on derivatives during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflects (i) a 93.8 million decreased gain on interest rate swaps principally related to residential loans and (ii) a 27.2 million unfavorable change in gain (loss) on foreign currency hedges. The interest rate swaps are used primarily to hedge our interest rate risk on residential loans held-for-sale and to fix our interest rate payments on certain variable rate borrowings which fund fixed rate investments. The foreign currency hedges are used to fix the U.S. dollar amounts of cash flows (both interest and principal payments) we expect to receive from our foreign currency denominated loans and investments. The favorable change in foreign currency gain (loss) and the unfavorable change in gain (loss) on foreign currency hedges reflect the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the GBP, EUR and AUD during the nine months of 2024, compared to a strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the EUR and AUD, partially offset by a weakening against the GBP, in the nine months of 2023. 
 Infrastructure Lending Segment 
 Revenues 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenues of our Infrastructure Lending Segment increased 22.0 million to 197.6 million, compared to 175.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to increases in interest income of (i) 21.6 million from loans, principally due to higher average loan balances, interest rates and prepayment related income, and (ii) 1.6 million from cash balances, partially offset by (iii) a 1.3 million decrease in interest income from investment securities, primarily due to lower average balances resulting from repayments. 
 Costs and Expense s 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 costs and expenses of our Infrastructure Lending Segment were relatively unchanged at 132.1 million. A 15.3 million decrease in credit loss provision was substantially offset by (i) a 12.0 million increase in interest expense associated with the various secured financing facilities used to fund this segment s investment portfolio and (ii) a 3.1 million increase in general and administrative expenses, primarily for compensation and professional fees. The decrease in the credit loss provision was primarily due to the nonrecurrence of specific allowances for a credit-deteriorated loan and investment security provided during the 2023 period. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher average interest rates and borrowings outstanding.

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income of our Infrastructure Lending Segment increased 8.3 million to 79.7 million, compared to 71.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase reflects the net increase in interest income, partially offset by the increase in interest expense on the secured financing facilities, both as discussed in the sections above.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the weighted average unlevered yields on the Infrastructure Lending Segment s loans and investment securities, excluding those for which interest income is not recognized, were 10.6 and 10.0 , respectively, primarily reflecting higher average interest rates in the 2024 period. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Infrastructure Lending Segment s weighted average secured borrowing rates, inclusive of the amortization of deferred financing fees, were 8.0 and 7.5 , respectively. 
 Other (Loss) Income 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, other income of our Infrastructure Lending Segment decreased 2.0 million to a loss of 0.7 million, compared to income of 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease primarily reflects a 2.0 million decrease in earnings from unconsolidated entities.

 Revenues 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenues of our Property Segment decreased 17.7 million to 53.4 million, compared to 71.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the sale of our Master Lease Portfolio on February 29, 2024. 
 Costs and Expenses 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, costs and expenses of our Property Segment decreased 10.2 million to 74.1 million, compared to 84.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to the sale of our Master Lease Portfolio on February 29, 2024. 
 Other Income 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other income of our Property Segment decreased 157.9 million to 100.3 million, compared to 258.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to (i) a 243.4 million decrease in income attributable to investments of the Woodstar Fund due to lower unrealized increases in fair value and (ii) a 3.0 million decreased gain on derivatives which primarily hedge our interest rate risk on borrowings secured by our Medical Office Portfolio, partially offset by (iii) a 90.8 million net gain on sale of the Master Lease Portfolio in the first quarter of 2024. 
 Investing and Servicing Segment 
 Revenues 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenues of our Investing and Servicing Segment increased 23.7 million to 150.0 million, compared to 126.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in revenues is primarily due to (i) an 18.0 million increase in servicing fees principally related to loan modifications and (ii) a 9.2 million increase in interest income primarily due to higher average conduit loan balances due to increased origination and securitization activity, partially offset by (iii) a 5.1 million decrease in rental income due to fewer operating properties held.

Costs and Expenses 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, costs and expenses of our Investing and Servicing Segment increased 8.1 million to 112.8 million, compared to 104.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in costs and expenses primarily reflects (i) a 9.4 million increase in general and administrative expenses, principally reflecting increased incentive compensation due to higher loan securitization volume and (ii) a 2.2 million increase in interest expense primarily on higher conduit loan balances, partially offset by (iii) a 4.0 million decrease in depreciation and other costs of rental operations due to fewer operating properties held. 
 Other Loss 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other loss of our Investing and Servicing Segment increased 7.3 million to 14.0 million, compared to 6.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in other loss was primarily due to (i) a 23.2 million greater decrease in fair value of CMBS investments, (ii) a 7.3 million decrease in earnings from unconsolidated entities, (iii) a 7.3 million decreased gain on sale of operating properties and (iv) a 4.3 million decreased gain on derivatives which primarily hedge our interest rate risk on conduit loans and CMBS investments, partially offset by (v) a 33.4 million greater increase in fair value of conduit loans. 
 Corporate and Other Items 
 Corporate Costs and Expenses 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, corporate expenses increased 29.1 million to 314.4 million, compared to 285.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to (i) a 24.2 million increase in interest expense reflecting higher average unsecured borrowings outstanding and higher index rates on our secured term loans and (ii) a 6.4 million increase in management fees, primarily reflecting higher incentive fees. 
 Corporate Other Income (Loss) 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, corporate other income (loss) improved 29.1 million to income of 5.7 million, compared to a loss of 23.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This was due to a favorable change in gain (loss) on fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps which hedge a portion of our unsecured senior notes. 
 Securitization VIE Eliminations 
 
 Refer to the preceding comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2024 to the three months ended June 30, 2024 for a discussion of the effect of securitization VIE eliminations. 
 Income Tax (Provision) Benefit 
 Our consolidated income taxes principally relate to the taxable nature of our loan servicing and loan securitization businesses which are housed in TRSs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our income taxes increased 46.5 million to a provision of 27.5 million, compared to a benefit of 19.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to taxable income of our TRSs in the 2024 period compared to tax losses in the 2023 period primarily attributable to unrealized fair value changes in our residential loans and related interest rate derivatives. 
 Net Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net income attributable to non-controlling interests decreased 63.8 million to 1.5 million, compared to 65.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to non-controlling interests in (i) lower income of the Woodstar Fund, reflecting lower unrealized increases in fair value, and (ii) losses of a consolidated CMBS joint venture in the 2024 period compared to income in the 2023 period.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Distributable Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure. We calculate Distributable Earnings as GAAP net income (loss) excluding the following: (i) non-cash equity compensation expense; (ii) the incentive fee due under our management agreement; (iii) acquisition and investment pursuit costs associated with successful acquisitions; (iv) depreciation and amortization of real estate and associated intangibles; (v) unrealized gains (losses), net of realized gains (losses), as described further below; (vi) other non-cash items; and (vii) to the extent deducted from net income (loss), distributions payable with respect to equity securities of subsidiaries issued in exchange for properties or interests therein (i.e. the Woodstar II Class A units), with each of the above adjusted for any related non-controlling interest. Distributable Earnings may be adjusted to exclude one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain other non-cash adjustments as determined by our Manager and approved by a majority of our independent directors. 
 As noted in (v) above, we exclude unrealized gains and losses from our calculation of Distributable Earnings and include realized gains and losses. The nature of these adjustments is described more fully in the footnotes to our reconciliation tables. In order to present each of these items within our Distributable Earnings reconciliation tables in a manner which can be agreed more easily to our GAAP financial statements, we reverse the entirety of those items within our GAAP financial statements which contain unrealized and realized components (i.e. those assets and liabilities carried at fair value, including loans or securities for which the fair value option has been elected, investment company assets and liabilities, derivatives, foreign currency conversions, and accumulated depreciation related to sold properties). The realized portion of these items is then separately included in the reconciliation table, along with a description as to how the amount was determined. 
 
 The CECL reserve and any property impairment losses have been excluded from Distributable Earnings consistent with other unrealized losses pursuant to our existing policy for reporting Distributable Earnings. We expect to only recognize such potential credit or property impairment losses in Distributable Earnings if and when such amounts are deemed nonrecoverable upon a realization event. This is generally at the time a loan is repaid, or in the case of a foreclosure or other property, when the underlying asset is sold. Non-recoverability may also be determined if, in our determination, it is nearly certain the carrying amounts will not be collected or realized upon sale. The realized loss amount reflected in Distributable Earnings will equal the difference between the cash received, or expected to be received, and the Distributable Earnings basis of the asset, and is reflective of our economic experience as it relates to the ultimate realization of the asset. The timing of any such loss realization in our Distributable Earnings may differ materially from the timing of the corresponding CECL reserves, charge-offs or impairments in our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 We believe that Distributable Earnings provides meaningful information to consider in addition to our net income (loss) and cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. We believe Distributable Earnings is a useful financial metric for existing and potential future holders of our common stock as historically, over time, Distributable Earnings has been a strong indicator of our dividends per share. As a REIT, we generally must distribute annually at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, subject to certain adjustments, and therefore we believe our dividends are one of the principal reasons stockholders may invest in our common stock. Further, Distributable Earnings helps us to evaluate our performance excluding the effects of certain transactions and GAAP adjustments that we believe are not necessarily indicative of our current loan portfolio and operations, and is a performance metric we consider when declaring our dividends. We also use Distributable Earnings (previously defined as Core Earnings to compute the incentive fee due under our management agreement. 
 Distributable Earnings does not represent net income (loss) or cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income (loss), or an indication of our GAAP cash flows from operations, a measure of our liquidity, taxable income, or an indication of funds available for our cash needs. In addition, our methodology for calculating Distributable Earnings may differ from the methodologies employed by other companies to calculate the same or similar supplemental performance measures, and accordingly, our reported Distributable Earnings may not be comparable to the Distributable Earnings reported by other companies. 
 As discussed in Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, consolidation of securitization variable interest entities VIEs results in the elimination of certain key financial statement line items, particularly within revenues and other income, including unrealized changes in fair value of loans and investment securities. These line items are essential to understanding the true financial performance of our business segments and the Company as a whole. For this reason, as referenced in Note 2 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we present business segment data in Note 23 without consolidation of these VIEs. This is how we manage our business and is the basis for all data reviewed with our board of directors, investors and analysts. This presentation also allows for a more transparent reconciliation of the unrealized gain (loss) adjustments below to the segment data presented in Note 23.

The weighted average diluted share count applied to Distributable Earnings for purposes of determining Distributable Earnings per share EPS is computed using the GAAP diluted share count, adjusted for the following: 
 (i) Unvested stock awards Currently, unvested stock awards are excluded from the denominator of GAAP EPS. The related compensation expense is also excluded from Distributable Earnings. In order to effectuate dilution from these awards in the Distributable Earnings computation, we adjust the GAAP diluted share count to include these shares. 
 (ii) Convertible Notes Conversion of our Convertible Notes is an event that is contingent upon numerous factors, none of which are in our control, and is an event that may or may not occur. Consistent with the treatment of other unrealized adjustments to Distributable Earnings, we adjust the GAAP diluted share count to exclude the potential shares issuable upon conversion until a conversion occurs. 
 (iii) Subsidiary equity The intent of a February 2018 amendment to our management agreement (the Amendment is to treat subsidiary equity in the same manner as if parent equity had been issued. The Class A Units issued in connection with the acquisition of assets in our Woodstar II Portfolio are currently excluded from our GAAP diluted share count, with the subsidiary equity represented as non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries on our GAAP balance sheet. Consistent with the Amendment, we adjust GAAP diluted share count to include these subsidiary units.

 As noted above, the definition of Distributable Earnings allows management to make adjustments, subject to the approval of a majority of our independent directors. This is done in situations where such adjustments are considered appropriate in order for Distributable Earnings to be calculated in a manner consistent with its definition and objective. No adjustments to the definition of Distributable Earnings became effective during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The following table summarizes our quarterly Distributable Earnings per weighted average diluted share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended June 30, 2024 
 
 Commercial and Residential Lending Segment 
 
 The Commercial and Residential Lending Segment s Distributable Earnings increased by 1.0 million, from 188.9 million during the second quarter of 2024 to 189.9 million in the third quarter of 2024. After making adjustments for the calculation of Distributable Earnings, revenues were 390.6 million, costs and expenses were 224.7 million, other income was 24.0 million and there was no income tax provision or benefit. 
 
 Revenues, consisting principally of interest income on loans, decreased by 8.5 million in the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to decreases in interest income from loans of 9.2 million comprised of (i) an 8.4 million decrease from commercial loans, reflecting lower average balances and additional loans placed on nonaccrual, partially offset by higher prepayment related income, and (ii) a 0.8 million decrease from residential loans reflecting lower average balances. 
 
 Costs and expenses decreased by 10.6 million in the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to (i) a 7.0 million decrease in interest expense associated with the various secured financing facilities used to fund a portion of this segment s investment portfolio, primarily reflecting lower average borrowings outstanding due to paydowns from net loan repayments and excess cash balances, and (ii) a 3.3 million decrease in general and administrative expenses. 
 
 Other income decreased by 1.1 million in the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Infrastructure Lending Segment 
 
 The Infrastructure Lending Segment s Distributable Earnings decreased by 0.8 million, from 23.6 million during the second quarter of 2024 to 22.8 million in the third quarter of 2024. After making adjustments for the calculation of Distributable Earnings, revenues were 65.4 million, costs and expenses were 42.5 million and other loss was 0.1 million. 
 
 Revenues, consisting principally of interest income on loans, increased by 0.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to a 0.5 million increase in interest income on cash balances, partially offset by a decrease in interest income from loans of 0.3 million reflecting lower average loan balances, the effect of which was partially offset by higher prepayment related income. 
 
 Costs and expenses increased by 0.9 million in the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to a 0.5 million increase in interest expense and a 0.2 million increase in general and administrative expenses. 
 
 Other income decreased by 0.1 million from nominal income to a small loss in the third quarter of 2024.

Other income decreased by 1.3 million in the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to a 3.1 million decrease in realized gains on derivatives which primarily hedge our interest rate risk on borrowings secured by our Medical Office Portfolio, partially offset by a 1.5 million increase in distributable income from the Woodstar Fund. 
 
 Income attributable to non-controlling interests in the Woodstar Fund increased by 0.3 million in the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Investing and Servicing Segment 
 
 The Investing and Servicing Segment s Distributable Earnings increased by 1.0 million, from 37.1 million during the second quarter of 2024 to 38.1 million in the third quarter of 2024. After making adjustments for the calculation of Distributable Earnings, revenues were 60.7 million, costs and expenses were 36.5 million, other income was 20.8 million, there was no income tax provision or benefit, and the deduction of income attributable to non-controlling interests was 6.9 million. 
 
 Revenues decreased by 2.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to a 4.6 million decrease in servicing fees, partially offset by a 2.1 million increase in interest income from conduit loans and CMBS investments. The treatment of CMBS interest income on a GAAP basis is complicated by our application of the ASC 810 consolidation rules. In an attempt to treat these securities similar to the trust s other investment securities, we compute distributable interest income pursuant to an effective yield methodology. In doing so, we segregate the portfolio into various categories based on the components of the bonds cash flows and the volatility related to each of these components. We then accrete interest income on an effective yield basis using the components of cash flows that are reliably estimable. Other minor adjustments are made to reflect management s expectations for other components of the projected cash flow stream. 
 
 Costs and expenses increased by 2.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to increases in interest expense of 1.7 million, primarily related to the financing of conduit loans and CMBS investments, and general and administrative expenses of 0.6 million, primarily related to the increased loan origination and securitization activity. 
 
 Other income includes profit realized upon securitization of loans by our conduit business, gains on sales of CMBS and operating properties, gains and losses on derivatives that were either effectively terminated or novated, and earnings from unconsolidated entities. These items are typically offset by a decrease in the fair value of our domestic servicing rights intangible which reflects the expected amortization of this deteriorating asset, net of increases in fair value due to the attainment of new servicing contracts. Derivatives include instruments which hedge interest rate risk and credit risk on our conduit loans and CMBS investments. For GAAP purposes, the loans, CMBS and derivatives are accounted for at fair value, with all changes in fair value (realized or unrealized) recognized in earnings. The adjustments to Distributable Earnings outlined above are also applied to the GAAP earnings of our unconsolidated entities. Other income increased by 8.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to a 4.1 million increase in realized gains on conduit loans, a 3.8 million decrease in recognized credit losses on CMBS, a 3.2 million gain on sale of an operating property and a 2.9 million increase in realized gains from CMBS sales, partially offset by a 5.4 million unfavorable change in realized gain (loss) on derivatives which primarily hedge our interest rate risk on conduit loans and CMBS investments. 
 
 Income attributable to non-controlling interests increased 3.3 million in the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to non-controlling interests in the gain on sale of an operating property. 
 
 Corporate 
 
 Corporate loss decreased by 0.2 million, from 105.9 million during the second quarter of 2024 to 105.7 million in the third quarter of 2024.

 (1) The reconciling items in this section are exactly equivalent to the amounts recognized within GAAP net income (before the consolidation of VIEs), each of which can be agreed back to the respective lines within Note 23 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. They reflect both unrealized and realized (gains) and losses. For added transparency and consistency of presentation, the entire amount recognized in GAAP income is reversed in this section, and the realized components of these amounts are reflected in the next section entitled Recognition of Distributable realized gains / (losses).

(2) Represents the realized portion of GAAP gains (losses) on residential and commercial conduit loans carried under the fair value option that were sold during the period or expected to be sold in the near term subject to a binding agreement. The amount is calculated as the difference between (i) the net proceeds received or expected to be received in connection with a securitization or sale of loans and (ii) such loans historical cost basis. 
 (3) Represents loan losses that are deemed nonrecoverable, which is generally upon a realization event, such as when a loan is repaid, or in the case of foreclosure, when the underlying asset is sold. Non-recoverability may also be determined if, in our determination, it is nearly certain that the carrying amounts will not be collected or realized upon sale. The loss amount is calculated as the difference between the cash received or expected to be received and the Distributable Earnings basis of the asset. 
 (4) Represents the realized portion of GAAP gains (losses) on CMBS and RMBS carried under the fair value option that are sold or impaired during the period. Upon sale, the difference between the cash proceeds received and the historical cost basis of the security is treated as a realized gain or loss for Distributable Earnings purposes. We consider a CMBS or an RMBS credit loss to be realized when such amounts are deemed nonrecoverable. Non-recoverability is generally at the time the underlying assets within the securitization are liquidated, but non-recoverability may also be determined if, in our determination, it is nearly certain that all amounts due will not be collected. The amount is calculated as the difference between the cash received and the historical cost basis of the security. 
 (5) Represents GAAP income from the Woodstar Fund investments excluding unrealized changes in the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities. The amount is calculated as the difference between the Woodstar Fund s GAAP net income and its unrealized gains (losses), which represents changes in working capital and actual cash distributions received. 
 (6) Represents the realized portion of GAAP gains or losses on the termination or settlement of derivatives that are accounted for at fair value. Derivatives are only treated as realized for Distributable Earnings when they are terminated or settled, and cash is exchanged. The amount of cash received or paid to terminate or settle the derivative is the amount treated as realized for Distributable Earnings purposes at the time of such termination or settlement. 
 (7) Represents the realized portion of foreign currency gains (losses) related to assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency. Realization occurs when the foreign currency is converted back to USD. The amount is calculated as the difference between the foreign exchange rate at the time the asset was placed on the balance sheet and the foreign exchange rate at the time cash is received and is offset by any gains or losses on the related foreign currency derivative at settlement. 
 (8) Represents GAAP earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities excluding non-cash items and unrealized changes in fair value recorded on the books and records of the unconsolidated entities. The difference between GAAP and Distributable Earnings for these entities principally relates to depreciation and unrealized changes in the fair value of mortgage loans and securities. 
 (9) Represents the realized gain (loss) on sales of properties held at depreciated cost. Because depreciation is a non-cash expense that is excluded from Distributable Earnings, GAAP gains upon sale of a property are higher, and GAAP losses are lower, than the respective realized amounts reflected in Distributable Earnings. The amount is calculated as net sales proceeds less undepreciated cost, adjusted for any noncontrolling interest.

 Revenues, consisting principally of interest income on loans, decreased by 69.2 million in the nine months of 2024, primarily due to decreases in interest income from loans of 63.9 million and investment securities of 13.1 million, partially offset by a 5.4 million increase in rental income from foreclosed properties. The decrease in interest income from loans reflects (i) a 56.2 million decrease from commercial loans, reflecting lower average balances and additional loans placed on nonaccrual, partially offset by the effects of higher average index rates and prepayment related income, and (ii) a 7.7 million decrease from residential loans principally due to lower average balances. The decrease in interest income from investment securities was primarily due to lower average commercial investment balances due to repayments. 
 Costs and expenses decreased by 71.3 million in the nine months of 2024, primarily due to (i) a 62.3 million decrease in interest expense associated with the various secured financing facilities used to fund a portion of this segment s investment portfolio, reflecting lower average borrowings outstanding due to paydowns from net loan repayments and excess cash balances, partially offset by the effect of higher average index rates, and (ii) the nonrecurrence of a 14.7 million realized credit loss on a commercial loan in the 2023 period, partially offset by (iii) a 6.1 million increase in general and administrative expenses, primarily for compensation and professional fees. 
 Other income increased by 0.9 million in the nine months of 2024.

 Corporate 
 Corporate loss increased by 30.8 million, from 273.2 million during the nine months of 2023 to 304.0 million in the nine months of 2024, primarily due to (i) a 24.2 million increase in interest expense reflecting higher average unsecured borrowings outstanding and higher index rates on our secured term loans and (ii) an 8.3 million increase in realized losses on fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps which hedge a portion of our unsecured senior notes, partially offset by (iii) a 2.2 million decrease in general and administrative expenses. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet our cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, fund and maintain our assets and operations, make new investments where appropriate, pay dividends to our stockholders, and other general business needs. We closely monitor our liquidity position and believe that we have sufficient current liquidity and access to additional liquidity to meet our financial obligations for at least the next 12 months. Our strategy for managing liquidity and capital resources has not changed since December 31, 2023. Refer to our Form 10-K for a description of these strategies.

 The discussion below is on a non-GAAP basis, after removing adjustments principally resulting from the consolidation of the securitization VIEs under ASC 810. These adjustments principally relate to (i) the purchase of CMBS, RMBS, loans and real estate from consolidated VIEs, which are reflected as repayments of VIE debt on a GAAP basis and (ii) sales, principal collections and redemptions of CMBS and RMBS related to consolidated VIEs, which are reflected as VIE distributions on a GAAP basis. There is no net impact to overall cash resulting from these consolidations. Refer to Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 
 Cash and cash equivalents increased by 199.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting net cash provided by investing activities of 1.7 billion and net cash provided by operating activities of 351.0 million, partially offset by net cash used in financing activities of 1.8 billion. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities of 351.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related primarily to cash interest income of 1.2 billion from our loans and 145.0 million from our investment securities, receipts from our interest rate derivatives of 62.2 million, servicing fees of 46.2 million, net rental income of 44.3 million, distributions from our affordable housing fund investments of 38.3 million and sales and principal collections of loans held-for-sale, net of originations and purchases, of 21.3 million. Offsetting these cash inflows was cash interest expense of 994.6 million, general and administrative expenses of 206.3 million and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of 6.0 million.

Net cash provided by investing activities of 1.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related primarily to proceeds received from principal collections and sale of loans held-for-investment of 3.6 billion and investment securities of 142.9 million, as well as net proceeds from the sale of real estate of 216.8 million. Offsetting these cash inflows was the origination, purchase and funding of loans held-for-investment of 2.1 billion and investment securities of 190.6 million. 
 Net cash used in financing activities of 1.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related primarily to payments on our debt and deferred financing costs, net of borrowings, of 1.7 billion and dividend distributions of 457.2 million. Offsetting these cash outflows was the net proceeds from issuances of common stock of 394.9 million.

 (a) Net of 400.0 million proceeds received from the unsecured senior notes that settled in October 2024 (see Note 24 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). 
 In the normal course of business, the Company is in discussions with its lenders to extend, amend or replace any financing facilities which contain near term expirations. 
 
 Issuances of Equity Securities 
 We may raise funds through capital market transactions by issuing capital stock. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to access the capital markets at any particular time or on any particular terms. We have authorized 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock and 500,000,000 shares of common stock. At September 30, 2024, we had 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock available for issuance and 162,784,073 shares of common stock available for issuance. 
 Other Potential Sources of Financing 
 In the future, we may also use other sources of financing to fund the acquisition of our target assets and maturities of our unsecured senior notes, including other secured as well as unsecured forms of borrowing and sale of senior loan interests and other assets. 
 Leverage Policies 
 Our strategies with regards to use of leverage have not changed significantly since December 31, 2023. Refer to our Form 10-K for a description of our strategies regarding use of leverage. 
 
 Cash Requirements 
 Dividends 
 U.S. federal income tax law generally requires that a REIT distribute annually at least 90 of its REIT taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and that it pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it annually distributes less than 100 of its net taxable income. We generally intend to distribute substantially all of our taxable income (which does not necessarily equal our GAAP net income) to our stockholders each year, if and to the extent authorized by our board of directors. Before we pay any dividend, whether for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise, we must first meet both our operating and debt service requirements. If our cash available for distribution is less than our net taxable income, we could be required to sell assets or borrow funds to make cash distributions or we may make a portion of the required distribution in the form of a taxable stock distribution or distribution of debt securities. Refer to Note 17 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and our Form 10-K for a detailed dividend history.

 (a) Represents the contractual maturity of the respective credit facility, inclusive of available extension options. If investments that have been pledged as collateral repay earlier than the contractual maturity of the debt, the related portion of the debt would likewise require earlier repayment. Refer to Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the expected maturities by year. 
 
 (b) Represents the fully extended maturity of the underlying collateral. 
 
 (c) Excludes 278.2 million of loan funding commitments in which management projects the Company will not be obligated to fund in the future due to repayments made by the borrower earlier than, or in excess of, expectations. Includes 86.0 million of future funding now considered probable under a loan guarantee arrangement (see Note 22 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). 
 
 (d) Represents contractual commitments of 37.7 million under revolvers and letters of credit, 127.5 million under delayed draw term loans and 351.3 million of outstanding infrastructure loan purchase commitments. 
 The table above does not include interest payable, amounts due under our management agreement, amounts due under our derivative agreements or amounts due under guarantees as those contracts do not have fixed and determinable payments. 
 Our secured financings, CLOs and SASB consist primarily of matched-term funding for our loans and investment securities and long-term mortgages on our owned properties. Repayments of such facilities are generally made from proceeds from maturities, prepayments or sales of such investments and operating cash flows from owned properties. In the normal course of business, we are in discussions with our lenders to extend, amend or replace any financing facilities which contain near term expirations. 
 Our unsecured senior notes are expected to be repaid from a combination of available cash on hand, approved but undrawn capacity under our secured financing agreements, and/or equity issuances or other potential sources of financing, as discussed above, including issuances of new unsecured senior notes. 
 Our future loan commitments are expected to be primarily matched-term funded under secured financing agreements with any difference funded from available cash on hand or other potential sources of financing discussed above.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We seek to manage our risks related to the credit quality of our assets, interest rates, liquidity, prepayment speeds and market value while, at the same time, seeking to provide an opportunity to stockholders to realize attractive risk-adjusted returns through ownership of our capital stock. While we do not seek to avoid risk completely, we believe the risk can be quantified from historical experience and seek to actively manage that risk, to earn sufficient compensation to justify taking those risks and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risks we undertake. Our strategies for managing risk and our exposure to such risks, as described in Item 7A of our Form 10-K, have not changed materially since December 31, 2023 except as described below. 
 Credit Risk 
 Our loans and investments are subject to credit risk. The performance and value of our loans and investments depend upon the owners ability to operate the properties that serve as our collateral so that they produce cash flows adequate to pay interest and principal due to us. To monitor this risk, our asset management team reviews our investment portfolios and is in regular contact with our borrowers, monitoring performance of the collateral and enforcing our rights as necessary. 
 We seek to further manage credit risk associated with our Investing and Servicing Segment loans held-for-sale through the purchase of credit instruments. The following table presents our credit instruments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands): 
 Face Value of Loans Held-for-Sale Aggregate Notional Value of Credit Instruments Number of Credit Instruments September 30, 2024 238,410 79,000 5 December 31, 2023 45,400 49,000 3

Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including fiscal and monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political considerations, as well as other factors beyond our control. We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our investments and the related financing obligations. In general, we seek to match the interest rate characteristics of our investments with the interest rate characteristics of any related financing obligations such as repurchase agreements, bank credit facilities, term loans, revolving facilities and securitizations. In instances where the interest rate characteristics of an investment and the related financing obligation are not matched, we mitigate such interest rate risk through the utilization of interest rate derivatives of the same duration. As discussed in Note 13 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we entered into a series of derivative transactions during the three months ended June 30, 2024 related to our residential loan portfolio in an effort to extend hedge duration. These transactions involved a series of reverse swap trades which effectively locked a portion of positive cash flows from our original hedges for a period of time. We simultaneously entered into a forward starting swap which will not be effective until June 2027. While the fair value of the forward starting swap will impact earnings, it will not impact net investment income until its effective date. 
 The following table presents financial instruments where we have utilized interest rate derivatives to hedge interest rate risk and the related interest rate derivatives as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands); however, consistent with Note 13 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the notional value and number of credit instruments excludes the residential lending reverse swap trades and forward starting swaps as well as certain other interest rate swaps that were not effective as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: Face Value of Hedged Instruments Aggregate Notional Value of Credit Instruments Number of Credit Instruments Instrument hedged as of September 30, 2024 Loans held-for-sale 2,980,201 3,754,000 51 RMBS, available-for-sale 182,821 40,000 1 CMBS, fair value option 138,901 74,680 4 HTM debt securities 7,955 7,955 1 Secured financing agreements 545,313 1,169,333 8 Unsecured senior notes 1,600,000 1,570,000 3 5,455,191 6,615,968 68 Instrument hedged as of December 31, 2023 Loans held-for-sale 2,954,526 3,646,500 43 RMBS, available-for-sale 191,916 85,000 2 CMBS, fair value option 67,433 58,800 2 HTM debt securities 9,629 9,629 1 Secured financing agreements 716,786 1,358,775 8 Unsecured senior notes 1,000,000 970,000 2 4,940,290 6,128,704 58 
 The table below summarizes the estimated annual change in net investment income for our variable rate investments and our variable rate debt assuming increases or decreases in SOFR or other applicable index rates and adjusted for the effects of our interest rate hedging activities (amounts in thousands). However, this table excludes our floating rate residential loan debt along with its related hedges. As discussed in Note 13 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and above, the reverse swap trades represent locked positive cash flows, and the forward starting swap will not impact net investment income until June 2027. Once the reverse swap trades expire and the forward starting swap becomes effective (i.e. when it affects net investment income), we will again include these in our interest rate sensitivity. Also consistent with Note 13 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and above, this table also excludes certain other interest rate swaps that were not effective as of September 30, 2024.

Foreign Currency Risk 
 Our loans and investments that are denominated in a foreign currency are also subject to risks related to fluctuations in exchange rates. We generally mitigate this exposure by matching the currency of our foreign currency assets to the currency of the borrowings that finance those assets. As a result, we substantially reduce our exposure to changes in portfolio value related to changes in foreign exchange rates. 
 We intend to hedge our net currency exposures in a prudent manner. However, our currency hedging strategies may not eliminate all of our currency risk due to, among other things, uncertainties in the timing and/or amount of payments received on the related investments, and/or unequal, inaccurate, or unavailable hedges to perfectly offset changes in future exchange rates. Additionally, we may be required under certain circumstances to collateralize our currency hedges for the benefit of the hedge counterparty, which could adversely affect our liquidity. 
 Consistent with our strategy of hedging foreign currency exposure on certain investments, we typically enter into a series of forwards to fix the U.S. dollar amount of foreign currency denominated cash flows (interest income and principal payments) we expect to receive from our foreign currency denominated investments. Accordingly, the notional values and expiration dates of our foreign currency hedges approximate the amounts and timing of future payments we expect to receive on the related investments. 
 The following table represents our assets and liabilities that are denominated in Pounds Sterling GBP ), Euros EUR ), Australian dollars AUD and Swiss Francs CHF ), as well as our expected future net interest receipts (amounts in thousands): September 30, 2024

 Substantially all of our net asset exposure to the GBP, EUR, AUD and CHF has been hedged with foreign currency forward contracts as of September 30, 2024, as indicated in the table above. Refer to Note 13 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail regarding our foreign currency derivatives and their contractual maturities. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures. We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. No change in internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
