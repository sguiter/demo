War in Ukraine 
 In February 2022, Russia began a military invasion of Ukraine and we closed our operations and facilities in Ukraine. In March 2022, our Ukrainian manufacturing facilities in Trostyanets and Vyshhorod were significantly damaged. In the second quarter of 2024, we fully resumed production at both facilities after completing targeted repairs. We continue to consolidate both our Ukrainian and Russian subsidiaries and continue to evaluate our ability to control our operating activities and businesses on an ongoing basis. We continue to evaluate the uncertainty of the ongoing effects of the war in Ukraine and its impact on the global economic environment, and we cannot predict if it will have a significant impact in the future. 
 
 Argentina and T rkiye represent and of our consolidated net revenues with remeasurement losses of million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and and of our consolidated net revenues with remeasurement losses of million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . Given the continued volatility of these currencies, impacts to our financial statements in future periods could be significantly different from historical levels. 
 
 Restricted cash is recorded within other current assets and was million as of September 30, 2024 and million as of December 31, 2023. Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was million as of September 30, 2024 and million as of December 31, 2023.

The proceeds from the sales of receivables are included in cash from operating activities in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. 
 
 Non-Cash Lease Transactions 
 We recorded million in operating lease and million in finance lease right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and million in operating lease and million in finance lease right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 We have been informed by the participating financial institutions that our outstanding accounts payable related to suppliers that participate in the SCF programs was billion and billion, respectively, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 We reversed million of previously recorded divestiture-related costs no longer required in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and recorded divestiture-related costs of million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 and recorded net divestiture-related costs of million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 (2) million of intangible asset impairment charges related to biscuit brands in the Europe segment for million, biscuit brand in the AMEA segment for million and candy and biscuit brand in the Latin America segment for a total of million. 
 
 Indefinite-life intangible assets consist principally of brand names purchased through our acquisitions of Nabisco Holdings Corp., the global LU biscuit business of Groupe Danone S.A., Cadbury Limited and Clif Bar. Definite-life intangible assets consist primarily of trademarks, customer-related intangibles, process technology, licenses and non-compete agreements. 
 
 Amortization expense for intangible assets was million for the three months and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and million for the three months and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the next five years, we currently estimate annual amortization expense of approximately million in 2024-2026 and approximately million in 2027 and 2028 (reflecting September 30, 2024 exchange rates). 
 
 Impairment Assessment: 
 We test our reporting units and brands for impairment annually as of July 1, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or brand is less than its carrying amount. During the third quarter of 2024, we performed our annual impairment assessment test for goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets as of July 1, 2024. 
 
 Our 2024 annual testing of goodwill resulted in impairments as each reporting unit had fair value in excess of carrying value. As part of our goodwill quantitative assessment, we compare a reporting unit's estimated fair value to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, we would record an impairment for the difference. We estimate a reporting unit's fair value using a discounted cash flow method that incorporates discount rates, planned growth rates, and estimates of residual value. We used a market-based weighted average cost of capital of for our Europe and North America reporting units and a risk-rated weighted average cost of capital of for our Latin America and AMEA reporting units, to discount projected cash flows from those operations. Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates

 million related to biscuit brands in the Europe segment, biscuit brand in the AMEA segment and candy and biscuit brand in the Latin America segment. The impairments were driven by changes in projections, resulting primarily from the impact of customer price negotiation disruptions and continued commodity cost pressures in the third quarter of 2024, which are expected to result in a slower recovery than previously expected. The impairment charges were calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the intangible assets on a global basis and were recorded within asset impairment and exit costs. 
 
 We use several accepted valuation methods, including Relief from Royalty, excess earnings and excess margin. The valuation methods utilize estimates of future sales, earnings growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates to determine the fair value of each intangible asset. We identified brands that each had a fair value in excess of book value of 10 or less. The aggregate book value of the brands was billion as of September 30, 2024. We believe our current plans for each of these brands will allow them to not be impaired, but if plans to grow brand revenue and expand margin are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change then a brand or brands could become impaired in the future. 

of the outstanding shares, resulting in a change of accounting for our KDP investment, from equity method investment accounting to accounting for equity interests with readily determinable fair values ("marketable securities") as we no longer had significant influence over KDP. Marketable securities are measured at fair value based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1). 
 
 On July 13, 2023, we sold million shares, the remainder of our shares of KDP. We received proceeds of approximately million. 
 
 On June 8, 2023, we sold million shares of KDP, which reduced our ownership by percentage points, from to of the total outstanding shares. We received proceeds of approximately million. 
 
 On March 2, 2023, we sold million shares of KDP, which reduced our ownership by percentage points, from to of the total outstanding shares. We received proceeds of approximately billion and prior to the change of accounting for our KDP investment, recorded a pre-tax gain on equity method transactions of million million after-tax) during the first quarter of 2023.

 , and , respectively, of these companies' outstanding shares. We continue to have board representation with directors on JDEP's Board of Directors and have retained certain additional governance rights. As we continue to have significant influence, we continue to account for our investment in JDEP under the equity method. 
 
 Our investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting totaled billion as of September 30, 2024 and billion as of December 31, 2023. We recorded equity earnings of million and cash dividends of million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, and equity earnings of million and cash dividends of million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. We recorded equity earnings of million and cash dividends of million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and equity earnings of million and cash dividends of million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Based on the quoted closing prices as of September 30, 2024, the fair value of our publicly-traded investment in JDEP was billion, and there was other than temporary impairment identified during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we determined there was an other-than-temporary impairment based on the period of time for which the quoted market price fair value had been less than the carrying value of the investment and the uncertainty surrounding JDEP's stock price recovering to the carrying value. As a result, the investment was written down to its estimated fair value based on the closing price of the underlying equity security of per share on March 28, 2024, resulting in an impairment charge of million million). This charge was included within (Loss)/gain on equity method investment transactions including impairments in the condensed consolidated statement of earnings. There was other than temporary impairment identified in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 JDEP Transactions 
 On March 30, 2023, we issued options to sell shares of JDEP in tranches equivalent to approximately million shares. These options were exercisable at their maturities which were between July 3, 2023 and September 29, 2023, with strike prices ranging from to per share. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, options were exercised on million shares, which reduced our ownership percentage by percentage point, from to of the total outstanding shares. We received cash proceeds of million million) and recorded a loss of million million) for these shares during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 On April 3, 2023, we sold approximately million shares of JDEP, which reduced our ownership by percentage points, from to of the total outstanding shares. We received cash proceeds of million million) and recorded a loss of million million) on this sale during the during the second quarter of 2023. 
 
 In 2021, we issued million exchangeable bonds, which were redeemable at maturity during September 2024 at their principal amount in cash or, at our option, through the delivery of an equivalent number of JDEP s ordinary shares based on an initial exchange price of and, as the case may be, an additional amount in cash. At maturity, we repaid the exchangeable bonds in cash. Refer to Note 8, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements for additional detail on this repayment. 
 
 On October 21, 2024, we announced the sale of our remaining million shares in JDEP to JAB Holdings Company for approximately billion billion), at a price of per share. The sale transaction is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2024.

On September 6, 2018, our Board of Directors approved an extension

 billion in the program charges and an increase of million in capital expenditures. On October 21, 2021, our Board of Directors approved an extension of the restructuring program through 2023, and on July 25, 2023, our Board of Directors approved a further extension of the restructuring program through December 31, 2024. The total billion program now consists of billion of program charges billion of cash costs and billion of non-cash costs) and total capital expenditures of billion to be incurred over the life of the program. The current restructuring program, as increased and extended by these actions, is now called the Simplify to Grow Program. 
 
 The primary objective of the Simplify to Grow Program is to reduce our operating cost structure in both our supply chain and overhead costs. The program covers severance as well as asset disposals and other manufacturing and procurement-related one-time costs. Since inception, we have incurred total restructuring and implementation charges of billion related to the Simplify to Grow Program. We expect to incur the remainder of the program charges by year-end 2024.

 Implementation Costs 
 Implementation costs are directly attributable to restructuring activities; however, they do not qualify for special accounting treatment as exit or disposal activities. We believe the disclosure of implementation costs provides readers of our financial statements with additional information on the total costs of our Simplify to Grow Program. Implementation costs primarily relate to reorganizing our operations and facilities in connection with our supply chain reinvention program and other identified productivity and cost saving initiatives. The costs include incremental expenses related to the closure of facilities, costs to terminate certain contracts and the simplification of our information systems. Within our continuing results of operations, we recorded implementation costs of million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, and we recorded implementation costs of million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We recorded these costs within cost of sales and general corporate expense within selling, general and administrative expenses.

 Level 1 financial assets and liabilities consist of exchange-traded commodity futures and listed options. The fair value of these instruments is determined based on quoted market prices on commodity exchanges. 
 
 Level 2 financial assets and liabilities consist primarily of over-the-counter OTC currency exchange forwards, options and swaps; commodity forwards and options; net investment hedge contracts; and interest rate swaps. Our currency exchange contracts are valued using an income approach based on observable market forward rates less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Commodity derivatives are valued using an income approach based on the observable market commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount or based on pricing models that rely on market observable inputs such as commodity prices. Our calculation of the fair value of interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the observable market interest rate curve. Our calculation of the fair value of financial instruments takes into consideration the risk of nonperformance, including counterparty credit risk. Our OTC derivative transactions are governed by International Swap Dealers Association agreements and other standard industry contracts. Under these agreements, we do not post nor require collateral from our counterparties. The majority of our derivative contracts do not have a legal right of set-off. We manage the credit risk in connection with these and all our derivatives by entering into transactions with counterparties with investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Overview of Business and Strategy 
 
 Our core business is making and selling chocolate, biscuits and baked snacks, with additional businesses in adjacent, locally relevant categories including gum candy, cheese grocery and powdered beverages around the world. 
 
 We aim to be the global leader in snacking. Our strategy is to drive long-term growth by focusing on four strategic priorities: accelerating consumer-centric growth, driving operational excellence, creating a winning growth culture and scaling sustainable snacking. We believe the successful implementation of our strategic priorities and leveraging of our attractive global footprint, strong core of iconic global and local brands, marketing, sales, distribution and cost excellence capabilities, and top talent with a growth mindset, will drive consistent top- and bottom-line growth, enabling us to continue to create long-term value for our shareholders. 

Recent Developments and Significant Items Affecting Comparability 
 
 Macroeconomic environment 
 
 We continue to observe significant market and geopolitical uncertainty, fluctuating consumer demand, inflationary pressures, supply constraints and exchange rate volatility. As a result, we experienced significantly higher operating costs, including higher overall raw material, labor and energy costs that have continued to rise. In particular, we expect to continue to face higher cocoa costs, as the market price for cocoa beans has increased significantly year-over-year and it is likely that prices will remain elevated for some time. Refer to Commodity Trends for additional information. 
 
 Our overall outlook for future snacks revenue growth remains strong; however, we anticipate ongoing volatility. We will continue to proactively manage our business in response to the evolving global economic environment, related uncertainty and business risks while also prioritizing and supporting our employees and customers. We continue to take steps to mitigate impacts to our supply chain, operations, technology and assets. 
 
 War in Ukraine 
 
 In February 2022, following the Russian military invasion of Ukraine, we stopped production and closed our facilities in Ukraine; since then we have taken steps to protect the safety of our employees and to fully restore operations at our two manufacturing facilities, which were significantly damaged in March 2022. See Note 1, Basis of Presentation - War in Ukraine , to the condensed consolidated financial statements, and refer to Items Affecting Comparability of Financial Results for additional information. 
 
 We have suspended new capital investments and our advertising spending in Russia, but as a food company with more than 2,500 employees in the country, we have not ceased operations given we believe we play a role in the continuity of the food supply. We continue to evaluate the situation in Ukraine and Russia and our ability to control our operating activities and businesses on an ongoing basis and comply with applicable international sanctions. We continue to consolidate both our Ukrainian and Russian subsidiaries. During the third quarter of 2024, Ukraine generated 0.4 and Russia generated 2.9 of consolidated net revenue and during the third quarter of 2023, Ukraine generated 0.4 and Russia generated 2.7 of consolidated net revenue. The profitability of and the assets held by our Russian business continue to remain above historical levels. We cannot predict if the recent performance of our Russian business will continue in the future. 
 
 Our operations in Russia are subject to risks, including the temporary or permanent loss of assets due to expropriation or further curtailment of our ability to conduct business operations in Russia. In the event this were to occur, this could lead to the partial or full impairment of our Russian assets or deconsolidation of the operations in Russia in future periods, or the termination of our business operations, based on actions taken by Russia, other parties or us. For additional information, see the risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, including the risk entitled The war in Ukraine has impacted and could continue to impact our business operations, financial performance and results of operations.

 Developments in the Middle East 
 
 In October 2023, conflict developed in the Middle East between Hamas and Israel, and has expanded to other parts of the region. In the third quarter of 2024, we experienced sales impacts related to this conflict in certain AMEA markets, but this did not have a material impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We continue to evaluate the impacts of these developments on our business and we cannot predict if it will have a significant impact in the future. 
 
 ERP System Implementation 
 
 In July 2024, our Board of Directors approved funding of 1.2 billion for a multi-year systems transformation program to upgrade our global ERP and supply chain systems (the ERP System Implementation ). The ERP System Implementation spending comprises both capital expenditures and operating expenses, of which a majority is expected to relate to operating expenses. The operating expenses associated with the ERP System Implementation represent incremental transformational costs above the normal ongoing level of spending on information technology to support operations. The ERP System Implementation program will be implemented by region in several phases with spending occurring over the next five years, with expected completion by year-end 2028. Refer to Non-GAAP financial measures for additional information. 
 
 Extreme Price Growth in Argentina 
 
 During December 2023, the Argentinean peso significantly devalued. The peso's devaluation and potential resulting distortion on our non-GAAP Organic Net Revenue, Organic Net Revenue growth and other constant currency growth rate measures resulted in our decision to exclude the impact of pricing in excess of 26 year-over-year ("extreme pricing") in Argentina, from these measures beginning in Q1 2024. The benchmark of 26 represents the minimum annual inflation rate for each year over a 3-year period which would result in a cumulative inflation rate in excess of 100 , the level at which an economy is considered hyperinflationary under U.S. GAAP. Throughout the following MD A discussion, we now exclude, on a prospective basis, the impact of extreme pricing in Argentina from the net pricing impact of Organic Net Revenue and Organic Net Revenue growth and its related impact on our other non-GAAP financial constant currency growth measures with a corresponding adjustment in changes in currency translation rates. Additionally within the MD A discussion, "currency-related items" totals the impact of extreme pricing and the currency translation rate changes. Refer to Non-GAAP financial measures for additional information. 
 
 Currency-related items impacted our non-GAAP financial measures for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as follows: 
 Organic Net Revenue: In total, unfavorable currency-related items of 120 million (1.4 pp) were driven by unfavorable currency translation rate changes of 393 million (4.4 pp), partially offset by the adjustment for extreme pricing of 273 million (3.0 pp). In Emerging Markets, unfavorable currency-related items of 170 million (4.8 pp) were driven by unfavorable currency translation rate changes of 443 million (12.6 pp), partially offset by the adjustment for extreme pricing of 273 million (7.8 pp). In Developed Markets, favorable currency-related items of 50 million (1.0 pp) were driven by favorable currency translation rate changes. 
 Adjusted Operating Income: Unfavorable currency-related items of 16 million were driven by unfavorable currency translation rate changes of 64 million, partially offset by the adjustment for extreme pricing of 48 million. 
 Adjusted EPS: Unfavorable currency-related items were flat as unfavorable currency translation rate changes of 0.04 were offset by the adjustment for extreme pricing of 0.04. 
 
 Currency-related items impacted our non-GAAP financial measures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as follows: 
 Organic Net Revenue: In total, unfavorable currency-related items of 468 million (1.7 pp) were driven by unfavorable currency translation rate changes of 1,450 million (5.5 pp), partially offset by the adjustment for extreme pricing of 982 million (3.8 pp). In Emerging Markets, unfavorable currency-related items of 529 million (5.1 pp) were driven by unfavorable currency translation rate changes of 1,511 million (14.5 pp), partially offset by the adjustment for extreme pricing of 982 million (9.4 pp). In Developed Markets, favorable currency-related items of 61 million (0.4 pp) were driven by favorable currency translation rate changes.

 Acquisitions and Divestitures 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, we announced a signed agreement to acquire a majority stake of Evirth (Shanghai) Industrial Co., Ltd, a leading manufacturer of cakes and pastries in China. Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures , for additional details. 
 
 In 2022, we announced our intention to divest our developed market gum and global Halls candy businesses and in the fourth quarter of 2022, we announced an agreement to sell the developed market gum business. On October 1, 2023, we completed the sale of our developed market gum business to Perfetti Van Melle Group, excluding the Portugal business which we retained pending regulatory approval. We completed the sale of the Portugal business to Perfetti Van Melle Group on October 23, 2023. Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures , for additional details. 
 
 Investment Transactions 
 
 Keurig Dr Pepper Transactions (Nasdaq: "KDP") 
 During the first quarter of 2023, we sold approximately 30 million shares of KDP, which reduced our ownership interest to 3.2 . We recorded a pre-tax gain on equity method transactions of 493 million (or 368 million after-tax). Our reduction in ownership to below 5 resulted in a change of accounting from equity method investment accounting to accounting for equity interests with readily determinable fair values ("marketable securities"). On June 8, 2023, we sold 23 million shares of KDP, which reduced our ownership to 1.6 . On July 13, 2023, we sold our remaining 23 million shares and received approximately 704 million in proceeds. 
 
 JDE Peet s Transactions (Euronext Amsterdam: JDEP 
 During the first quarter of 2023, we sold approximately 7.7 million shares of JDEP, which reduced our ownership to 18.1 . We recorded a loss of 18 million 19 million) on this sale. On March 30, 2023, we issued options to sell shares of JDEP in tranches equivalent to approximately 7.7 million shares, exercisable at maturity during the third quarter of 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, options were exercised on 2.2 million shares, which reduced our ownership percentage by 0.4 percentage point, from 18.1 to 17.7 of the total outstanding shares. We recorded a loss of 3 million 4 million) on this sale. 
 
 During the first quarter of 2024, we determined there was an other-than-temporary impairment of our investment in JDEP, resulting in an impairment charge of 612 million 665 million). On October 21, 2024, we announced the sale of our remaining 85.9 million shares in JDEP to JAB Holdings Company for approximately 2.2 billion 2.4 billion). The sale transaction is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2024.

 As of October 2024, the Company intends to terminate the Mondel z Global LLC Retirement Plan. The termination process is expected to be completed as of June 30, 2025. Refer to Note 10, Benefit Plans for additional information. 
 
 Taxes 
 
 We continue to monitor existing and potential future tax reform around the world. As of September 30, 2024, numerous countries have now enacted the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development s model rules on a global minimum tax with the earliest effective date being for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2023. Based on the guidance available thus far, we do not expect this legislation to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements but we will continue to evaluate it as additional guidance and clarification becomes available.

 Financial Outlook 
 
 We seek to achieve profitable, long-term growth and manage our business to attain this goal using our key operating metrics: Organic Net Revenue, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted EPS. We use these non-GAAP financial metrics and related computations, particularly growth in profit dollars, to evaluate and manage our business and to plan and make near- and long-term operating and strategic decisions. As such, we believe these metrics are useful to investors as they provide supplemental information in addition to our U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("U.S. GAAP") financial results. We believe it is useful to provide investors with the same financial information that we use internally to make comparisons of our historical operating results, identify trends in our underlying operating results and evaluate our business. We believe our non-GAAP financial measures should always be considered in relation to our U.S. GAAP results. Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures for the definitions of our non-GAAP financial measures and Consolidated Results of Operations for the respective reconciliations. 
 
 In addition to monitoring our key operating metrics, we monitor developments and trends that could impact our revenue and profitability objectives, as highlighted in our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Summary of Results 
 
 Net revenues increased 1.9 to 9.2 billion in the third quarter of 2024 and increased 0.5 to 26.8 billion in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the same periods in the prior year. 
 Net revenue growth in the third quarter of 2024 was driven by higher net pricing and favorable volume mix, partially offset by the impact of our 2023 divestiture of the developed market gum business and unfavorable currency-related items, as the U.S. dollar strengthened relative to most currencies we operate in compared to exchange rates in the prior year. 
 Net revenue growth in the first nine months of 2024 was driven by higher net pricing and incremental net revenue from a short-term distributor agreement related to the sale of our developed market gum business, partially offset by the impact of our 2023 divestiture of the developed market gum business, unfavorable currency-related items, as the U.S. dollar strengthened relative to most currencies we operate in compared to exchange rates in the prior year and unfavorable volume/mix. 
 Organic Net Revenue, a non-GAAP financial measure, increased 5.4 to 9.3 billion in the third quarter of 2024 and increased 4.0 to 27.3 billion in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the same periods in the prior year. During the third quarter Organic Net Revenue grew due to higher net pricing and favorable volume/mix. During the first nine months of 2024, Organic Net Revenue grew due to higher net pricing, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix. Organic Net Revenue is on a constant currency basis and excludes revenue from acquisitions and divestitures. Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures for the definition of Organic Net Revenue and Consolidated Results of Operations for our reconciliation with net revenues. 
 Diluted EPS attributable to Mondel z International decreased (12.5) to 0.63 in the third quarter of 2024 and decreased (27.4) to 2.12 in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the same periods in the prior year. 
 Diluted EPS decreased in the third quarter of 2024, driven by an unfavorable year-over-year change in mark-to-market impacts from commodity and currency derivatives, higher intangible asset impairment charges, lapping prior-year operating results from the developed market gum business divested in 2023, costs incurred for the ERP Systems Implementation program and lapping prior-year gain on marketable securities. These unfavorable items were partially offset by an increase in Adjusted EPS, favorable year-over-year change in acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments, lower equity method investee items, favorable year-over-year change in initial impacts from enacted tax law changes and lower loss on remeasurement of net monetary position. 
 Diluted EPS decreased in the first nine months of 2024, driven by an impairment charge on our JDEP equity method investment in 2024, lapping prior-year net gains on marketable securities and equity method investment transactions primarily related to our former KDP investment, unfavorable year-over-year change in mark-to-market impacts from commodity and currency derivatives, lapping prior-year operating results from the developed market gum business divested in 2023, higher intangible asset impairment charges, costs incurred for the ERP Systems Implementation program and higher costs incurred from our Simplify to Grow program. These unfavorable items were partially offset by an increase in Adjusted EPS, favorable year-over-year change in acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments, lower divestiture-related costs, lower loss on remeasurement of net monetary position and lower equity method investee items. 
 Adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP financial measure, increased 28.6 to 0.99 in the third quarter of 2024 and increased 19.1 to 2.80 in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the same periods in the prior year. On a constant currency basis, Adjusted EPS increased 28.6 to 0.99 in the third quarter of 2024 and increased 23.0 to 2.89 in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the same periods in the prior year. Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures for the definition of Adjusted EPS and Consolidated Results of Operations for our reconciliation with diluted EPS. 
 Adjusted EPS increased in the third quarter of 2024, driven by operating gains, fewer shares outstanding, lower interest expense and lower taxes. 
 Adjusted EPS increased in the first nine months of 2024, driven by operating gains, fewer shares outstanding, lower interest expense and higher benefit plan non-service income, partially offset by unfavorable currency-related items, higher taxes and lapping prior year dividend income related to our former KDP investment.

 Net revenue increase of 1.9 was driven by our underlying Organic Net Revenue growth of 5.4 , partially offset by the impact of our 2023 divestiture of the developed market gum business and unfavorable currency-related items. Organic Net Revenue growth was driven by higher net pricing and favorable volume/mix. Higher net pricing in all regions was due to the benefit of carryover pricing from 2023 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during the first nine months of 2024. Overall, positive volume/mix reflected improved volume trends in North America due to increased consumer demand in the U.S. as well as Europe rebounding from last quarter's customer price negotiation disruptions. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in North America, Europe and AMEA, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix in Latin America. The impact of our 2023 divestiture of the developed market gum business resulted in a year-over-year reduction in net revenues of 179 million for the third quarter of 2024. Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures, for additional information. Currency-related items decreased net revenues by 120 million, driven by unfavorable currency translation rate changes, partially offset by the adjustment for extreme pricing in Argentina. Refer to Recent Developments and Significant Items Affecting Comparability for additional information. Unfavorable currency translation rate changes were due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies, primarily the Argentinean peso, as well as the Brazilian real, Mexican peso, Nigerian naira, Egyptian pound and Turkish lira, partially offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the British pound sterling, euro, Russian ruble, Polish zloty, Australian dollar and Chinese yuan.

 During the third quarter of 2024, we realized higher net pricing and favorable volume/mix, which were partially offset by increased input costs. Higher net pricing, which included the carryover impact of pricing actions taken in 2023 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during the first nine months of 2024, was reflected across all regions. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in Europe and North America, partially offset by declines in Latin America and AMEA. The increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs due to productivity. Higher raw material costs were in part due to higher cocoa, sugar, nuts, dairy and other ingredient costs, as well as unfavorable year-over-year currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials, partially offset by lower energy, edible oils, packaging, and grains costs. 
 
 Total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 389 million from the third quarter of 2023, which was net of benefits from a number of factors noted in the table above, including in part, a favorable contingent consideration adjustment related to the Clif Bar acquisition and lower acquisition integration costs, the elimination of costs from the developed market gum business divested in 2023, a favorable currency translation impact related to expenses, lower divestiture-related costs and lower remeasurement loss of net monetary position, partially offset by costs incurred for the ERP System Implementation program and higher implementation costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow program. Excluding these factors, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 53 million from the third quarter of 2023. The increase was driven primarily by higher advertising and consumer promotion costs and higher overhead costs in part due to increased investments in route to market capabilities. 
 
 Unfavorable currency-related items, net of the adjustment for extreme pricing in Argentina, decreased operating income by 16 million primarily due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies, including the Argentinean peso, Brazilian real, Egyptian pound and Mexican peso, partially offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the British pound sterling, Russian ruble and euro. 
 
 Operating income margin decreased from 15.3 in the third quarter of 2023 to 12.5 in the third quarter of 2024. The decrease in operating income margin was driven primarily by the unfavorable year-over-year change in mark-to-market gains/(losses) from commodity and currency hedging activities, higher intangible asset impairment charges, the impact from the developed market gum business divested in 2023 and costs incurred for the ERP System Implementation program, partially offset by favorable year-over-year change in acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments, higher Adjusted Operating Income margin, lower divestiture-related costs, lower remeasurement loss of net monetary position and lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow program. Adjusted Operating Income margin increased from 16.2 for the third quarter of 2023 to 18.9 for the third quarter of 2024. The increase was driven primarily by higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs driven by productivity and overhead cost leverage, partially offset by higher raw material costs.

 Net revenue increase of 0.5 was driven by our underlying Organic Net Revenue growth of 4.0 and the impact of a short-term distributor agreement, partially offset by the impact of our 2023 divestiture of the developed market gum business and unfavorable currency-related items. Organic Net Revenue growth was driven by higher net pricing, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix. Higher net pricing in all regions was due to the benefit of carryover pricing from 2023 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during the first nine months of 2024. Overall, unfavorable volume/mix was driven by volume declines, due to the impact of expected customer price negotiation disruptions in Europe, softer consumer demand in the U.S. and Mexico and geopolitical impacts in parts of AMEA, which were partially offset by favorable product mix. Unfavorable volume/mix was reflected across all regions. The short-term distributor agreement related to the October 1, 2023 sale of our developed market gum business added incremental net revenues of 25 million for the first nine months of 2024. The impact of our 2023 divestiture of the developed market gum business resulted in a year-over-year reduction in net revenues of 483 million for the first nine months of 2024. Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures, for additional information. Currency-related items decreased net revenues by 468 million, driven by unfavorable currency translation rate changes, partially offset by the adjustment for extreme pricing in Argentina. Refer to Recent Developments and Significant Items Affecting Comparability for additional information. Unfavorable currency translation rate changes were due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies, primarily the

The increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs driven by productivity. Higher raw material costs were in part due to higher cocoa, sugar, nuts and other ingredient costs, as well as unfavorable year-over-year currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials, partially offset by lower energy, dairy, edible oils, grains and packaging costs. Overall, unfavorable volume/mix was due to volume declines partially offset by favorable product mix. Unfavorable volume/mix was experienced in all regions. 
 
 Total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 284 million from the first nine months of 2023, which was net of benefits from a number of factors noted in the table above, including in part, a favorable contingent consideration adjustment related to the Clif Bar acquisition and lower acquisition integration costs, the elimination of costs from the developed market gum business divested in 2023, lower divestiture-related costs, lower remeasurement loss of net monetary position and a favorable currency translation impact related to expenses, marginally offset by costs incurred for the ERP System Implementation program and higher implementation costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow program. Excluding these factors, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 270 million from the first nine months of 2023. The increase was driven primarily by higher advertising and consumer promotion costs and higher overhead costs in part due to increased investments in route to market capabilities. 
 
 Unfavorable currency changes, net of the adjustment for extreme pricing in Argentina, decreased operating income by 143 million primarily due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies, including the Argentinean peso, Russian ruble, Egyptian pound, Chinese yuan, Turkish lira and Nigerian naira, partially offset by the strength of a few currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the British pound sterling, Polish zloty, euro and Mexican peso. 
 
 Operating income margin increased from 16.1 in the first nine months of 2023 to 17.6 in the first nine months of 2024. The increase was driven primarily by higher Adjusted Operating Income margin, favorable year-over-year change in acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments, lower divestiture-related costs and lower remeasurement loss of net monetary position, partially offset by unfavorable year-over-year change in mark-to-market gains/(losses) from commodity and currency hedging activities, the impact from the developed market gum business divested in 2023, costs incurred for the ERP System Implementation program and higher costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow program. Adjusted Operating Income margin increased from 16.1 for the first nine months of 2023 to 18.4 for the first nine months of 2024. The increase was driven primarily by higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs driven by productivity and overhead leverage, partially offset by higher raw material costs and higher advertising and consumer promotion costs.

 Three Months Ended September 30: 
 
 Net revenues decreased 101 million (7.7 ), due to an unfavorable impact of currency-related items (9.7 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (3.9 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (5.9 pp). Currency-related items were unfavorable, net of the adjustment for extreme pricing in Argentina, due to currency translation rate changes. Unfavorable currency translation impacts were primarily due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies in the region, primarily the Argentinean peso, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. Overall, unfavorable volume/mix reflected consumer softness, primarily in Mexico. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in chocolate, candy, cheese grocery and refreshment beverages, partially offset by gains in biscuits baked snacks and gum. Higher net pricing, net of the adjustment for extreme pricing in Argentina, was driven by input cost-driven pricing actions and reflected across all categories, primarily in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil. 
 
 Segment operating income decreased 31 million (19.9 ), primarily due to higher raw material costs, unfavorable currency-related items, unfavorable volume/mix, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses, costs incurred for the ERP Systems Implementation program and intangible asset impairment charges incurred in 2024. These unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs driven by productivity, lower remeasurement loss on net monetary position and lower acquisition integration costs. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30:

Higher net pricing, net of the adjustment for extreme pricing in Argentina, was driven by input cost-driven pricing actions and reflected across all categories, primarily in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil. Currency-related items were unfavorable, net of the adjustment for extreme pricing in Argentina, due to currency translation rate changes. Unfavorable currency translation impacts were primarily due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the region, primarily the Argentinean peso, Brazilian real and Chilean peso, partially offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the Colombian peso and Mexican peso. Unfavorable volume/mix reflected consumer softness, primarily in Mexico. Overall, unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in chocolate, candy, cheese grocery and gum, partially offset by gains in refreshment beverages and biscuits baked snacks. 
 
 Segment operating income decreased 3 million (0.7 ), primarily due to higher raw material costs, unfavorable currency-related items, unfavorable volume/mix, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, higher costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, costs incurred for the ERP Systems Implementation program and intangible asset impairment charges incurred in 2024. These unfavorable items were mostly offset by higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs driven by productivity and lower remeasurement loss on net monetary position.

Overall, unfavorable volume/mix reflected consumer softness in the U.S in the first half of 2024 though volume trends have improved in the third quarter of the year. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in biscuits baked snacks and candy, partially offset by a gain in chocolate. Unfavorable currency translation rate changes were due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar. Higher net pricing, driven by input cost-driven pricing actions, was reflected across all categories.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We believe that cash from operations, our revolving credit facilities, short-term borrowings and our authorized long-term financing will continue to provide sufficient liquidity for our working capital needs, planned capital expenditures and future payments of our contractual, tax and benefit plan obligations and payments for acquisitions, share repurchases and quarterly dividends. We expect to continue to utilize our commercial paper program and international credit lines as needed. We continually evaluate long-term debt issuances to meet our short- and longer-term funding requirements. We also use intercompany loans with our international subsidiaries to improve financial flexibility. Our investment in JDE Peet's provides us additional flexibility. Overall, we do not expect negative effects to our funding sources that would have a material effect on our liquidity, and we continue to monitor our global operations including the impact of ongoing or new developments in Ukraine and the Middle East. To date, we have been successful in generating cash and raising financing as needed. However, if a serious economic or credit market crisis ensues or other adverse developments arise, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Our most significant ongoing short-term cash requirements relate primarily to funding operations (including expenditures for raw materials, labor, manufacturing and distribution, trade and promotions, advertising and marketing, tax liabilities, benefit plan obligations and lease expenses) as well as periodic expenditures for acquisitions, shareholder returns (such as dividend payments and share repurchases), property, plant and equipment and any significant one-time non-operating items. 
 
 Long-term cash requirements primarily relate to funding long-term debt repayments (refer to Note 8, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements ), our U.S. tax reform transition tax liability and deferred taxes (refer to Note 16, Income Taxes, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023), our long-term benefit plan obligations (refer to Note 10, Benefit Plans, and Note 11 , Benefit Plans, in our Annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023) and commodity-related purchase commitments and derivative contracts (refer to Note 9, Financial Instruments ). 
 
 We generally fund short- and long-term cash requirements with cash from operating activities as well as cash proceeds from short- and long-term debt financing (refer to Debt below). We generally do not use equity to fund our ongoing obligations. 
 
 Cash Flow 
 We believe our ability to generate substantial cash from operating activities and readily access capital markets and secure financing at competitive rates are key strengths and give us significant flexibility to meet our short- and long-term financial commitments. Our cash flow activity is noted below: 
 
 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 2023 
 (in millions) Net cash provided by/(used in): 
 Operating activities 3,451 3,150 Investing activities (1,170) 1,786 Financing activities (2,558) (5,074) 
 
 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 
 The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in cash-basis net earnings, largely due to operating gains, partially offset by unfavorable year-over-year working capital movements, including the payment of the European Commission matter. Refer to Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies for additional information. 
 
 Net Cash (Used in)/Provided by Investing Activities 
 The reduction in net cash used in/provided by investing activities was largely driven by lapping prior year proceeds from the KDP and JDEP share sales (refer to Note 6, Investments combined with higher capital expenditures. We continue to make capital expenditures primarily to modernize manufacturing facilities, implement new product manufacturing and support productivity initiatives. We expect 2024 capital expenditures to be up to 1.5 billion, 
 48 

Table of Contents 

 including capital expenditures in connection with our Simplify to Grow Program and for funding our strategic priorities. We expect to continue to fund these expenditures with cash from operations. 
 
 Net Cash Used in Financing Activities 
 The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to higher debt proceeds combined with lower debt repayments, partially offset by higher share repurchases and higher dividends paid in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same prior year period. 
 
 Dividends 
 We paid dividends of 1,722 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 1,581 million in the first nine months of 2023. The third quarter 2024 dividend of 0.470 per share, declared on July 30, 2024 for shareholders of record as of September 30, 2024, was paid on October 14, 2024. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant to its analysis and decision making. 
 
 We anticipate that the 2024 distributions will be characterized as dividends under U.S. federal income tax rules. The final determination will be made on an IRS Form 1099 DIV issued in early 2025. 
 
 Guarantees 
 As discussed in Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies , we enter into third-party guarantees primarily to cover the long-term obligations of our vendors. As part of these transactions, we guarantee that third parties will make contractual payments or achieve performance measures. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no material third-party guarantees recorded on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. Guarantees do not have, and we do not expect them to have, a material effect on our liquidity. 
 
 Debt 
 The nature and amount of our long-term and short-term debt and the proportionate amount of each varies as a result of current and expected business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As such, we may issue commercial paper or secure other forms of financing throughout the year to meet our short-term working capital or other financing needs. 
 
 At its July 2024 meeting, our Board of Directors approved a new 2 billion long-term financing authorization that replaced the prior long-term financing authorization of 2 billion. As of September 30, 2024, 1.5 billion of the long-term financing authorization remained available. 
 
 Our total debt was 19.8 billion as of September 30, 2024 and 19.4 billion as of December 31, 2023. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 0.42 at September 30, 2024 and 0.41 at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, the weighted-average term of our outstanding long-term debt was 7.9 years. Our average daily commercial paper borrowings outstanding were 1.0 billion in the first nine months of 2024 and 2.7 billion in the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 One of our subsidiaries, Mondelez International Holdings Netherlands B.V. MIHN ), has outstanding debt. The operations held by MIHN generated approximately 72.8 (or 19.5 billion) of the 26.8 billion of consolidated net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The operations held by MIHN represented approximately 82.8 (or 23.1 billion) of the 27.9 billion of net assets as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Refer to Note 8, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements, for additional information on our debt and debt covenants. 

Commodity Trends 
 
 We regularly monitor worldwide supply, commodity cost and currency trends so we can cost-effectively secure ingredients, packaging and fuel required for production. During the first nine months of 2024, the primary drivers of the increase in our aggregate commodity costs were higher cocoa, sugar, nuts, and other ingredient costs, as well as unfavorable year-over-year currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials, partially offset by lower energy, dairy, edible oils, grains and packaging costs. While the costs of our principal raw materials fluctuate, generally we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will broadly remain available.

 A number of external factors such as the current macroeconomic environment, including global inflation, effects of geopolitical uncertainty, climate and weather conditions, commodity, transportation and labor market conditions, exchange rate volatility and the effects of local and global regulations, governmental agricultural or other programs affect the availability and cost of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products. In particular, the supply of cocoa is exposed to many of these factors, including climate change and weather events, local regulations in cocoa-producing countries, and global regulations such as the EU Deforestation Regulation (which requires companies to ensure that the products they place on the EU market or export from it are not associated with deforestation). These factors could impact the supply of cocoa, which could potentially limit our ability to produce our products and significantly impact profitability. 
 
 During the first nine months of 2024, price volatility and the higher aggregate cost environment increased due to international supply chain and labor market disruptions and generally higher commodity, transportation and labor costs. We expect these conditions to continue to impact our aggregate commodity costs. In particular, we expect to face higher cocoa costs in the near- and medium-term due to these factors. For example, the market price for cocoa beans on the Intercontinental Exchange in London was 79 higher on the last trading day of the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same day in the third quarter of 2023 and it is likely that prices will remain elevated for some time. It is possible that we may not be able to increase prices sufficiently to fully cover the incremental costs of cocoa prices in this environment and/or our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in cocoa costs, which could result in a significant impact on our profitability. 
 
 We address higher commodity costs and currency impacts primarily through hedging, higher pricing and manufacturing and overhead cost control. We use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials; however, we may not be able to fully hedge against commodity cost changes, such as dairy, where there is a limited ability to hedge, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. Our commodity procurement practices are intended to mitigate price volatility and provide visibility to future costs, but also may potentially limit our ability to benefit from possible future price decreases. Additionally, our costs for major raw materials will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices. Due to competitive or market conditions, planned trade or promotional incentives, fluctuations in currency exchange rates or other factors, our pricing actions may also lag commodity cost changes temporarily. 

Significant Accounting Estimates 
 
 We prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies and estimates are described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, respectively, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Also refer to Note 1, Basis of Presentation , in this report.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 We use non-GAAP financial information and believe it is useful to investors as it provides additional information to facilitate comparisons of historical operating results, identify trends in our underlying operating results and provide additional insight and transparency on how we evaluate our business. We use non-GAAP financial measures to budget, make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate our performance. We have detailed the non-GAAP adjustments that we make in our non-GAAP definitions below. The adjustments generally fall within the following categories: acquisition and divestiture activities, gains and losses on intangible asset sales and non-cash impairments, major program restructuring activities, constant currency and related adjustments, major program financing and hedging activities and other major items affecting comparability of operating results. We believe the non-GAAP measures should always be considered along with the related U.S. GAAP financial measures. We have provided the reconciliations between the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures along with a discussion of our underlying GAAP results throughout our Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-Q. 
 
 Our primary non-GAAP financial measures are listed below and reflect how we evaluate our current and prior-year operating results. As new events or circumstances arise, these definitions could change. When our definitions change, we provide the updated definitions and present the related non-GAAP historical results on a comparable basis (1) . 
 
 Organic Net Revenue is defined as net revenues (the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure) excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures (2) , short-term distributor agreements related to the sale of business (3) and currency rate fluctuations (4) . We believe that Organic Net Revenue reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business and provides improved comparability of results. We also evaluate Organic Net Revenue growth from emerging markets and developed markets, and these underlying measures are also reconciled to U.S. GAAP above. 
 Our emerging markets include our Latin America region in its entirety; the AMEA region, excluding Australia, New Zealand and Japan; and the following countries from the Europe region: Russia, Ukraine, T rkiye, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, the Baltics and the East Adriatic countries. 
 Our developed markets include the entire North America region, the Europe region excluding the countries included in the emerging markets definition, and Australia, New Zealand and Japan from the AMEA region. 
 
 Adjusted Operating Income is defined as operating income (the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure) excluding the impacts of the Simplify to Grow Program (5) ; gains or losses (including non-cash impairment charges) on goodwill and intangible assets; divestiture (2) or acquisition gains or losses, divestiture-related costs (6) , acquisition-related costs (7) , and acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments (8) ; inventory step-up charges (9) ; the operating results of divestitures (2) ; operating results from short-term distributor agreements related to the sale of a business (3) ; remeasurement of net monetary position (10) ; mark-to-market impacts from commodity, forecasted currency and equity method investment transaction derivative contracts (11) ; impact from resolution of tax matters (12) ; 2017 malware incident net recoveries; incremental costs due to the war in Ukraine (13) ; impact from the European Commission legal matter (14) ; the impact from pension participation changes (15) ; and operating costs from the ERP System Implementation program (16) . We also present Adjusted Operating Income margin, which is subject to the same adjustments as Adjusted Operating Income. We also evaluate growth in our Adjusted Operating Income on a constant currency basis (4) . We believe these measures provide improved comparability of underlying operating results. 
 
 Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted EPS attributable to Mondel z International (the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure) from continuing operations excluding the impacts of the items listed in the Adjusted Operating Income definition as well as losses on debt extinguishment and related expenses; gains or losses on interest rate swaps no longer designated as accounting cash flow hedges due to changed financing and hedging plans; mark-to-market unrealized gains or losses and realized gains or losses from marketable securities (17) ; initial impacts from enacted tax law changes (18) ; and gains or losses on equity method investment transactions including impairments. Similarly, within Adjusted EPS, our equity method 
 52 

Table of Contents 

 investment net earnings exclude our proportionate share of our investee's significant operating and non-operating items (19) . We also evaluate growth in our Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis (4) . We believe Adjusted EPS provides improved comparability of underlying operating results. 
 
 (1) When items no longer impact our current or future presentation of non-GAAP operating results, we remove these items from our non-GAAP definitions. Beginning in Q1 2024, due to a significant devaluation of the Argentinean peso that occurred in December 2023 and the resulting distortion it would cause on our non-GAAP constant currency growth rate measures, we now exclude the impact of pricing in excess of 26 year-over-year ("extreme pricing") in Argentina, which is the level at which hyperinflation generally occurs cumulatively over a 3-year period. We have excluded the impact of extreme pricing in Argentina from our calculation of Organic Net Revenue, Organic Net Revenue growth and other non-GAAP financial constant currency growth measures with a corresponding adjustment to changes in currency exchange rates. We made this change on a prospective basis due to the distorting effect expected in the current period and future periods following the Argentinian peso devaluation that occurred in December 2023 and did not revise our historical non-GAAP constant currency growth measures. Beginning in Q2 2024, we added to the non-GAAP definitions the exclusion of operating expenses associated with the ERP System Implementation program as they represent incremental transformational costs above the normal ongoing level of spending on information technology to support operations (see footnote (16) below). 
 (2) Divestitures include completed sales of businesses, exits of major product lines upon completion of a sale or licensing agreement, the partial or full sale of an equity method investment and changes from equity method investment accounting to accounting for marketable securities. As we record our share of JDE Peet s ongoing earnings on a one-quarter lag basis, any JDE Peet s ownership reductions are reflected as divestitures within our non-GAAP results the following quarter. 
 (3) In the fourth quarter of 2023, we began to exclude the operating results from short-term distributor agreements that have been executed in conjunction with the sale of a business. We exclude this item to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods. 
 (4) Constant currency operating results are calculated by dividing or multiplying, as appropriate, the current-period local currency operating results by the currency exchange rates used to translate the financial statements in the comparable prior-year period to determine what the current-period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prior-year period. Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, we also now include within our currency-related impacts a corresponding adjustment associated with the impact of extreme pricing in Argentina. 
 (5) Non-GAAP adjustments related to the Simplify to Grow Program reflect costs incurred that relate to the objectives of our program to transform our supply chain network and organizational structure. Costs that do not meet the program objectives are not reflected in the non-GAAP adjustments. 
 (6) Divestiture-related costs, which includes costs incurred in relation to the preparation and completion (including one-time costs such as severance related to elimination of stranded costs) of our divestitures as defined in footnote (2), also includes costs incurred associated with our publicly announced processes to sell businesses. We exclude these items to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods. 
 (7) Acquisition-related costs, which includes transaction costs such as third party advisor, investment banking and legal fees, also includes one-time compensation expense related to the buyout of non-vested ESOP shares and realized gains or losses from hedging activities associated with acquisition funds. We exclude these items to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods. 
 (8) Acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments include one-time costs related to the integration of acquisitions as well as any adjustments made to the fair market value of contingent compensation liabilities that have been previously booked for earn-outs related to acquisitions that do not relate to recurring employee compensation expense. We exclude these items to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods. 
 (9) In the third quarter of 2022, we began to exclude the one-time inventory step-up charges associated with acquired companies related to the fair market valuation of the acquired inventory. We exclude this item to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods. 
 (10) In connection with our applying highly inflationary accounting (refer to Note 1, Basis of Presentation for Argentina (beginning in the third quarter of 2018) and T rkiye (beginning in the second quarter of 2022), we exclude the related remeasurement gains or losses related to remeasuring net monetary assets or liabilities denominated in the local currency to the U.S. dollar during the periods presented and the realized gains and losses from derivatives that mitigate the foreign currency volatility related to the remeasurement of the respective net monetary assets or liabilities during the periods presented. 
 (11) We exclude unrealized gains and losses (mark-to-market impacts) from outstanding commodity and forecasted currency and equity method investment transaction derivatives from our non-GAAP earnings measures. The mark-to-market impacts of commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivatives are excluded until such time that the related exposures impact our operating results. Since we purchase commodity and forecasted currency transaction contracts to mitigate price volatility primarily for inventory requirements in future periods, we make this adjustment to remove the volatility of these future inventory purchases on current operating results to facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods. We exclude equity method investment transaction derivative contract settlements as they represent protection of value for future divestitures. 
 (12) See Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies , in this report, and Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies , in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 (13) In February 2022, Russia began a military invasion of Ukraine and we stopped our production and closed our facilities in Ukraine for a period of time due to damage incurred to our facilities during the invasion. We began to incur incremental costs directly related to the war including asset impairments, such as property and inventory losses, higher expected allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable and committed compensation. We have isolated and exclude these costs and related impacts as well as subsequent recoveries from our operating results to facilitate evaluation and comparisons of our ongoing results. Incremental costs related to increasing operations in other primarily European facilities are not included with these costs. 
 (14) In the fourth quarter of 2022, we began to exclude the impact from the European Commission legal matter. In November 2019, the European Commission informed us that it initiated an investigation into our alleged infringement of European Union competition law through certain practices allegedly restricting cross-border trade within the European Economic Area. On January 28, 2021, the European Commission announced it had taken the next procedural step in its investigation and opened formal proceedings. As of December 31. 2022, we recorded an estimate of the possible cost to resolve this matter. We have cooperated with the investigation and have reached a negotiated resolution to this matter. We subsequently adjusted our accrual accordingly and fulfilled our payment obligation in August 2024. Due to the unique nature of this matter, we believe it to be infrequent and 
 53 

Table of Contents 

 unusual and therefore exclude it to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods. Refer to Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies, for additional information. 
 (15) The impact from pension participation changes represents the charges incurred when employee groups are withdrawn from multiemployer pension plans and other changes in employee group pension plan participation. We exclude these charges from our non-GAAP results because those amounts do not reflect our ongoing pension obligations. See Note 10, Benefit Plans , for additional information on the multiemployer pension plan withdrawal. 
 (16) In July 2024, our Board of Directors approved funding of 1.2 billion for a multi-year systems transformation program to upgrade our global ERP and supply chain systems (the ERP System Implementation ), which is comprised of both capital expenditures and operating expenses, of which a majority is expected to be operating expenses. The ERP System Implementation program will be implemented in several phases with spending occurring over the next five years, with expected completion by year-end 2028. The operating expenses associated with the ERP System Implementation represent incremental transformational costs above the normal ongoing level of spending on information technology to support operations. These expenses include third-party consulting fees, direct labor costs associated with the program, accelerated depreciation of our existing SAP financial systems and various other expenses, all associated with the implementation of our information technology upgrades. These operating expenses will be excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures as they are nonrecurring and excluding those costs will better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods. 
 (17) In the first quarter of 2023, we began to exclude mark-to-market unrealized gains or losses, as well as realized gains or losses, associated with our marketable securities from our non-GAAP earnings measures. These marketable securities gains or losses are not indicative of underlying operations and are excluded to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods. 
 (18) We have excluded the initial impacts from enacted tax law changes. Initial impacts include items such as the remeasurement of deferred tax balances and the transition tax from the 2017 U.S. tax reform. We exclude initial impacts from enacted tax law changes from our Adjusted EPS as they do not reflect our ongoing tax obligations under the enacted tax law changes. 
 (19) We have excluded our proportionate share of our equity method investees significant operating and non-operating items such as acquisition and divestiture-related costs, restructuring program costs and initial impacts from enacted tax law changes, in order to provide investors with a comparable view of our performance across periods. Although we have shareholder rights and board representation commensurate with our ownership interests in our equity method investees and review the underlying operating results and significant operating and non-operating items each reporting period, we do not have direct control over their operations or resulting revenue and expenses. Our use of equity method investment net earnings on an adjusted basis is not intended to imply that we have any such control. Our GAAP diluted EPS attributable to Mondel z International from continuing operations includes all of the investees significant operating and non-operating items. 
 
 We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with our U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures, provides a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures. Because non-GAAP financial measures vary among companies, the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this report may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Our use of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any U.S. GAAP financial measures. A limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is they exclude items that have an impact on our U.S. GAAP reported results. The best way this limitation can be addressed is by evaluating our non-GAAP financial measures in combination with our U.S. GAAP reported results and carefully evaluating the tables that reconcile U.S. GAAP reported figures to the non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-Q, which can be found above under Consolidated Results of Operations .

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 
 
 As we operate globally, we are primarily exposed to currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest rate market risks. We monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. 
 
 We principally utilize derivative instruments to reduce significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. Additionally, we periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt based on current and projected market conditions. For additional information on our derivative activity and the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge our currency exchange, commodity price and interest rate exposures, see Note 9, Financial Instruments and for additional information on our debt activity, see Note 8, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements . 
 
 For additional information on our strategies, policies and practices on an ongoing basis, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We have established disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management, together with our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 Management, together with our CEO and CFO, evaluated the changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. There were no material changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
