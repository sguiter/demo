 million, representing a effective tax rate, for the 28 weeks ended September 7, 2024. The Company's effective tax rate for the 28 weeks ended September 7, 2024 differs from the federal income tax statutory rate of 21 primarily due to state income taxes, partially offset by federal tax credits and the reduction of a reserve for an uncertain tax position due to the expiration of a state statute.

The Company's effective tax rate for the 28 weeks ended September 9, 2023 differs from the federal income tax statutory rate of 21 primarily due to the reduction of a reserve of million for an uncertain tax position due to the expiration of a foreign statute during the first quarter of fiscal 2023, as well as discrete benefits recognized for state income taxes.

 per share in cash, without interest. The per share consideration to be paid by Parent would be reduced by the special cash dividend of per share of Class A common stock (the "Special Dividend"), which was declared on October 13, 2022 and paid on January 20, 2023. 
 
 At the Effective Time, each outstanding equity award denominated in shares of Class A common stock will be converted into a corresponding award with respect to shares of Parent common stock (the "Converted Awards"). The Converted Awards will remain outstanding and subject to the same terms and conditions (including vesting and

 less the Special Dividend, divided by (ii) the average closing price of shares of Parent common stock for five trading days preceding the Closing. 
 
 In connection with obtaining the requisite regulatory clearance necessary to consummate the Merger, the Company and Parent expect to make divestitures of stores owned by the Company and Parent to a third party. As described in the Merger Agreement and subject to the outcome of the divestiture process and negotiations with applicable government authorities, the Company was prepared to establish a Company subsidiary ("SpinCo") as part of this process. If utilized, the common stock or interests in SpinCo would be distributed to Company stockholders no later than the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") and SpinCo would operate as a standalone public company, or the equity of SpinCo would be contributed to a trust for later distribution to Company stockholders. As described in more detail below, on September 8, 2023, the Company and Kroger announced that they entered into a comprehensive divestiture plan with C S Wholesale Grocers, LLC ("C S"). As a result of the comprehensive divestiture plan announced with C S, Kroger has exercised its right under the Merger Agreement to sell what would have been the SpinCo business to C S. Consequently, the creation of SpinCo and spin-off previously contemplated by the Company and Kroger is no longer a requirement under the Merger Agreement and will no longer be pursued by the Company and Kroger. 
 
 On September 8, 2023, the Company and Kroger announced that the parties had entered into a definitive agreement, dated September 8, 2023, with C S for the sale of select stores, banners, distribution centers, offices and private label brands to C S. On April 22, 2024, the Company and Kroger announced they had amended the definitive agreement with C S. The amended package modifies and builds on the initial divestiture package (collectively, the "Divestiture Assets"). The Divestiture Assets will be divested by Kroger following the Closing. The definitive agreement has customary representations and warranties and covenants of a transaction of its type. The divestiture to C S is subject to fulfillment of customary closing conditions, including clearance by the United States Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") and the completion of the proposed Merger. 
 
 In accordance with the Merger Agreement, the Company has extended the original outside date of January 13, 2024 to October 9, 2024 (the "Outside Date"). The Parent will be obligated to pay a termination fee of million to the Company if the Merger Agreement is terminated by either party in connection with the occurrence of the Outside Date, and, at the time of such termination, all closing conditions other than regulatory approval have been satisfied. As of the time of filing this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, neither the Company nor Parent has provided a notice of termination with respect to the Merger Agreement. 
 
 On February 26, 2024, the FTC instituted an administrative proceeding to prohibit the Merger. On the same day, the FTC (joined by nine states) filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon, requesting a preliminary injunction to enjoin the Merger (the "Federal Action"). On January 15, 2024 and February 14, 2024, the attorneys general of States of Washington and Colorado, respectively, filed suit in their respective state courts, also seeking to enjoin the Merger. In the Federal Action, the Company and Parent have stipulated to a temporary restraining order that prevents the Merger from closing until 11:59 PM Eastern Time on the fifth business day after the court rules on the FTC's motion for a preliminary injunction or until after the date set by the court, whichever is later. The FTC administrative proceeding and the preliminary injunction hearing in the Federal Action have concluded and the Company awaits a decision. A trial on the State of Washington's request for a permanent injunction has concluded and the Company awaits a decision. In conjunction with the State of Washington's suit, the Company and Parent have committed that they will not close the Merger until five days after that court rules (so

 The Company records cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable at cost. The recorded values of these financial instruments approximate fair value based on their short-term nature. 
 
 The estimated fair value of the Company's debt, including current maturities, was based on Level 2 inputs, being market quotes or values for similar instruments, and interest rates currently available to the Company for the issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities as a discount rate for the remaining principal payments. As of September 7, 2024, the fair value of total debt was million compared to the carrying value of million, excluding debt discounts and deferred financing costs. As of February 24, 2024, the fair value of total debt was million compared to the carrying value of million, excluding debt discounts and deferred financing costs. 
 Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis 
 
 The Company measures certain assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis, including long-lived assets and goodwill, which are evaluated for impairment. Long-lived assets include store-related assets such as property and equipment, operating lease assets and certain intangible assets. The inputs used to determine the fair value of long-lived assets and a reporting unit are considered Level 3 measurements due to their subjective nature. 
 
 During the 12 weeks ended September 7, 2024, the Company recorded impairment losses of million, primarily related to equipment from the closing of our micro-fulfillment centers and million of retail store impairment losses. The impairment losses are included as a component of Loss (gain) on property dispositions and impairment losses, net.

 qui tam actions alleging violations of the False Claims Act ("FCA") have been filed against the Company and its subsidiaries. Violations of the FCA are subject to treble damages and penalties of up to a specified dollar amount per false claim. 
 
 In United States ex rel. Proctor v. Safeway , filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois, the relator alleges that Safeway overcharged federal government healthcare programs by not providing the federal government, as part of its usual and customary prices, the benefit of discounts given to customers in pharmacy membership discount and price-matching programs. The relator filed his complaint under seal on November 11, 2011, and the complaint was unsealed on August 26, 2015. The relator amended the complaint on March 31, 2016. On June 12, 2020, the District Court granted Safeway's motion for summary judgment, holding that the relator could not prove that Safeway acted with the intent required under the FCA, and judgment was issued on June 15, 2020. On July 10, 2020, the relator filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment and to supplement the record, which Safeway opposed. On November 13, 2020, the District Court denied relator's motion, and on December 11, 2020, relator filed a notice of appeal. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment in the Company's favor on April 5, 2022. On August 3, 2022, relators filed a petition seeking review by the U.S. Supreme Court. 
 
 In United States ex rel. Schutte and Yarberry v. SuperValu, New Albertson's, Inc., et al. , also filed in the Central District of Illinois, the relators allege that defendants (including various subsidiaries of the Company) overcharged federal government healthcare programs by not providing the federal government, as a part of usual and customary prices, the benefit of discounts given to customers who requested that defendants match competitor prices. The complaint was originally filed under seal and amended on November 30, 2015. On August 5, 2019, the District Court granted relators' motion for partial summary judgment, holding that price-matched prices are the usual and customary prices for those drugs. On July 1, 2020, the District Court granted the defendants' motions for summary judgment and dismissed the case, holding that the relator could not prove that defendants acted with the intent required under the FCA. Judgment was issued on July 2, 2020. On July 9, 2020, the relators filed a notice of appeal. On August 12, 2021, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the grant of summary judgment in the Company's favor. On September 23, 2021, the relators filed a petition for rehearing en banc with the Seventh Circuit. On December 3, 2021, the Seventh Circuit denied relators' petition. On April 1, 2022, relators filed a petition seeking review by the U.S. Supreme Court.

 cases for the purpose of hearing the appeal. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments on April 18, 2023. On June 1, 2023, the Supreme Court issued an opinion adverse to the Company that reversed the lower court's rulings. On July 3, 2023, the Supreme Court issued the order remanding both cases back to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit for further review. On July 27, 2023, the Court of Appeals remanded both cases back to the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois. On August 22, 2023, the District Court - as to Schutte - set a pretrial conference for March 4, 2024, and a trial date of April 29, 2024. At the same July 27 hearing, the District Court also gave the defendants leave to file motions for summary judgment on a schedule to be agreed upon. On October 11, 2023, the Company and co-defendant filed a motion for summary judgment. On the same day, the relators filed motions for partial summary judgment. Both sides' motions are pending. On February 16, 2024, the Company and co-defendant filed a motion to reconsider a prior grant of partial summary judgment against the defendants, and also a motion to continue the trial. On February 27, 2024, the District Court granted the motion to continue and vacated the April 29, 2024 trial date. At a pretrial conference on March 4, 2024, the District Court reset the trial for September 30, 2024. On May 20, 2024, the District Court heard oral argument on the pending motions. On May 22, 2024, the Company and co-defendant filed a motion to continue the trial to January 2025, but in any event no earlier than November 2024. On August 5, 2024, the District Court granted the motion to continue the trial. On September 16, 2024, the District Court set trial to begin on February 3, 2025. The District Court has not set any trial date for Proctor as of yet, and no motions are pending in that case. 
 
 In both of the above cases, the federal government previously investigated the relators' allegations and declined to intervene. The relators elected to pursue their respective cases on their own and in each case have alleged FCA damages in excess of million before trebling and excluding penalties. The Company is vigorously defending each of these matters. The Company has recorded an estimated liability for these matters. 
 
 Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) Litigation: The Company (including its subsidiary, Safeway Inc.) is a defendant in a lawsuit filed on January 21, 2021, in Minnesota state court, captioned Health Care Service Corp. et al. v. Albertsons Companies, LLC, et al. The action challenges certain prescription-drug prices reported by the Company to a pharmacy benefit manager, Prime Therapeutics LLC ("Prime"), which in turn contracted with the health-insurer plaintiffs to adjudicate and process prescription-drug reimbursement claims. 
 
 On December 7, 2021, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. On January 14, 2022, the court denied the Company's motion to dismiss as to all but one count, plaintiffs' claim of negligent misrepresentation. On January 21, 2022, the Company and co-defendant SUPERVALU, Inc. ("SUPERVALU") filed a third-party complaint against Prime, asserting various claims, including: indemnification, fraud and unjust enrichment. On February 17, 2022, the Company filed in the Minnesota Court of Appeals an interlocutory appeal of the denial of their motion to dismiss on personal jurisdiction grounds (the "Jurisdictional Appeal"). On February 24, 2022, the Company and SUPERVALU filed in the trial court an unopposed motion to stay proceedings, pending the resolution of the Jurisdictional Appeal. The parties agreed on March 6, 2022, to an interim stay in the trial court pending a ruling on the unopposed motion to stay proceedings. On September 6, 2022, the Minnesota Court of Appeals denied the Jurisdictional Appeal and affirmed the trial court s denial of the Company s motion to dismiss. On October 6, 2022, the Company and SUPERVALU filed a petition seeking review by the Minnesota Supreme Court. On November 23, 2022, the Minnesota Supreme Court denied that petition. The Company and co-defendant SUPERVALU filed an answer to the complaint on January 23, 2023. On March 9, 2023, Prime moved to dismiss the third-party complaint filed by the Company and SUPERVALU. The court heard oral arguments on the motion on May 11, 2023. On August 9, 2023, the court denied Prime's motion as to 16 of the counts in the third-party complaint, and dismissed one count without prejudice. On September 18, 2023, the Company and SUPERVALU filed an amended third-party complaint, which repleaded the one count that had been dismissed (in addition to the other claims asserted in the initial third-party complaint). On October 2, 2023, Prime filed an answer to the amended third-party complaint. The parties are presently engaged in discovery. The case is currently scheduled to be ready for trial on or after September 29, 2025.

 suits pending in various state and federal courts including the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, where over cases against various defendants have been consolidated as Multi-District Litigation ("MDL") pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1407. All of the MDL cases naming the Company have been stayed except for so called "bellwether" actions in Tarrant County (Texas), Town of Hull (Massachusetts) and Monterey County (California). In the Tarrant County bellwether, the Company's motion for summary judgment is pending before the Court. Discover in the remaining bellwethers will begin shortly. The relief sought by the various plaintiffs in these matters includes compensatory damages, abatement and punitive damages as well as injunctive relief. On July 30, 2024, multiple plaintiffs filed an Omnibus Motion for Leave to Amend several of their complaints, seeking leave from the MDL court to add the Company to over of additional lawsuits. The Company's response to the Omnibus Motion is due December 6, 2024. 
 
 Prior to the start of a state-court trial that was scheduled for September 6, 2022, the Company reached an agreement to settle with the State of New Mexico. The New Mexico counties and municipal entities that filed additional lawsuits, including Santa Fe County, agreed to the terms of the settlement. Thus, all cases filed by New Mexico entities have been dismissed as a result of the settlement. The Company executed an agreement to settle matters pending in Nevada state court. The Company recorded a liability of million for the settlements of the cases in New Mexico and Nevada which was paid by our insurers in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. With respect to the remaining pending state court claims, claims are currently proceeding through discovery, with trial dates scheduled in 2025. Those matters are pending in Dallas County (Texas), the State of Washington and the City of Philadelphia (Pennsylvania). The Company believes that it has substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and is vigorously defending these matters. At this stage in the proceedings, the Company is unable to determine the probability of the outcome of these remaining matters or the range of reasonably possible loss. 
 
 The Company has also received, subpoenas, Civil Investigative Demands and other requests for documents and information from the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") and certain state Attorneys General, and has had preliminary discussions with the DOJ with respect to purported violations of the federal Controlled Substances Act and the FCA in dispensing prescriptions. The Company has been cooperating with the government with respect to these requests for information.

As of June 17, 2023, of the originally issued Convertible Preferred Stock had been converted into Class A common stock and shares of Convertible Preferred Stock are outstanding. In applying the two-class method to interim periods, the Company allocates income to its quarterly periods independently and discretely from its year-to-date and annual periods. Basic net income per Class A common share is computed by dividing net income allocated to Class A common stockholders by the weighted average number of Class A common shares outstanding for the period, including Class A common shares to be issued with no prior remaining contingencies prior to issuance. Diluted net income per Class A common share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding during each period, plus potential Class A common shares considered outstanding during the period, as long as the inclusion of such awards is not antidilutive. Potential Class A common shares consist of unvested restricted stock units ("RSUs"), restricted common stock ("RSAs") and Convertible

 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND FACTORS THAT IMPACT OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND TRENDS 
 
 This Form 10-Q contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The "forward-looking statements" include our current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections about our business, our industry and the outcome of the Merger. They include statements relating to our future operating or financial performance which the Company believes to be reasonable at this time. You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of words such as "outlook," "may," "should," "could," "estimates," "predicts," "potential," "continue," "anticipates," "believes," "plans," "expects," "future" and "intends" and similar expressions which are intended to identify forward-looking statements. 
 
 These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties which are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by the statements. Risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements include: 
 
 uncertainties related to our ability to close the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including resolution of the pending legal actions related to the Merger; 
 erosion of consumer confidence in our business as a result of the Merger; 
 restrictions on our ability to operate as a result of the Merger Agreement and the impact of the costs related to the Merger; 
 challenges in retaining and motivating our associates until the closing of the Merger, particularly following the public announcement of the locations and operations to be divested, with difficulties in attracting new employees during the pendency of the Merger; 
 litigation in connection with, or related to the transactions contemplated by, the Merger Agreement which may arise out of pending regulatory actions; 
 changes in macroeconomic conditions such as rates of food price inflation or deflation, fuel and commodity prices and expiration of student loan payment deferments; 
 changes in consumer behavior and spending due to the impact of macroeconomic factors; 
 failure to achieve productivity initiatives, unexpected changes in our objectives and plans, inability to implement our strategies, plans, programs and initiatives, or enter into strategic transactions, investments or partnerships in the future on terms acceptable to us, or at all; 
 changes in wage rates, ability to attract and retain qualified associates and negotiate acceptable contracts with labor unions; 
 availability and cost of goods used in our food products; 
 challenges with our supply chain; 
 operational and financial effects resulting from cyber incidents at the Company or at a third party, including outages in the cloud environment and the effectiveness of business continuity plans during a ransomware or other cyber incident; and 
 changes in tax rates, tax laws, and regulations that directly impact our business or our customers may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements and risk factors. Forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q

Table of Contents 

reflect our view only as of the date of this Form 10-Q. We undertake no obligation, other than as required by law, to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 
 
 In evaluating our financial results and forward-looking statements, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties more fully described in the "Risk Factors" section or other sections in our reports filed with the SEC including the most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.

 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 
 We define EBITDA as GAAP earnings (net loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings (net loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to eliminate the effects of items management does not consider in assessing our ongoing core performance. We define Adjusted net income as GAAP Net income adjusted to eliminate the effects of items management does not consider in assessing our ongoing core performance. We define Adjusted net income per Class A common share as Adjusted net income divided by the weighted average diluted Class A common shares outstanding, as adjusted to reflect all RSUs and RSAs outstanding at the end of the period, as well as the conversion of Convertible Preferred Stock when it is antidilutive for GAAP. See "Results of Operations" for further discussion and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income and Adjusted net income per Class A common share. 
 
 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income and Adjusted net income per Class A common share (collectively, the "Non-GAAP Measures") are performance measures that provide supplemental information we believe is useful to analysts and investors to evaluate our ongoing results of operations, when considered alongside other GAAP measures such as net income, operating income, gross margin and net income per Class A common share. These Non-GAAP Measures exclude the financial impact of items management does not consider in assessing our ongoing core operating performance, and thereby provide useful measures to analysts and investors of our operating performance on a period-to-period basis. Other companies may have different definitions of Non-GAAP Measures and provide for different adjustments, and comparability to our results of operations may be impacted by such differences. We also use Adjusted EBITDA for board of director and bank compliance reporting. Our presentation of Non-GAAP Measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. 
 
 Non-GAAP Measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using Non-GAAP Measures only for supplemental purposes.

 Net sales and other revenue increased 1.4 to 18,551.5 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 from 18,290.7 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase in Net sales and other revenue was driven by our 2.5 increase in identical sales, with strong growth in pharmacy sales driving the identical sales increase. We also continued to grow our digital sales during the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase in Net sales and other revenue was partially offset by lower fuel sales.

 Identical Sales, Excluding Fuel 
 
 Identical sales include stores operating during the same period in both the current year and the prior year, comparing sales on a daily basis. Direct to consumer digital sales are included in identical sales, and fuel sales are excluded from identical sales. Acquired stores become identical on the one-year anniversary date of the acquisition. Identical sales for the 12 and 28 weeks ended September 7, 2024 and the 12 and 28 weeks ended September 9, 2023, respectively, were:

 Gross Margin 
 
 Gross margin represents the portion of Net sales and other revenue remaining after deducting Cost of sales during the period, including purchase and distribution costs. These costs include, among other things, purchasing and sourcing costs, inbound freight costs, product quality testing costs, warehouse and distribution costs, Own Brands program costs and digital-related delivery and handling costs. Advertising, promotional expenses and vendor allowances are also components of Cost of sales. 
 
 Gross margin rate was unchanged at 27.6 during both the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Excluding the impact of fuel and LIFO expense, gross margin rate decreased 44 basis points compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The strong growth in pharmacy sales, which carries an overall lower gross margin rate, and increases in picking and delivery costs related to the continued growth in our digital sales were the 
 26

primary drivers of the decrease, partially offset by the benefits from our procurement and sourcing productivity initiatives. 
 
 Gross margin rate increased to 27.7 during the first 28 weeks of fiscal 2024 compared to 27.6 during the first 28 weeks of fiscal 2023. Excluding the impact of fuel and LIFO expense, gross margin rate decreased 31 basis points compared to the first 28 weeks of fiscal 2023. The strong growth in pharmacy sales, which carries an overall lower gross margin rate, increases in shrink during the first quarter of fiscal 2024, and increases in picking and delivery costs related to the continued growth in our digital sales were the primary drivers of the decrease, partially offset by the benefits from our procurement and sourcing productivity initiatives. 
 
 Selling and Administrative Expenses 
 
 Selling and administrative expenses consist primarily of store level costs, including wages, employee benefits, rent, depreciation and utilities, in addition to certain back-office expenses related to our corporate and division offices. 
 
 Selling and administrative expenses increased to 25.8 of Net sales and other revenue during the second quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 25.1 during the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Excluding the impact of fuel, Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales and other revenue increased 41 basis points. The increase in Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales and other revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in operating expenses related to the ongoing development of our digital and omnichannel capabilities, Merger-related costs, higher employee costs, increased business transformation costs and additional third-party store security services, partially offset by the benefits from our productivity initiatives. 
 
 Selling and administrative expenses increased to 25.8 of Net sales and other revenue during the first 28 weeks of fiscal 2024 compared to 25.1 of Net sales and other revenue for the first 28 weeks of fiscal 2023.

 Loss (Gain) on Property Dispositions and Impairment Losses, Net 
 
 For the second quarter of fiscal 2024, net loss on property dispositions and impairment losses was 43.9 million, primarily driven by 53.3 million of asset impairments including impairment losses of 39.8 million primarily related to equipment from the closing of our micro-fulfillment centers and 13.5 million of retail store impairment losses, partially offset by 9.4 million of gains from the sale of real estate assets.

 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 1,374.1 million for the first 28 weeks of fiscal 2024 compared to 1,347.9 million for the first 28 weeks of fiscal 2023. The change in cash flow from operations compared to the first 28 weeks of fiscal 2023 was due to changes in working capital, primarily related to lower inventory, a decrease in multiemployer pension withdrawal liability payments and less cash paid for taxes and interest, partially offset by a decrease in Adjusted EBITDA, higher Merger-related costs and an increase in contributions to our defined benefit pension plans during the first 28 weeks of fiscal 2024. 
 
 Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 925.3 million for th e first 28 weeks of fiscal 2024 co mpared to 890.1 million for the first 28 weeks of fiscal 2023. 
 
 For the first 28 weeks of fiscal 2024, cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of payments for property, equipment and intangibles of 952.3 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets of 19.8 million, primarily related to real estate. Payments for property, equipment and intangibles in the first 28 weeks of fiscal 2024 included the completion of 44 remodels, the opening of two new stores and continued investment in our digital and technology platforms. For the first 28 weeks of fiscal 2023, cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of payments for property, equipment and intangibles of 1,084.3 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets of 195.1 million, primarily related to the sale of our equity interest in El Rancho during the first quarter of

fiscal 2023. Payments for property, equipment and intangibles in the first 28 weeks of fiscal 2023 included the completion of 80 remodels, the opening of three new stores and continued investment in our digital and technology platforms. 
 
 Net Cash Used in Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 357.8 million during the first 28 weeks of fiscal 2024 compared to net cash used in financing activities of 651.1 million during the first 28 weeks of fiscal 2023 . 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities during the first 28 weeks of fiscal 2024 consisted primarily of the 200.0 million repayment of the ABL Facility, dividends paid on our Class A common stock and tax withholding payments on vesting of RSUs, partially offset by 50.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt under the ABL Facility. Net cash used in financing activities during the first 28 weeks of fiscal 2023 consisted primarily of the 500.0 million partial repayment of the ABL Facility, dividends paid on our Class A common stock and tax withholding payments on vesting of RSUs, partially offset by 50.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt under the ABL Facility. 
 
 Dividends 
 
 We have established a dividend policy pursuant to which we intend to pay a quarterly dividend on our Class A common stock. Cash dividends paid on our Class A common stock were 139.0 million 0.24 per common share) and 138.0 million 0.24 per common share) during the first 28 weeks of fiscal 2024 and first 28 weeks of fiscal 2023, respectively. On October 15, 2024, we announced the next quarterly dividend payment of 0.12 per share of Class A common stock to be paid on November 8, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on October 28, 2024. 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 Based on current operating trends, we believe that we have significant sources of cash to meet our liquidity needs for the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future, including cash on hand, cash flows from operating activities and other sources of liquidity, including the ABL Facility. We estimate our liquidity needs over the next 12 months to be approximately 5.1 billion, which includes anticipated requirements for working capital, Merger costs, capital expenditures, pension obligations, interest payments, quarterly dividends on Class A common stock, operating leases and finance leases. In addition, we may enter into refinancing and sale leaseback transactions from time to time. We believe we have adequate cash flow to continue to maintain our current debt ratings and to respond effectively to competitive conditions. 
 
 As of September 7, 2024, we had 50.0 million borrowings outstanding under our ABL Facility and total availability of 3,908.3 million (net of letter of credit usage). 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
 The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position, and we apply those accounting policies in a fair and consistent manner. See the Critical Accounting Policies section included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 24, 2024, filed with the SEC on April 22, 2024, for a discussion of our significant accounting policies.

 See Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our unaudited interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements located elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. 

Item 3 - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 There have been no material changes in our exposure to market risk from the information provided in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 24, 2024, filed with the SEC on April 22, 2024. 

Item 4 - Controls and Procedures 
 
 Based on their evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act")) as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1 - Legal Proceedings 
 
 The Company is subject from time to time to various claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business, including lawsuits involving trade practices, lawsuits alleging violations of state and/or federal wage and hour laws (including alleged violations of meal and rest period laws and alleged misclassification issues), real estate disputes and other matters. Some of these claims or suits purport or may be determined to be class actions and/or seek substantial damages. It is the opinion of the Company's management that although the amount of liability with respect to certain of the matters described in this Form 10-Q cannot be ascertained at this time, any resulting liability of these and other matters, including any punitive damages, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's business or overall financial condition. See the matters under the caption Legal Proceedings in Note 6 - Commitments and Contingencies and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements in the unaudited interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements located elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. 
 
 The Company continually evaluates its exposure to loss contingencies arising from pending or threatened litigation and believes it has made provisions where the loss contingency is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Nonetheless, assessing and predicting the outcomes of these matters involves substantial uncertainties. While management currently believes that the aggregate estimated liabilities currently recorded are reasonable, it remains possible that differences in actual outcomes or changes in management's evaluation or predictions could arise that could be material to the Company's results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 Environmental Matters 
 
 Our operations are subject to regulation under environmental laws, including those relating to waste management, air emissions and underground storage tanks. In addition, as an owner and operator of commercial real estate, we may be subject to liability under applicable environmental laws for clean-up of contamination at our facilities. SEC regulations require us to disclose certain environmental matters arising under federal, state or local environmental provisions if we reasonably believe that such proceedings may result in monetary sanctions above a stated threshold. Pursuant to SEC regulations, we use a threshold of 1 million for purposes of determining whether disclosure of any such proceedings is required. 
 
 Item 1A - Risk Factors 
 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors previously included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 24, 2024, filed with the SEC on April 22, 2024, under the heading "Risk Factors."
