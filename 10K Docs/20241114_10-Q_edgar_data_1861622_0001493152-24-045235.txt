rates, (iii) the operation of a proprietary booking platform (the App ), which functions as a prospecting and quoting platform

which took effect on November 12, 2024. On the effective date, every 
shares of common stock issued and outstanding were combined into one issued share of common stock. In addition, the aggregate number
of equity-based awards that remain available to be granted under the Company s equity compensation plans was decreased

exercise of outstanding stock options, as applicable, as well as to the number of shares that would be owned upon vesting and
settlement of restricted stock units and other equity-based awards, as applicable. Similar proportionate adjustments were also made
to the outstanding warrants. Stockholders otherwise entitled to receive fractional shares of common stock as a result of the reverse
stock split received cash (without interest or deduction) in lieu of such fractional share interests. In accordance with ASC 260-10-55-12, the Company has adjusted the number of shares,
per-share computations and the computations of basic and diluted EPS retroactively for all periods presented in the consolidated

of internal software related costs, which is included
in intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The software officially launched on December 31, 2020. Amortization
expense for nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was and , which is included in cost of revenues in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations. Accumulated amortization as of September 30, 2024 was . 

Under
the fractional ownership program, a customer purchases an ownership share in a jet which guarantees the customer access to the jet for
a preset number of hours per year. The fractional ownership program consists of a down payment,
one or more progress payments, a payment on delivery, a Monthly Management Fee (MMF) and an Occupied Hourly Fee (OHF). Revenues
from the sale of fractional or whole interests in an aircraft are recognized at the time title to the aircraft is transferred to the
purchasers, which generally occurs upon delivery or ownership transfer. 

The
jet card program provides the customer with a preset number of hours of guaranteed private jet access over the agreement term (generally
a year) without the larger hourly or capital commitment of purchasing an ownership share. The jet card program consists of a fixed hourly
rate for flight hours typically paid 100 up front. 

Revenue
is recognized upon transfer of control of the Company s promised services, which generally occurs upon the flight hours being used.
Any unused hours for the fractional jet and jet card programs are forfeited at the end of the contract term and are thus immediately
recognized as revenue at that time. 

Deferred
revenue is an obligation to transfer services to a customer for which the Company has already received consideration. Upon receipt of
a prepayment from a customer for all or a portion of the transaction price, the Company initially recognizes a contract liability. The
contract liability is settled, and revenue is recognized when the Company satisfies its performance obligation to the customer at a future
date. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company deferred and , respectively, related to prepaid
flight hours under the jet card program for which the related travel had not yet occurred. 

The
Company also generates revenues from individual ad hoc charter bookings processed through the Company s App, whereby the Company
sources, negotiates, and arranges travel on a charter basis for a customer based on pre-selected options and pricing provided by the
Company to the customer through the App. In addition, Cirrus Aviation markets charters on the Company s aircraft for the Company s
benefit. Deferred revenue with respect to the App was and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

The
Company utilizes certificated independent third-party air carriers in the performance of a portion of flights. The Company evaluates
whether there is a promise to transfer services to the customer, as the principal, or to arrange for services to be provided by another
party, as the agent, using a control model. The nature of the flight services the Company provides to members is similar regardless of
which third-party air carrier is involved. The Company directs third-party air carriers to provide an aircraft to a member or customer.
Based on evaluation of the control model, it was determined that the Company acts as the principal rather than the agent within all revenue
arrangements. Owner charter revenue is recognized for flights where the owner of a managed aircraft sets the price for the trip. The
Company records owner charter revenue at the time of flight on a net basis for the margin we receive to operate the aircraft. If the
Company has primary responsibility to fulfill the obligation, then the revenue and the associated costs are reported on a gross basis
in the consolidated statements of operations. Deferred revenue with respect to the management of aircraft was and as of September
30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

Jet Card and Fractional Programs 

Management and Other Services 

Total revenues 

Flights 

Flights
and flight-related services, along with the related costs of the flights, are earned and recognized as revenue at the point in time in
which the service is provided. For round-trip flights, revenue is recognized upon arrival at the destination for each flight segment. 

Fractional
and jet card members pay a fixed quoted amount for flights based on a contractual capped hourly rate. Ad hoc charter customers primarily
pay a fixed rate for flights. In addition, flight costs are paid by members through the purchase of dollar-denominated prepaid blocks
of flight hours Prepaid Blocks ), and other incidental costs such as catering and ground transportation are billed monthly
as incurred. Prepaid Blocks are deferred and recognized as revenue when the member completes a flight segment. 

Aircraft
Management 

The
Company manages aircraft for owners in exchange for a contractual fee. Revenue associated with the management of aircraft also includes
the recovery of owner-incurred expenses including maintenance coordination, cabin crew and pilots, as well as recharging of certain incurred
aircraft operating costs and expenses such as maintenance, fuel, landing fees, parking and other related operating costs. The Company
passes the recovery and recharge costs back to owners at either cost or a predetermined margin. 

Aircraft
management-related revenue contains two types of performance obligations. One performance obligation is to provide management services
over the contract period. Revenue earned from management services is recognized over the contractual term, on a monthly basis. The second
performance obligation is the cost to operate and maintain the aircraft, which is recognized as revenue at the point in time such services
are completed. 

Aircraft
Sales 

The
Company acquires aircraft from vendors and various other third-party sellers in the private aviation industry. The Company classifies
the purchase as aircraft inventory on the consolidated balance sheets. Aircraft inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable
value. Sales are recorded on a gross basis within revenues and cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company
recorded aircraft sales of 0 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Pass-Through
Costs 

In
applying the guidance of ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an
amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue
recognition for arrangements that the Company determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following five steps:
(i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction
price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the
entity satisfies a performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company
will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception,
once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, the Company assesses the goods or services promised within each contract
and determines those that are distinct performance obligations. The Company then assesses whether it is acting as an agent or a principal
for each identified performance obligation and includes revenue within the transaction price for third-party costs when the Company determines
that it is acting as the principal. 

Cost
of Sales 

The
cost of sales expenses includes costs incurred in providing air transportation services, such as chartering third-party aircraft, aircraft
lease expenses, pilot training and wages, aircraft fuel, aircraft maintenance, and other aircraft operating expenses, each of which is
discussed below. 

1. 
 Chartering
 Third-Party Aircraft: The cost of chartering third-party aircraft is recorded as a part of the cost of sales expense. These expenses
 include the fees paid to third-party operators for providing aircraft services on behalf of the company. Expenses are recognized
 in the income statement in the period when the service is rendered and are reported on an accrual basis. 

2. 
 Aircraft
 Lease Expenses: Aircraft lease expenses include the cost of leasing aircraft for the company s operations. The lease expenses
 are recognized as an operating expense in the income statement over the lease term on a straight-line basis. 

3. 
 Pilot
 Training and Wages: Pilot training costs are expensed as incurred and are included in the cost of sales expenses. This encompasses

Combination, while Jet.AI is referred to as the Counterparty after the consummation of the Business Combination. Capitalized
terms used in this description but not otherwise defined have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Forward Purchase Agreement. 

Pursuant
to the terms of the Forward Purchase Agreement, Seller intended, but was not obligated, to purchase up to (the Purchased
Amount Class A ordinary shares, par value per share, of Oxbridge Oxbridge Shares concurrently with the
closing pursuant to the Seller s FPA Funding Amount PIPE Subscription Agreement (as defined below), less the number of Oxbridge
Shares purchased by the Seller separately from third parties through a broker in the open market Recycled Shares ). The

Shortfall provided that Seller was to pay one-half (1/2) of the Prepayment Shortfall to Counterparty on the Prepayment Date
(which amount was netted from the Prepayment Amount) (the Initial Shortfall and, at the request of Counterparty, the other

to pay the Company an amount equal to the Number of Shares subject to the Forward Purchase Agreement (provided such Shares
are registered for resale or freely transferrable pursuant to an exemption from registration) multiplied by a per share price reflecting
the Company s volume weighted average trading price over a number of days following the Valuation Date, subject to alternate calculations

Three
Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Revenues 

Revenues
for the third quarter of 2024 totaled 3.9 million, a 0.5 million increase from 2023 s third quarter revenues of 3.4 million,
and were comprised of 977,000 in services revenue from the management of customers aircraft, 2.4 of revenues related to our
software App Cirrus Charter program (being 1.1 million in software-related revenue and 1.3 million in revenue from the chartering of
our HondaJets by our operating partner Cirrus), 547,000 in Jet Card revenue for hours flown and other charges based on hours flown,
and 1.3 million in revenue from the chartering of our HondaJets by our operating partner Cirrus. 

The
primary reason for this increase in revenue was due to additional service revenue of 977,000 in the 2024 period arising from the Company
entering into an agreement to manage a second customer aircraft in the second quarter of 2024 and the resulting revenue thereafter. 

The
following table sets forth a breakout of revenue components by subcategory for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

The
Company recognized 1.1 million in revenue related to App-generated Services and software revenues related to charter bookings made through
its App in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 300,000 and reflected additional brokerage staff, increased marketing and greater
awareness of the Company. This compares to revenues totaling 798,000 in the 2023 period. 

The
Company recognized 960,000 in service revenue in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 186,000, relating to an agreement entered
into during the fourth quarter of 2023 to manage a customer s aircraft, as well as a second managed aircraft beginning in April
2024. There was 775,000 in service revenues in the third quarter of 2023. 

During
the third quarter of 2024, the Company sold 110 prepaid flight hours under its jet card and fractional programs, amounting to 615,000,
and recognized 547,000 of revenue for 85 flight hours flown or forfeited, as well as additional charges. These additional charges represent
primarily charges for cost reimbursements such as a fuel component adjustment to adjust for changes in fuel prices relative to the jet
card and fractional contracts base fuel price and reimbursement of federal excise taxes. Prepaid flight hours are recognized as
revenue as the flight hours are used or forfeited. At September 30, 2024, the Company had recorded deferred revenue of 1.2 million on
its consolidated balance sheet representing prepaid flight hours for which the related travel had not yet occurred. 

In
the third quarter of 2023, the Company sold 122 prepaid flight hours, amounting to 713,000, and recognized 709,000 of revenue for 113
flight hours flown or forfeited, as well as additional charges. At September 30, 2023, the Company had recorded deferred revenue of approximately
 1.2 million. 

The
increase in flight hours flown period over period is a direct result of the increased number of the Company s aircraft during the
2024 period when compared to the 2023 period. 

The
following table details the flight hours sold and flown or forfeited, as well as the associated deferred revenues and recognized revenues,
respectively, and additional charges for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023:

 1,206,869 
 1,163,237 

(1) 
 Deferred
 revenue at June 30, 2024 and 2023 also includes 56,067 and 10,301, respectively, with respect to customer prepayments associated
 with software app transactions and 16,233 and 0 with respect to customer prepayments associated with management and other services
 revenue. 

(2) 
 Deferred
 revenue at September 30, 2024 and 2023 also includes 29,269 and 268,889, respectively, with respect to customer prepayments associated
 with software app transactions and 16,233 and 0 with respect to customer prepayments associated with management and other services
 revenue. 

In
addition to its software App and jet card revenues, the Company also generates revenue through the direct chartering of its HondaJet
aircraft by Cirrus. During the third quarter of 2024 this revenue amounted to approximately 1.1 million, an increase of 249,000, or
23.4 from the prior year period. The increased revenue was a direct result of the increased chartering of the Company s HondaJet
and CJ4 fleet, as well as increased software app bookings in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023. 

Cost
of revenues 

Our
cost of revenue is comprised of payments to Cirrus for the maintenance and management of our fleet aircraft, commissions to Cirrus for
their arranging for charters on our aircraft, aircraft lease expense, federal excise tax relating to jet card and third-party charters,
and payments to third-party aircraft operators for both charter flights booked through our App, as well as the cost of subcharters for
covering jet card flights when our HondaJets were unavailable. The management of our aircraft by Cirrus covers all our aircraft regardless
of whether the aircraft are used for program flight hours or charter flights and includes expenses such as fuel, pilot wages and training
costs, aircraft insurance, maintenance and other flight operational expenses. 

In
the third quarter of 2024, the Company operated three HondaJets, one King Air 390 and one CJ4 as compared to the three HondaJets and
one CJ4 that it operated in the comparable 2023 period. 

As
a result of the increase in Cirrus charter flight activity, costs related to the operation of these aircraft and payments to Cirrus for
their management increased 1.2 million from 1.4 million in the third quarter of 2023 to 2.6 million in 2024, and aircraft lease payments
increased remained the same at 317,000 in the third quarter of 2023 and 2024. The Company also incurred third-party charter costs of
approximately 0.9 million in the third quarter of 2024, a 0.5 million decrease over 2023, in order to fulfill a greater number of App-generated
charter bookings, offset by a reduction in subcharters used for covering jet card flights when our HondaJets were unavailable. Merchant
fees and federal excise tax relating to charter flights of 130,000 in the third quarter of 2024 were a 89,000 increase as compared
to 41,000 in the third quarter of 2023. 

In
total, it cost 3.9 million to operate these five aircraft in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 3.2 million to operate four aircraft
in the third quarter of 2023. 

Gross
(loss) profit 

The
resulting gross loss totaled approximately 14,000 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to a gross profit of 170,000 for the third
quarter of 2023. The gross loss in the third quarter of 2024 was largely driven by reduced flights performed for our jet card customers
without a corresponding reduction in fixed costs. 

Total
Operating Expenses 

In
the third quarter of 2024, the Company s operating expenses decreased by approximately 1.6 million over the prior year comparable
period due to an approximate 1.5 million decrease in general and administrative expenses, a 74,000 reduction in sales and marketing
expenses and an 11,000 reduction in research and development costs. Excluding non-cash stock-based compensation of 1.3 million and
 2.7 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively, general and administrative expenses declined by approximately 129,000
primarily due to a decrease in professional service expenses of 297,000 with a substantial portion of these expenses during the 2023
period related to the closing of the Business Combination in the third quarter of 2023, offset by an increase in Directors and Officers
Insurance costs of 40,000 and increased wages of 170,000, primarily due to increased commissions compensation payable on software app
revenue. 

The
Company s sales and marketing expenses decreased by 74,000 to 83,000 in the third quarter of 2024 from 157,000 in the third
quarter of 2023. These expenses are mainly linked to promoting the Company and its programs. 

27 

Research
and development expenses declined 11,000 to 38,000 in the third quarter of 2024 from 49,000 in the third quarter of 2023, due to the
reduced need to refine the App, offset by continued development work on additional software offerings. 

Operating
Loss 

As
a result of all of the above, in the third quarter of 2024 the Company recognized an operating loss of approximately 2.9 million, which
was a decrease in loss of approximately 1.4 million when compared to the prior year period. The decrease in operating loss was primarily
due to the decrease in general and administrative expenses resulting from the decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation expense that
resulted from the non-cash vesting of employee stock options as well as the decrease in professional costs incurred from the Business
Combination. 

Other
(Income) Expense 

During
the third quarter of 2024, the Company recognized approximately 56 in other income as compared to 24,000 in other expense due primarily
to interest expense related to the Bridge Agreement as defined and discussed below. 

Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Revenues 

Revenues
for the first nine months of 2024 totaled 10.9 million, a 2.9 million increase from revenues of 8.0 during the comparable period in
2023. Revenues in the 2024 period were comprised of approximately 6.4 of revenues related to our software App and Cirrus charter services
(comprised of approximately 3.4 million in software-related revenue and 2.9 million in revenue from the chartering of our HondaJets
by our operating partner Cirrus), 2.7 million in services revenue from the management of customers aircraft, and 1.8 million
in Jet Card revenue for hours flown and other charges based on hours flown.

The
Company began recording revenue in September 2020 reflecting services and software revenues related to charter bookings made through
its App and in the first nine months of 2023, the Company recognized 2.2 million in revenue related to App-generated charter bookings.
During 2024 these revenues totaled 3.4 million, a 1.2 million or 59.2 increase from 2023 reflecting additional brokerage staff, increased
marketing and greater awareness of the Company. 

The
Company recognized 2.7 million in service revenue in the first nine months of 2024, an increase of 1.2 million, relating to an agreement
entered into during the fourth quarter of 2023 to manage a customer s aircraft, as well as a second managed aircraft beginning
in April 2024. There was 1.5 million in service revenues in the first nine months of 2023. 

During
the first nine months of 2024, the Company sold 220 prepaid flight hours under its jet card and fractional programs, amounting to 1.3
million, and recognized 1.8 of revenue for 267 flight hours flown or forfeited, as well as additional charges. These additional charges
represent primarily charges for cost reimbursements such as a fuel component adjustment to adjust for changes in fuel prices relative
to the jet card and fractional contracts base fuel price and reimbursement of federal excise taxes. Prepaid flight hours are recognized
as revenue as the flight hours are used or forfeited. At September 30, 2024, the Company recorded deferred revenue of 1.2 million on
its consolidated balance sheet, which represents prepaid flight hours for which the related travel had not yet occurred. 

28 

In
the first nine months of 2023, we sold 383 prepaid flight hours amounting to approximately 2.1 million and recognized approximately
 2.1 million of revenue for 323 flight hours flown or forfeited, as well as additional charges. At September 30, 2023, the Company recorded
deferred revenue of 1.2 million on its consolidated balance sheet. 

The
increase in flight hours flown is a direct result of the increased number of aircraft during the 2024 period versus the 2023 period.

During
the first nine months of 2024 revenue generated through the direct chartering of the Company s HondaJet aircraft by Cirrus amounted
to approximately 2.9 million, an increase of 0.7 million, or 31.0 from the prior year. The increased revenue was a direct result of
increased charter activity, both ad hoc and by Cirrus, as well as the addition of the managed Citation CJ4 and King Air 350i. 

Cost
of revenues 

Our
cost of revenue is comprised of payments to Cirrus for the maintenance and management of our fleet aircraft, commissions to Cirrus for
their arranging for charters on our aircraft, aircraft lease expense, federal excise tax relating to jet card and third-party charters,
and payments to third-party aircraft operators for both charter flights booked through our App, as well as the cost of subcharters for
covering jet card flights when our HondaJets were unavailable. The management of our aircraft by Cirrus covers all our aircraft regardless
of whether the aircraft are used for program flight hours or charters and includes expenses such as fuel, pilot wages and training costs,
aircraft insurance, maintenance and other flight operational expenses. 

29 

As
a result of the increased fleet and the increase in jet card and Cirrus charter flight activity, as well as the startup expenses relating
to the introduction of the King Air 350i managed aircraft to its fleet, operating expenses related to the operation of the Company s
aircraft and payments to Cirrus for their management increased 3.6 million from 3.3 million in the first nine months of 2023 to 6.9
million in the 2024 year period and aircraft lease payments increased 43,000 from 967,000 in 2023 to 1.0 million in the first nine
months of 2024. The Company also incurred third-party charter costs of approximately 3.0 million in the first nine months of 2024, a
 559,000 decrease over 2023, as a result of a reduced need for subcharters used for covering jet card flights when our HondaJets were
unavailable. Federal excise tax and merchant fees relating to charter flights increased 242,000 in the first nine months of 2024 to
 541,000 from 299,000 in 2023. 

In
total, excluding aircraft sales costs and as disclosed above, it cost 11.4 million to operate the Company s 5 aircraft in the
first nine months of 2024, compared to 8.1 million in 2023 for 4 aircraft. 

Gross
(loss) profit 

The
resulting gross loss totaled 555,000 for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 105,000 for the 2023 year period. The increased
gross loss in these operations was a result of increased maintenance costs, together with lower utilization on our HondaJets. 

Total
Operating Expenses 

In
the first nine months of 2024, the Company s operating expenses decreased 632,000 due to a 878,000 decrease in general and administrative
expenses and 6,000 in lower research and development costs, offset by 252,000 in higher sales and marketing expenses. Excluding non-cash
stock-based compensation of 3.7 million and 5.4 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively, general and administrative
expenses rose by approximately 0.8 million primarily due to due to increased wages of 632,000, primarily due to increased commissions
compensation payable on charter sales, as well as a greater number of software developers in 2024. 

The
Company s sales and marketing expenses increased by about 252,000 to 632,000 in the first nine months of 2024 from 380,000 in
2023, as it reaccelerated its sales and marketing spending upon aircraft delivery and the associated increase in marketable jet card
inventory. These expenses are mainly linked to promoting the Company and its programs. 

Research
and development expenses declined 6,000 to 108,000 in the first nine months of 2024 from 114,000 in 2023, due to the reduced need
to refine the App, offset by continued development work on additional software offerings. 

Operating
Loss 

As
a result of all of the above, in the first nine months of 2024 the Company recognized an operating loss of approximately 9.3 million,
which was a decrease in loss of 182,000 compared to the 2023 year period. The decrease was primarily due to reduced general and administrative
expenses of 878,000, offset by an increase in the Company s gross loss of 549,000. 

Other
(Income) Expense 

During
the first nine months of 2024, the Company recognized approximately 79,000 in other expense due primarily to interest expense related
to the Bridge Agreement, compared to 24,000 recorded for the first nine months of 2023. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Overview 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company s cash and equivalents were 311,883. As of September 30, 2024, current liabilities exceeded
current assets by approximately 4.8 million, of which 1.2 million in liabilities represents deferred revenue that would be recorded
as revenue once the flight hours are flown or forfeited. 

During
the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company raised (1) approximately 1,727,000 in funds from the issuance of 14,222
shares of common stock under the Share Purchase Agreement discussed below, as well as 1,500,000 related to the sale of 150 shares of
Series B Preferred Stock, and (2) approximately 742,000 from Jet.AI Warrant exercises. 

30 

The
Company also incurred negative cash flows from operating activities and significant losses from operations in the past as reflected in
its accumulated deficit of approximately 49.1 million as of September 30, 2024. While we expect to drive revenue and operating profit
growth from aircraft acquisitions, higher average hourly pricing of jet cards, increased charter activity through CharterGPT and Reroute
AI and SaaS revenues from DynoFlight, we expect to continue to incur operating losses to a greater or lesser extent for at least the
next 12 months, depending on the timing and success of these initiatives. To bridge the gap, we intend to rely on funds available from
share issuances under the Share Purchase Agreement, amounts received upon an exercise of the Ionic Warrant (as defined below), if any,
and other potential sales of our equity and debt securities to meet our funding obligations. Additional funding under the Share Purchase
Agreement may be limited contractually and the Ionic Warrant may not be exercised by the holder in full or substantial part. Furthermore,
issuances of additional shares of common stock under the Share Purchase Agreement, upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock outstanding
and underlying the Ionic Warrant and other sales of equity securities we have made after September 30, 2024 may negatively impact the
Company s stock price and ability to raise additional funds. We will likely require additional capital resources to grow our business.
In the absence of external financing the Company is prepared to cut its cash utilization by ceasing marketing and customer acquisition,
suspending software development, streamlining operations, and servicing only existing customers. Such a reduction would allow the Company
to continue to operate for a year or more by management s estimate. During that time the Company would plan to arrange new financing
and to then resume expansion. 

Ionic
Transaction 

General 

On
March 28, 2024, Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the Securities Purchase Agreement and a number of
other transaction documents described below for a private placement with Ionic Ventures, LLC Ionic ), which closed on March
29, 2024 (the Closing Date ), which we collectively refer to as the Ionic Transaction. Under the Securities
Purchase Agreement, the Company issued to Ionic (a) 150 shares of the Company s Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, par value
 0.0001 per share (the Series B Preferred Stock ), which are convertible into shares of the Company s common stock,
(b) a warrant to purchase up to 1,500 shares of Series B Preferred Stock (the Ionic Warrant ), at an exercise price of 10,000
per share, and (c) 1,111 shares of the Company s common stock. 

The
Company received gross proceeds of approximately 1.5 million, not including customary placement fees and reimbursement of certain payables
to Maxim as placement agent and other expenses payable by the Company in connection with the Ionic Transaction. This amount excludes
the proceeds, if any, from the exercise of the Ionic Warrant. 

Series
B Preferred Stock 

On
March 28, 2024, we filed a Certificate of Designation of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware, which provides for the issuance of up to 5,000 shares of the Company s Series B Preferred Stock. The Series
B Preferred Stock ranks pari passu with the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series A-1 Preferred Stock and senior to all
other capital stock of the Company. 

Each
share of Series B Preferred Stock converts into a number of shares of our Common Stock, subject to certain limitations, including a beneficial
ownership limitation of 4.99 (calculated in accordance with the rules promulgated under Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act),
which can be adjusted to a beneficial ownership limitation of 9.99 upon 61 days prior written notice by Ionic. From time to time Ionic
may convert Series B Preferred Stock into Common Stock which it may liquidate and thereafter receive additional shares of Common Stock
pursuant to subsequent conversions of its Series B Preferred Stock. 

31 

Subject
to the limitations set forth in the preceding paragraph and provided there is an effective registration statement covering Ionic s
potential resale of common stock underlying the Series B Preferred Stock, shares of Series B Preferred Stock will automatically convert
into shares of common stock on or prior to the tenth trading day after the issuance date of such shares of Series B Preferred Stock.
The number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of a share of Series B Preferred Stock is calculated by dividing the conversion
amount per share of Series B Preferred Stock by the then conversion price. The conversion amount is equal to the stated value of the
shares of Series B Preferred Stock, which is 10,000, plus any additional amounts and late charges calculated in accordance with the
Certificate of Designations. The conversion price is equal to 90 (or, in the case of a delisting, 80 of the lowest daily volume weighted
average price of our common stock over a period beginning on the trading day after we deliver shares of common stock upon such conversion
to Ionic and ending on the trading day on which the aggregate dollar trading volume of our common stock exceeds seven times the applicable
conversion amount, subject to a five trading day minimum period for such calculation, and subject to certain adjustments. 

If
certain defined triggering events defined in the Certificate of Designations occur, such as a breach of the Ionic Registration
Rights Agreement, suspension of trading, or our failure to convert the Series B Preferred Stock into common stock when a conversion right
is exercised, then we may be required to redeem the Series B Preferred Stock for cash at 110 of the stated value. 

Other
Transaction Documents 

The
Ionic Warrant exercise price was initially set at 10,000 per share of Series B Preferred Stock, subject to adjustment for certain events,
such as a stock split, issuance of additional shares as a dividend or otherwise. If the entirety of the Ionic Warrant was exercised for
cash, the Company would receive additional gross proceeds of approximately 15.0 million. The Company cannot predict when or if there
will be additional exercises of the Ionic Warrant. It is possible that the Ionic Warrant may never be exercised in full, or in substantial
part. At any time when the Ionic Warrant is exercisable for less than 1,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock, the Company has the right
to redeem all or a portion of the Ionic Warrant by paying to Ionic in cash 100 per share of Series B Preferred Stock that would otherwise
be issuable pursuant to the Ionic Warrant. 

Pursuant
to the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to submit to its stockholders a proposal to approve the issuance of shares of
common stock issuable upon exercise of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock in accordance with Nasdaq Stock Market Rules at a special
meeting of stockholders at the earliest practicable date after the date of the Securities Purchase Agreement, but in no event later than
ninety (90) days after the Closing Date. At its annual meeting of stockholders, which took place on September 24, 2024, the Company sought
stockholder approval for the potential issuance of shares of Common Stock pursuant to Ionic Transaction in an amount that, upon issuance,
could result in the issuance of shares of Common Stock in an amount in excess of 19.99 of the Company s outstanding shares of
Common Stock at a price less than the minimum price as defined by and in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d). The
Company s stockholders approved such potential issuance at the annual meeting. The Securities Purchase Agreement obligates the
Company to reserve no less than 200 of the maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B Preferred
Stock outstanding, using an alternate conversion method (the Required Reserve Amount ). The Company and Ionic initially
agreed that the Required Reserve Amount is 200,000 shares of Common Stock. In order to meet that obligation, the Company sought stockholder
approval to amend its certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Common Stock to 200,000,000 at its
annual meeting of stockholders. The Company received such approval on September 24, 2024. 

Additionally,
on March 29, 2024, the Company entered into the Registration Rights Agreement Ionic, which, among other things, provides that the Company
would register the resale of the 1,111 shares of Common Stock and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B
Preferred Stock, including the Series B Preferred Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrant. The Company was required to prepare and
file a registration statement with the SEC no later than 30 days following the filing of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the Form 10-K ), but in no event later than May 15, 2024 (the Filing Deadline ),
and to use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the registration statement and any amendment declared effective no later than
the earlier of the (a) 60th calendar day following the filing of the Form 10-K (or, if such registration statement is subject to a full
review by the SEC, the 100th calendar day after such filing) and (b) 2nd business day after the date the Company is notified (orally
or in writing, whichever is earlier) by the SEC that such registration statement will not be reviewed or will not be subject to further
review (the Effectiveness Deadline ). The Company timely filed a registration statement on Form S-1 by the Filing Deadline,
however, because this registration statement was not declared effective by the SEC by the Effectiveness Deadline, the Company was obligated
pay to Ionic a 100,000 Effectiveness Fee. On September 3, 2024 the Company issued to Ionic 444 Effectiveness Shares in lieu of paying
the Effectiveness Fee in cash. The registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on October 23, 2024. 

32 

On
September 24, 2024, the Company and Ionic entered into a letter agreement (the Letter Agreement that set forth certain
understandings and agreements among the Company and Ionic. Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, Ionic agreed to refrain from taking action
to protect its legal rights under the transaction documents, related to certain actions and transactions identified in the Letter Agreement
that the Company has undertaken or effected prior to the date of the Letter Agreement. As consideration for the waiver, the Company agreed
to a release of Ionic and its affiliates and issued an additional 50 shares of Series B Preferred Stock to Ionic. 

On
October 10, 2024, the Company and Ionic entered into a second letter agreement (the Second Letter Agreement that set forth
certain understandings and agreements among the Company and Ionic. Pursuant to the Second Letter Agreement, Ionic agreed to refrain from
taking action to protect its legal rights under the transaction documents, related to certain actions and transactions identified in
the Second Letter Agreement. Such actions include the Company s filing of an amendment to a registration statement on Form S-1
(File No. 333-281911) with the SEC and a registered direct offering. As consideration for the waiver, the Company agreed to change the
Conversion Measurement Period (as defined in the Certificate of Designations) for the previously issued 200 shares of Series B Preferred
Stock to begin on March 28, 2024 and to end in accordance with the Certificate of Designations. 

Share
Purchase Agreement 

The
Company has access to an aggregate of up to 40 million from the Share Purchase Agreement, dated as of August 4, 2022, with GEM Yield
LLC SCS and GEM Yield Bahamas Limited (together with GEM Yield LLC SCS, GEM ), less drawdowns of 2,550,024 to date. In
consideration for GEM s services under the Share Purchase Agreement, the Company has agreed to pay GEM a commitment fee equal to
 800,000 payable in cash or freely tradable shares of common stock, at the option of the Company. Upon the Company s issuance of
shares in connection with any drawdown purchase made by GEM, the Company is required to pay GEM a portion of such commitment fee in an
amount equal to 2 of the amount purchased in such drawdown; provided that the full 800,000 commitment fee was due on or before the
first anniversary of the closing of the Business Combination. In October 2024, the Company issued 36,886 shares of common stock to satisfy
in full the outstanding commitment fee payable discussed in Note 5 and 44,225 shares of common stock under the Share Purchase Agreement
with GEM for total consideration of 822,745. 

GEM
is not obligated to purchase shares under the Share Purchase Agreement if any purchase of shares would result in GEM and its affiliates
beneficially owning, directly or indirectly, at the time of the proposed issuance, more than 9.99 of the number of issued and outstanding
shares of common stock as of the date of such proposed issuance. GEM may waive the restriction under the Share Purchase Agreement by
providing the Company with sixty-one (61) days notice that the Purchaser would like to waive the restriction with regard to any
or all shares issuable pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement. 

On
August 10, 2023, the Company issued GEM a warrant (as subsequently amended, the GEM Warrant granting it the right to purchase
up to 6 of the outstanding common stock of the Company on a fully diluted basis as of the date of listing. The GEM Warrant has a term
of three years. The exercise price of the GEM Warrant was reduced to .24 per share as of September 30, 2024. The warrant may be exercised
by payment of the per share amount in cash or through a cashless exercise. 

The
GEM Warrant provides that GEM can elect to limit the exercisability of the GEM Warrant such that it is not exercisable to the extent
that, after giving effect to the exercise, GEM and its affiliates, to the Company s actual knowledge, would beneficially own in
excess of 4.99 of Jet.AI s common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise. GEM has made this election,
which makes funds available under the Share Purchase Agreement in excess of this 4.99 ownership limit up to the 9.99 ownership restriction
in the Share Purchase Agreement. GEM may revoke this election by providing written notice, which revocation will not be effective until
the sixty-first (61st) day thereafter. 

33 

Bridge
Agreement 

On
September 11, 2023, the Company entered into a binding term sheet Bridge Agreement with eight investors to provide the
Company 500,000 of short-term bridge financing pending its receipt of funds from its other existing financing arrangements. 

As
of December 31, 2023, the Bridge Agreement provided for the issuance of Notes, in an aggregate principal amount of 625,000, reflecting
a 20 original issue discount. The Notes bore interest at 5 per annum and matured on March 11, 2024. The Company was required to redeem
the Notes with 100 of the proceeds of any equity or debt financing at a redemption premium of 110 of the principal amount of the Notes.
In March 2024, the Company fully repaid the Bridge Agreement in the amount of approximately 683,000, representing principal, redemption
premium and interest. 

Other
Equity Issuances and Settlement Arrangements 

Maxim
Payment and Settlement Agreement 

On
August 10, 2023, the Company entered into a settlement agreement Maxim Settlement Agreement with Maxim Group LLC, the
underwriter for the Company s initial public offering Maxim ). Pursuant to the Maxim Settlement Agreement, the Company
issued to Maxim Partners (a) 1,200 shares of common stock to settle the payment obligations of the Company under the underwriting agreement
dated on or about August 11, 2021, by and between the Company and Maxim and (b) 1,127 Series A Preferred Shares in an amount equal in
value to 1,127,000. The Series A Preferred Shares accrue a dividend at the rate of 8 per annum (which increases to 18 if the Company
fails to meet certain obligations under the terms thereof), payable quarterly and, at the Company s option, in shares of common
stock. The Series A Preferred Shares are convertible into 501 shares of common stock. The Company also issued 511 shares of common stock
to Maxim Partners on August 16, 2021 to meet a payment obligation under the underwriting agreement in connection with Oxbridge s
IPO, representing a value of 2,025.00 per share reflecting an allocation of the 2,250.00 per Unit IPO price. The above issued and issuable
shares of common stock are subject to a registration rights agreement. 

The
Company may, subject to certain conditions, redeem the outstanding Series A Preferred Shares in cash at the 1,000 original issue price,
subject to adjustment, plus accrued and unpaid dividends. The Company was required to redeem all the outstanding Series A Preferred Shares
on August 10, 2024, which was automatically extended by an additional three (3) month period because the Company has not closed upon
one or more equity financings that, in total, result in gross proceeds to the Company of 10.0 million or greater. If the Company raises
equity capital, 15 of the net proceeds will be used to redeem the Series A Preferred Shares if requested by the holder. 

In
July 2024, the Company and Maxim entered into an amendment to the Maxim Settlement Agreement and agreed to, among other things, amend
the definition of the Series A Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred Shares and
certain restrictions with respect to shares of Company common stock Maxim may acquire upon the conversion of its shares of Series A Preferred
Shares. 

Sponsor
Settlement Agreement 

On
August 10, 2023, the Company entered into settlement agreement Sponsor Settlement Agreement with the Sponsor. Pursuant
to the Sponsor Settlement Agreement, the Company issued 575 Series A-1 Preferred Shares to settle the payment obligations of the Company
under a promissory note in the principal amount of 575,000 dated November 14, 2022 in favor of the Sponsor. The Series A-1 Preferred
Shares accrue interest at the rate of 5 per annum (which increases to 18 if the Company fails to meet certain obligations under the
terms thereof), payable quarterly in cash. The Series A-1 Preferred Shares are convertible into 256 shares of common stock. 

The
Company may, subject to certain conditions, redeem the outstanding Series A-1 Preferred Shares in cash at the 1,000 original issue price,
subject to adjustment, plus accrued and unpaid dividends. The Company was required to redeem all the outstanding Series A-1 Preferred
Shares on August 10, 2024, which was automatically extended by an additional three (3) month period because the Company has not closed
upon one or more equity financings that, in total, result in gross proceeds to the Company of 10.0 million or greater. If the Company
raises equity capital, 15 of the net proceeds will be used to redeem the Series A-1 Preferred Shares if requested by the holder. 

34 

Warrants 

On
various dates at the end of December 2023 and through early 2024, we entered a number of separate warrant exchange agreements with various
unaffiliated second-party warrant holders with respect to warrants to purchase an aggregate of 6,605 shares of our common stock (the
 Exchanged Warrants ). Pursuant to these warrant exchange agreements, the Company issued an aggregate of 6,605 shares of
common stock to those warrant holders in exchange for the surrender and cancellation of the Exchanged Warrants. 

In
December 2023 and January 2024, holders of an aggregate of 687 JTAIW warrants were exercised for an equal number of shares of our common
stock, generating net proceeds to us of 1,777,475. 

Cash
Flows for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company s cash and equivalents were approximately 312,000. 

The
following table summarizes our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

Cash
Flow from Operating Activities 

Net
cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 4.8 million compared to 2.7 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. The cash outflow from operating activities in the 2024 period primarily consisted of our net loss, net
of non-cash charges of 4.2 million, a 0.4 million reduction in lease liability, which were offset by a 1.2 million increase in operating
liabilities and a 41,000 reduction in accounts receivables and other current assets. The increase in operating liabilities was primarily
driven by a 1.2 million increase in the Company s accounts payable and accrued liabilities relating to the operation of the Company s
aircraft and a 0.6 million decrease in deferred jet card revenue relating to the sale of jet card hours not yet flown. The increase
in net cash used in operating activities for the 2024 period was primarily driven by a 1.6 million increase in our net loss, net of
non-cash charges resulting from the Company s higher level of operations during the first nine months of 2024 as a result of operating
a greater number of operational aircraft and startup expenses incurred during 2024 as well as the 0.5 million changes in operating assets
and liabilities. 

Cash
Flow from Investing Activities 

Net
cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 13,000 as compared to 170,000 in the 2023 year period,
primarily relating to the Company s 2023 investment in 380 Software LLC, a 50/50 joint venture subsidiary with Great Western Air
LLC dba Cirrus Aviation Services. 

Cash
Flow from Financing Activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.1 million. Cash provided by financing activities
was primarily driven by warrant exercises and proceeds from the sale of common stock under the Share Purchase Agreement, sale of preferred
stock, partially offset repayments of notes payable.

Aircraft
Financing Arrangements 

In
November 2021 and April 2022, the Company entered into two separate five-year leasing arrangements for the acquisition of two of its
HondaJet Elite aircraft. At any time during their term, the Company has the option to purchase either aircraft from the lessor at the
aircraft s fair market value at that time. The leasing arrangements also require the Company to hold a combined liquidity reserve
of 500,000 in a separate bank account pledged as security to the lessor, which the Company records as restricted cash on its balance
sheet, as well as a maintenance reserve of approximately 690,000 for each leased aircraft, which is held by the lessor in the event
the lessor determines that the relevant aircraft is not being maintained in accordance with the lease requirements or to prevent deterioration
of the aircraft. Events of default under the leasing arrangements include, among other things, failure to make the monthly payments (with
a 10-day cure period), default on other indebtedness, breaches of covenants related to insurance and maintenance requirements, change
of control or merger, insolvency and a material adverse change in the Company s business, operations or financial condition. Please
see Note 5 to the Company s consolidated financial statements for a further description of these leasing arrangements. 

Subsequent
to September 30, 2024 on October 31, 2024, the Company entered into and aircraft purchase agreement for the purchase of 3 Cessna Citation
CJ4 aircraft (the CJ4 Aircraft ). Under the aircraft purchase agreement, the Company may purchase from Textron specifically
configured CJ4 Aircraft. Upon execution of the purchase agreement an initial deposit was paid for
each aircraft, and three additional deposits are due on each aircraft and payable on defined intervals starting in November 2024 through
August 2025. Upon delivery of the aircraft the remainder of the purchase price will become due and payable. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

Going
Concern and Management Plans 

The
Company has limited operating history and has incurred losses from operations since its inception. These matters raise concern about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

The
Company began ramping up its revenue-generating activities during the second half of the year ended December 31, 2022 and those activities
have continued into 2024. During the next twelve months, the Company intends to fund its operations with funds from its operations, and
drawdowns under the Share Purchase Agreement, as well as proceeds from other financing arrangements. The Company also has the ability
to reduce cash burn to preserve capital. There are no assurances, however, that management will be able to raise capital on terms acceptable
to the Company. If the Company is unable to obtain sufficient amounts of additional capital, the Company may be required to reduce the
near-term scope of its planned development and operations, which could delay implementation of the Company s business plan and
harm its business, financial condition and operating results. The consolidated balance sheets do not include any adjustments that might
result from these uncertainties. 

Basis
of Presentation for the Business Combination 

The
Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with GAAP, whereby Oxbridge is treated as the acquired
company and Jet Token is treated as the acquirer (the Reverse Recapitalization ). Accordingly, for accounting purposes,
the Reverse Recapitalization was treated as the equivalent of Jet Token issuing stock for the net assets of Oxbridge, accompanied by
a recapitalization. The net assets of Oxbridge were stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. 

Jet
Token has been determined to be the accounting acquirer in the Business Combination based on the following predominate factors: 

Jet
 Token s existing stockholders have the greatest voting interest in the combined entity; 

Jet
 Token existing stockholders have the ability to nominate a majority of the initial members of the combined entity board; 

Jet
 Token s senior management is the senior management of the combined entity; 

Jet
 Token is the larger entity based on historical operating activity and has the larger employee base; and 

The
 post-combination company has assumed a Jet Token branded name: Jet.AI Inc. 

36 

Use
of Estimates 

The
preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statement and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Making estimates requires management to exercise significant
judgement. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that
existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term
due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. 

Material
estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near-term relate to the fair value of options granted. Although
considerable variability is likely to be inherent in these estimates, management believes that the amounts provided are reasonable. These
estimates are 

Revenue
Recognition 

In
applying the guidance of ASC 606, the Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps: 

Identification
 of the contract, or contracts, with a customer; 

Identification
 of the performance obligations in the contract; 

Determination
 of the transaction price; 

Allocation
 of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and 

Recognition
 of revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied. 

Revenue
is derived from a variety of sources including, but not limited to, (i) fractional/whole aircraft sales, (ii) fractional ownership and
jet card programs, (iii) ad hoc charter through the Jet Token App (replaced by CharterGPT) and (iv) aircraft management. 

Under
the fractional ownership program, a customer purchases an ownership share in a jet which guarantees the customer access to the jet for
a preset number of hours per year. The fractional ownership program consists of a down payment, one or more progress payments, a payment
on delivery, a monthly management fee and an occupied hourly fee based on usage. Revenues from the sale of fractional or whole interests
in an aircraft are recognized at the time title to the aircraft is transferred to the purchasers, which generally occurs upon delivery
or ownership transfer. 

The
jet card program provides the customer with a preset number of hours of guaranteed private jet access over the agreement term (generally
a year) without the larger hourly or capital commitment of purchasing an ownership share. The jet card program consists of a fixed hourly
rate for flight hours typically paid 100 up front. 

Revenue
is recognized upon transfer of control of the Company s promised services, which generally occurs upon the flight hours being used.
Any unused hours for the fractional jet and jet card programs are forfeited at the end of the contract term and are thus immediately
recognized as revenue at that time. 

Deferred
revenue is an obligation to transfer services to a customer for which the Company has already received consideration. Upon receipt of
a prepayment from a customer for all or a portion of the transaction price, the Company initially recognizes a contract liability. The
contract liability is settled, and revenue is recognized when the Company satisfies its performance obligation to the customer at a future
date. 

The
Company also generates revenues from individual ad hoc charter bookings processed through the Company s booking app, whereby the
Company will source, negotiate, and arrange travel on a charter basis for a customer based on pre-selected options and pricing provided
by the Company to the customer through the app. In addition, Cirrus markets charter on the Company s aircraft for the Company s
benefit. Deferred revenue with respect to bookings through the app was 56,000 as of September 30, 2024. 

The
Company utilizes certificated independent third-party air carriers in the performance of a portion of flights. The Company evaluates
whether there is a promise to transfer services to the customer, as the principal, or to arrange for services to be provided by another
party, as the agent, using a control model. The nature of the flight services the Company provides to members is similar regardless of
which third-party air carrier is involved. The Company directs third-party air carriers to provide an aircraft to a member or customer.
Based on evaluation of the control model, it was determined that the Company acts as the principal rather than the agent within all revenue
arrangements. Owner charter revenue is recognized for flights where the owner of a managed aircraft sets the price for the trip. The
Company records owner charter revenue at the time of flight on a net basis for the margin we receive to operate the aircraft. If the
Company has primary responsibility to fulfill the obligation, then the revenue and the associated costs are reported on a gross basis
in the consolidated statements of operations. 

37 

Flights 

Flights
and flight-related services, along with the related costs of the flights, are earned and recognized as revenue at the point in time in
which the service is provided. For round-trip flights, revenue is recognized upon arrival at the destination for each flight segment. 

Fractional
and jet card members pay a fixed quoted amount for flights based on a contractual capped hourly rate. Ad hoc charter customers primarily
pay a fixed rate for flights. In addition, flight costs are paid by members through the purchase of dollar-denominated prepaid blocks
of flight hours Prepaid Blocks ), and other incidental costs such as catering and ground transportation are billed monthly
as incurred. Prepaid Blocks are deferred and recognized as revenue when the member completes a flight segment. 

Aircraft
Management 

The
Company manages aircraft for owners in exchange for a contractual fee. Revenue associated with the management of aircraft also includes
the recovery of owner-incurred expenses including maintenance coordination, cabin crew and pilots, as well as recharging of certain incurred
aircraft operating costs and expenses such as maintenance, fuel, landing fees, parking and other related operating costs. The Company
passes the recovery and recharge costs back to owners at either cost or a predetermined margin. 

Aircraft
management-related revenue contains two types of performance obligations. One performance obligation is to provide management services
over the contract period. Revenue earned from management services is recognized over the contractual term, on a monthly basis. The second
performance obligation is the cost to operate and maintain the aircraft, which is recognized as revenue at the point in time such services
are completed. 

Aircraft
Sales 

The
Company acquires aircraft from vendors and various other second-party sellers in the private aviation industry. The Company s classifies
the purchase as aircraft inventory on the consolidated balance sheets. Aircraft inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable
value. Sales are recorded on a gross basis within revenues and cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. 

Pass-Through
Costs 

In
applying the guidance of ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in
an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine
revenue recognition for arrangements that the Company determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following
five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine
the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue
when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable
that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer.
At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, the Company assesses the goods or services
promised within each contract and determines those that are distinct performance obligations. The Company then assesses whether it is
acting as an agent or a principal for each identified performance obligation and includes revenue within the transaction price for second-party
costs when the Company determines that it is acting as the principal 

38 

Cost
of Sales 

The
cost of sales expenses includes costs incurred in providing air transportation services, such as chartering second-party aircraft, aircraft
lease expenses, pilot training and wages, aircraft fuel, aircraft maintenance, and other aircraft operating expenses. 

1. 
 Chartering
 Third-Party Aircraft: The cost of chartering second-party aircraft is recorded as a part of the cost of sales expense. These
 expenses include the fees paid to second-party operators for providing aircraft services on behalf of the company. Expenses are recognized
 in the income statement in the period when the service is rendered and are reported on an accrual basis. 

2. 
 Aircraft
 Lease Expenses: Aircraft lease expenses include the cost of leasing aircraft for the company s operations. The lease expenses
 are recognized as an operating expense in the income statement over the lease term on a straight-line basis. 

3. 
 Pilot
 Training and Wages: Pilot training costs are expensed as incurred and are included in the cost of sales expenses. This encompasses
 expenses related to initial pilot training, recurrent training, and any additional required training programs. Pilot wages, including
 salaries, bonuses, and benefits, are also recognized as a part of the cost of sales expenses and are reported on an accrual basis. 

4. 
 Aircraft
 Fuel: The cost of aircraft fuel is recognized as an expense in the cost of sales category based on the actual consumption during
 flight operations. Fuel costs are recorded in the income statement in the period when the fuel is consumed and are reported on an
 accrual basis. 

5. 
 Aircraft
 Maintenance: Aircraft maintenance expenses include both routine and non-routine maintenance. Routine maintenance costs are expensed
 as incurred and are recorded as a part of the cost of sales expense. Non-routine maintenance expenses, such as major repairs and
 overhauls, are capitalized and amortized over their expected useful life. The amortization expense is included in the cost of sales
 expense and is recognized in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the asset s useful life. 

6. 
 Other
 Aircraft Operating Expenses: Other aircraft operating expenses include costs such as insurance, landing fees, navigation charges,
 and catering services. These expenses are recognized in the income statement as a part of the cost of sales expenses in the period
 when they are incurred and are reported on an accrual basis. 

Stock-Based
Compensation 

The
Company accounts for stock awards under ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation . Under ASC 718, stock-based compensation
cost is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the employee s
requisite vesting period or over the nonemployee s period of providing goods or services. The fair value of each stock option or
warrant award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. 

Trend
Information 

The
Company s business and operations are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the U.S. and worldwide along with
local, state, federal and foreign governmental policy decisions. A host of factors beyond Jet.AI s control could cause fluctuations
in these conditions. Adverse conditions may include but are not limited to: changes in the airline industry, fuel and operating costs,
changes to corporate governance best practices for executive flying, general demand for private jet travel, regulations on carbon emissions
from aviation and market acceptance of the Company s business model. These adverse conditions could affect the Company s
financial condition and the results of operations.

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS. 

Except
with respect to the following risk factors, and the Company s on-going liquidity needs, there were no material changes in the risk
factors we previously disclosed in Item 1A to Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed
with the SEC on April 1, 2024. 

If
we fail to comply with the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, we would face possible delisting, which would result in a limited
public market for our shares, limit our ability to access existing liquidity facilities and make obtaining future financing more difficult
for us. 

Our
Common Stock is currently listed on Nasdaq under the symbol JTAI . On December 1, 2023, the Company received a notification
letter (the Initial Notice Letter from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Staff of Nasdaq notifying the Company that its
amount of stockholders equity has fallen below the 10 million required minimum for continued listing on The Nasdaq Global Market
set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b)(1)(A) (the Minimum Stockholders Equity Requirement ). The Company s
stockholders deficit as of December 31, 2023 was (3,963,039). The Initial Notice Letter also noted that as of September 30, 2023,
the Company did not meet The Nasdaq Global Market alternative listing criteria for the Market Value standard or the Total
Assets / Total Revenues standard. On August 14, 2024, the Nasdaq Hearings Panel granted the Company s request to transfer
the Company s securities from The Nasdaq Global Market to The Nasdaq Capital Market effective as of August 16, 2024. 

On
April 14, 2024, the Company received an additional notification letter from Nasdaq (the Second Notice Letter stating that
the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1), as the minimum bid price of the Company s Class A Common
Stock had been below 1.00 for 30 consecutive business days (the Minimum Bid Price Requirement ). The notification of noncompliance
has no immediate effect on the listing or trading of the Company s Common Stock on Nasdaq. The Company had 180 calendar days, or
until October 14, 2024, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. To regain compliance, the minimum bid price of the
Company s Common Stock must meet or exceed 1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days during this 180-calendar
day grace period. The Company did not regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement by October 14, 2024, however, the Company,
may be eligible for an additional 180-calendar day compliance period because it elected to transfer to The Nasdaq Capital Market. The
Company s failure to regain compliance during this period could result in delisting. The Company effected a reverse stock split
on November 12, 2024 to, in part, cause the Company to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. 

On
May 30, 2024, the Company received an additional notification letter from Nasdaq (the Third Notice Letter stating that
the Company has not regained compliance with the Minimum Stockholders Equity Requirement for continued listing discussed in the
Initial Notice Letter, which it was required to meet by May 29, 2024 pursuant to its compliance plan. The Third Notice Letter notified
the Company that, unless the Company requested an appeal hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the Panel by June 6,
2024, trading of the Company s Common Stock would be suspended at the opening of business on June 10, 2024, and a Form 25-NSE would
be filed with the SEC, which would remove the Company s securities from listing and registration on Nasdaq (such notification,
the Delisting Notice ). 

As
directed in the Third Notice Letter, the Company timely requested a hearing before the Panel and paid the applicable fee to appeal the
Delisting Notice. The Delisting Notice has no immediate effect on the listing or trading of the Company s Common Stock. The Company s
hearing request stayed the suspension of trading on the Company s securities, and the Company s securities continue to trade
on Nasdaq. On August 14, 2024, in connection the implementation of the Company s compliance plan, the Nasdaq Hearings Panel granted
the Company s request to transfer the Company s securities from The Nasdaq Global Market to The Nasdaq Capital Market effective
as August 16, 2024. Further the Nasdaq Hearings Panel granted the Company s request to have until November 26, 2024 to demonstrate
compliance with its previously submitted plan, a deadline that the Company believes to be attainable. The Company is working diligently
to cure the deficiencies set forth in the Delisting Notice and believes it can regain compliance with the continued listing requirements
on or before November 26, 2024. 

Although
the Company believes it will be able to achieve compliance with Nasdaq s continued listing requirements, there can be no assurance
that the Company will be able to regain compliance with all applicable requirements or maintain compliance with any other listing requirements
within the time frame required by Nasdaq or at all, particularly if the Company s stock price trades below 1.00 for a sustained
period. Nasdaq s determination that we fail to meet the continued listing standards of Nasdaq may result in our securities being
delisted from Nasdaq as set forth in the Delisting Notice. 

A
delisting of our Common Stock and our inability to list on another national securities market could negatively impact us by: (i) reducing
the liquidity and market price of our Common Stock; (ii) reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our Common Stock,
which could negatively impact our ability to raise equity financing; (iii) limiting our ability to use certain registration statements
to offer and sell freely tradable securities, thereby limiting our ability to access the public capital markets; and (iv) impairing our
ability to provide equity incentives to our employees. In addition, a delisting of our Common Stock would prevent us from being able
to access financing under the Share Purchase Agreement. Furthermore, the Company may have to pay all or a portion of the 800,000 commitment
fee due under the Share Purchase Agreement in cash if its shares are no longer listed. The Company may not have sufficient funds to be
able to pay such fee. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
Liquidity and Capital Resources.

Certain
Risks Associated with the Reverse Split 

We
cannot assure you that the Reverse Stock Split will increase our stock price over the long term. We expect that the 1-for-225
reverse split of our outstanding common stock effected on November 12, 2024 (the Reverse Split will increase the market
price of our common stock to a level that would attract more investors. However, the continuing effect of the Reverse Split on the market
price of our common stock cannot be predicted with any certainty, and the history of reverse stock splits for other companies is varied,
particularly since some investors may view a reverse stock split negatively. It is possible that ultimately the per share price of our
common stock after the Reverse Split will not increase in the same proportion as the reduction in the number of our outstanding shares
of common stock following the Reverse Split, or if the price does increase, that the price can be maintained for any particular period
of time. In either of those cases, such decline in price would cause a reduction in the value of our company as measured by our market
capitalization, and the Reverse Split may not result in a per share price that would attract brokers and investors who do not trade in
lower-priced stocks. In addition, although we believe the Reverse Split may enhance the desirability of our common stock to certain potential
investors, we cannot assure you that our common stock will be more attractive to institutional or other long-term investors. After the
Reverse Split, the market price of our common stock may ultimately decrease due to factors unrelated to the Reverse Split. In any case,
the market price of our common stock may also be based on other factors which may be unrelated to the number of shares outstanding, including
our future performance. After the consummation of the Reverse Split if the trading price of the common stock declines, the percentage
decline as an absolute number and as a percentage of our overall market capitalization may be greater than would have occurred in the
absence of the Reverse Split. 

Even
if the Reverse Split achieves the requisite increase in the market price of our common stock, we cannot assure you that we will be able
to continue to comply with the minimum price requirement of Nasdaq. Even if the Reverse Split achieves the requisite increase
in the market price of our common stock to be in compliance with the minimum bid price of the Nasdaq listing rules, there can be no assurance
that the market price of our common stock following the Reverse Split will continue to remain at the level required for continuing compliance
with that requirement. It is not uncommon for the market price of a company s common stock to decline in the period following a
reverse stock split. If the market price of our common stock declines following the effectuation of the Reverse Split, the percentage
decline may be greater than would occur in the absence of a reverse stock split. In any event, other factors unrelated to the number
of shares of our common stock outstanding, such as negative financial or operational results, could adversely affect the market price
of our common stock and jeopardize our ability to meet or maintain Nasdaq s minimum price requirement. 

The
Reverse Split may decrease the liquidity of our common stock. The liquidity of the shares of our common stock may be affected
adversely by the Reverse Split given the reduced number of shares that are outstanding following the Reverse Split, especially if the
market price of our common stock does not increase proportionality as a result of the Reverse Split. 

Because
the number of authorized shares of our common stock will not be reduced proportionately, the Reverse Stock Split increased the Board s
ability to issue authorized and unissued shares without further stockholder action. The Reverse Split did not serve to decrease
the authorized number of shares of common stock under our charter. Because the number of authorized shares of our common stock was not
reduced proportionately, the Reverse Split increased the Board s ability to issue authorized and unissued shares without further
stockholder action. Having a substantial number of authorized but unissued shares of stock, the issuance of which would be dilutive to
our existing stockholders and may cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock. With respect to authorized but unissued and
unreserved shares, we could also use such shares to oppose a hostile takeover attempt or delay or prevent changes in control or changes
in or removal of management. Other than the foregoing, there are no existing plans, arrangements or understandings relating to the issuance
of any of the authorized, but unissued and unreserved shares, whether available as a result of the Reverse Stock Split or otherwise.

2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS. 

Unregistered
Sales of Equity Securities 

On
various dates in the third quarter of 2024, the Company sold an aggregate of 6,222 shares of common stock to GEM under the Share Purchase
Agreement. The issuance of the securities was made in reliance upon the exemption from the registration requirements under Section 4(a)(2)
of the Securities Act of 1933. In October 2024, the Company issued 36,886 shares of common stock to satisfy in full the outstanding commitment
fee payable discussed in Note 5 and 44,225 shares of common stock under the Share Purchase Agreement with GEM for total consideration
of 822,745. 

On
various dates in the third quarter of 2024, the Company issued an aggregate of 14,778 shares of common stock to SHC under the Sunpeak
Settlement Agreement. The issuance of the securities was made in reliance upon the exemption from the registration requirements under
Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act of 1933. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued 14,333 shares of
common stock for settlement of approximately 265,000 in SHC Claims under the Sunpeak Settlement Agreement.

Exhibit 31.1 

Certification of Chief Executive Officer 

I, Mike Winston, certify that: 

1. 
 I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of Jet.AI Inc. (the registrant ); 

2. 
 Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;
