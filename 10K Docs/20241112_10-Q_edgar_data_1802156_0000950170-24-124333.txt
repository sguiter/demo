As the sole managing member of XPO LLC, the Company operates and controls all of the business and affairs of XPO LLC. The Company consolidates XPO LLC on its condensed consolidated financial statements and records a noncontrolling interest related to the Class B units held by the Class B stockholders on its condensed consolidated balance sheet and statement of operations.

 . Receivables are unsecured; however, the franchise agreements provide the Company the right to withdraw funds from the franchisee s bank account or to terminate the franchise for nonpayment. The Company s accounts and notes receivable are recorded at net realizable value, which includes an appropriate allowance for expected credit losses. On a periodic basis, the Company evaluates its accounts and notes receivable balances and establishes an allowance for expected credit losses. The estimate of expected credit losses is based upon historical bad debts, current receivable balances, age of receivable balances, the franchisee s or customer s financial condition and ability to comply with credit terms and current economic trends, all of which are subject to change. Actual uncollected amounts have historically been consistent with the Company s expectations. Account balances are written off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote .

, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement APA to purchase studios to operate as company-owned transition studios from the original founder sellers of the Rumble brand, which was acquired by the Company in 2021 (the Rumble Sellers and were franchisees and shareholders of the Company. This acquisition was expected to enhance the operational performance of the Rumble studios as the Company prepared them to be licensed to new franchisees. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires the assets acquired to be recorded at their respective fair value as of the date of the transaction. The Company also entered into a mutual termination agreement with the Rumble Sellers to terminate their existing franchise agreements, resulting in cash received and a gain of , which is included within selling, general and administrative expenses. Under the APA, consideration for the acquisition included , which was recorded as a reduction to receivable from shareholder.

Reduction to receivable from shareholder 

The resulting goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies from the integration of studios, increased expansion for market opportunities and the expansion of studio membership and is expected to be tax deductible. The fair value of the property and equipment was based on the replacement cost method. The fair value of the right-of-use assets was determined using the income approach. The deferred revenue represents prepaid classes and class packages. The Company will recognize revenue over time as the members attend and utilize the classes. The fair value of the reacquired franchise rights after termination of the existing franchise agreements was based on the excess earnings method and was considered to have an eight-year life. The acquisition was not material to the results of operations of the Company. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement with a franchisee under which the Company repurchas ed studio t o operate as a company-owned transition studio. The purchase price for the acquisition was , less of net deferred revenue and deferred costs resulting in total purchase consideration of . 

Reacquired franchise rights 

Total purchase price 

The fair value of reacquired franchise rights was based on the excess earnings method and was considered to have an approximate life.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company refranchised operations at and company-owned transition studios, respectively, received proceeds of and , respectively, and recorded a net loss of and on disposal of the studio assets, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company also ceased operations at and company-owned transition studios, respectively. The Company refranchised or closed company-owned transition studios under its restructuring plan that started in the third quarter of 2023. See Note 17 for further discussion of the Company's restructuring plan. On December 31, 2023, the Company entered into agreements to sell six Rumble company-owned transition studios (the Rumble Held for Sale Studios ). These agreements triggered the reclassification of Rumble Held for Sale Studios to assets held for sale. Based on the expected net sales proceeds the Company determined the Rumble Held for Sale Studios to be fully impaired and recognized an impairment of , within impairment of goodwill and other assets, for studio assets during the year ended December 31, 2023, consisting of property and equipment of and reacquired franchise assets of . The sale was completed during the three months ended March 31, 2024. When the Company believes that a studio will be refranchised for a price less than its carrying value but does not believe the studio has met the criteria to be classified as held for sale, the Company reviews the studio for impairment. The Company evaluates the recoverability of the studio assets by comparing estimated sales proceeds plus holding period cash flows, if any, to the carrying value of the studio. For studio assets that are not deemed to be recoverable, the Company recognizes impairment for any excess of carrying value over the fair value of the studios, which is based on the expected net sales proceeds. During the three and nine months ended

In total under the ASR Program, the Company repurchased and immediately retired shares of Class A common stock. The final number of shares received by the Company was based on the daily volume-weighted average stock price of the Company s Class A common stock during the duration of the ASR Program, less a discount and adjustments pursuant to the terms and conditions of the ASR Program agreement.

At September 30, 2024, there were no profit interest units outstanding as the last of these profit interest units vested in August 2024. Liability classified restricted stock units In November 2021, the Company granted RSU awards with performance conditions of meeting certain EBITDA targets through the year ending December 31, 2024. The awards were granted with fixed dollar valuation and the number of shares granted depends on the trading price at the closing date of the period in which the EBITDA target is met. As such, these awards are classified as a liability. Management performs a regular assessment to determine the likelihood of meeting the targets and adjusts the expense recognized if necessary. During the first quarter of 2023, the performance condition of an award with a total fixed dollar value of was met and unit s were earned and issued as shares. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company determined that it is no longer probable that the EBITDA targets will be achieved for the remaining RSU awards granted in November 2021. Accordingly, the Company reversed all previously recognized stock-based compensation expense related to these awards. Equity classified restricted stock units

RSUs are valued at the Company s closing stock price on the date of grant, and generally vest over a one - to period. Compensation expense for RSUs is recognized on a straight-line basis. During 2023, performance-based RSUs were earned and issued as shares and performance-based RSUs were cancelled or forfeited. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, performance-based RSUs were earned and issued as shares and performance-based RSUs were forfeited. During 2024, the Company granted performance-based RSUs, of which contained performance conditions and contained market conditions, with weighted average grant-date fair values of and , respectively. To estimate the fair value of performance-based awards containing a market condition, the Company uses the Monte Carlo valuation model. For other share-based awards, the fair value is generally based on the closing price of the Company s Class A Common Stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant. As of September 30, 2024, the achievement of remaining performance metrics for performance-based RSUs containing performance conditions is considered probable. Stock-based compensation expense

 economic interest in XPO Holdings. The provision for income taxes differs from the amount of income tax computed by applying the applicable U.S. statutory federal income tax rate of to income (loss) before income taxes due to XPO Holdings pass-through structure for U.S. income tax purposes, state taxes, preferred stock dividends, non-deductible expenses, change in fair value of contingent consideration and the valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , is and , respectively, and and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company recognized income tax expense of and , respectively, on its share of pre-tax book income (loss), exclusive of the noncontrolling interest of . During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , the Company recognized income tax expense of and , respectively, on its share of pre-tax book income, exclusive of the noncontrolling interest of . As of September 30, 2024, management determined based on applicable accounting standards and the weight of all available evidence, it was not more likely than not MLTN that the Company will generate sufficient taxable income to realize its deferred tax assets including the difference in tax basis in excess of the financial reporting value for its investment in XPO Holdings. Consequently, the Company has established a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2024. In the event that management subsequently determines that it is MLTN that the Company will realize its deferred tax assets in the future over the recorded amount, a decrease to the valuation allowance will be made, which will reduce the provision for income taxes. The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is not currently under examination by income tax authorities in federal, state or other jurisdictions. The Company's foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to examination following the year in which the tax obligation originated. The years subject to audit may be extended if the entity substantially understates corporate income tax. The Company does not expect a significant change in unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months. Tax receivable agreement In connection with the IPO, the Company entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement TRA pursuant to which the Company is generally required to pay to the other parties thereto in the aggregate 85 of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that the Company actually realizes as a result of: (i) certain favorable tax attributes acquired from Rumble Holdings LLC and H W Investco Blocker II, LP (the Blocker Companies in the mergers of the Blocker Companies with and into XPO Inc. (including net operating losses and the Blocker Companies allocable share of existing tax basis); (ii) increases in the Company's allocable share of existing tax basis and tax basis adjustments that resulted or may result from (x) the IPO Contribution and the Class A-5 Unit Redemption, (y) future taxable redemptions and exchanges of LLC Units by Continuing Pre-IPO LLC Members and (z) certain payments made under the TRA; and (iii) deductions attributable to imputed interest pursuant to the TRA (the TRA Payments ). The Company expects to benefit from the remaining of any tax benefits that it may actually realize. The TRA Payments are not conditioned upon any continued ownership interest in XPO Holdings or the Company. To the extent that the Company is unable to timely make payments under the TRA for any reason, such payments generally will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid.

 basis points from the due date (without extensions) of such tax return. The TRA provides that if (i) there is a material breach of any material obligations under the TRA; or (ii) the Company elects an early termination of the TRA, then the TRA will terminate and the Company's obligations, or the Company's successor s obligations, under the TRA will accelerate and become due and payable, based on certain assumptions, including an assumption that the Company would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize all potential future tax benefits that are subject to the TRA and that any LLC Units that have not been exchanged are deemed exchanged for the fair market value of the Company's Class A common stock at the time of termination. The TRA also provides that, upon certain mergers, asset sales or other forms of business combination, or certain other changes of control, the TRA will not terminate but the Company s or the Company s successor s obligations with respect to tax benefits would be based on certain assumptions, including that the Company or the Company s successor would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the increased tax deductions and tax basis and other benefits covered by the TRA. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company has concluded, based on applicable accounting standards, that it was more likely than not that its deferred tax assets subject to the TRA would not be realized. Therefore, the Company has not recorded a liability related to the tax savings it may realize from utilization of such deferred tax assets. Except for and of the current and non-current portions of the TRA, respectively, of the TRA liability was not recorded as of September 30, 2024 . If utilization of the deferred tax asset subject to the TRA becomes more likely than not in the future, the Company will record a liability related to the TRA which will be recognized as expense within its consolidated statements of operations. 

 shares and shares for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The potentially dilutive impact of RSUs is calculated using the treasury stock method. The potential dilutive effects of Class B common stock were determined to be anti-dilutive for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and were excluded from the computation of diluted net earnings (loss) per share. Because the Company reported a net loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents are antidilutive and have been excluded from the calculation of diluted net earnings (loss) per share.

 and , which is included in accrued expenses in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company maintains insurance coverage which may cover certain losses and legal costs incurred. When losses exceed the applicable policy deductible and realization of recovery of the loss from existing insurance policies is deemed probable, the Company records receivables from the insurance company for the excess amount. The Company has not recorded any provision for insurance reimbursement as of September 30, 2024. On November 22, 2023, former employees of a former franchisee of the Company filed a putative class action complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, captioned Shannon McGill et al. v. Xponential Fitness LLC, et al., Case No. 2:23-cv-03909, against the Company, as well as against a former franchisee of the Company and the franchisee s legal entity, MD Pro Fitness, LLC. The complaint alleges violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act, as well as employment laws from different states in connection with the franchisee s owner-operated studio locations. The Company was served with the complaint on December 4, 2023. The Company intends to defend itself in this litigation. The Company recorded an accrual for estimated loss contingencies associated with this matter, which is included in accrued expenses in the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024, based on currently available information. The accrual does not reflect the Company s views of the merits of claims in this action. On February 28, 2024 , the landlord (the "New York Rumble Landlord") for a Rumble studio located in New York, New York (the "New York Studio") filed an Affidavit of Confession of Judgment with the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York (the Court ), against Rumble Fitness, LLC (the Rumble Sellers ), in its capacity as the former tenant under the lease for the New York Studio (the "New York Lease"), for rent arrears; which filing was triggered by the Company's failure to pay rent. As the current tenant under the New York Lease, the Company had been negotiating a settlement with the New York Rumble Landlord to settle all rent arrears, future rent, and to terminate the New York Lease. On October 15, 2024, the Company entered into two settlement agreements with the New York Rumble Landlord pursuant to which the parties agreed to terminate the New York Lease and settle all amounts owed for rent arrears and future rent. The Company recorded an accrual for estimated loss contingencies associated with this matter, which is included in accrued expenses in the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024. On February 9, 2024, a federal securities class action lawsuit was filed against the Company and certain of the Company s officers in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The complaint alleged, among other things, violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, regarding misstatements and/or omissions in certain of the Company s financial statements, press releases, and SEC filings made during the putative class period of July 26, 2021 through December 7, 2023. On July 26, 2024, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, adding three Company directors as defendants, as well as the underwriters from the Company s April 6, 2022 secondary offering, additionally bringing claims under Sections 11, 12(a)(2), and 15 of the Securities Act, and alleging a putative class period of July 23, 2021 through May 10, 2024. The Company intends to defend itself against this action and filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on October 8, 2024. The Court has scheduled a hearing on the Company s motion to dismiss for February 14, 2025. The litigation is preliminary in nature and involves substantial uncertainties and the Company believes that a loss is not probable or estimable at this time. However, there can be no assurance that such legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. On March 10, 2024, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California by Gideon Akande, allegedly on behalf of Xponential Fitness, Inc., against certain current officers and directors as defendants,

 Government investigations On December 5, 2023, the Company was contacted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), requesting that the Company provide it with certain information and documents. The Company received notice on May 7, 2024 of an investigation by the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Central District of California (the USAO ). On July 29, 2024, the Company received a civil investigative demand from the United States Federal Trade Commission (the FTC ). The Company intends to cooperate fully with the SEC, USAO and FTC in these investigations, and the Company has incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenses related to legal and other professional services in connection with matters relating to or arising from these investigations. At this stage, the Company is unable to assess whether any material loss or adverse effect is reasonably possible as a result of these investigations or estimate the range of any potential loss. Contingent consideration from acquisitions In connection with the Reorganization Transactions, the Parent merged with and into the Member. The Company recorded contingent consideration equal to the fair value of the shares issued in connection with the Rumble acquisition of and a receivable from shareholder for debt financing provided to the Rumble Seller. The shares issued to the Rumble Seller are treated as a liability on the Company's balance sheet as they are subject to vesting conditions. The fair value of the contingent consideration is measured at estimated fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation analysis, which represents a Level 3 measurement. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an increase of and to contingent consideration, respectively, which were recorded as acquisition and transaction expense. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded a decrease to contingent consideration of and , respectively, which was recorded as acquisition and transaction income. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, contingent consideration of and , respectively, was recorded as contingent consideration from acquisitions in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. In connection with the October 2021 acquisition of BFT, the Company agreed to pay contingent consideration to the seller consisting of quarterly cash payments based on the sales of the franchise system and equipment packages in the U.S. and Canada, as well as a percentage of royalties collected by the Company, provided that aggregate minimum payments of AUD (approximately USD based on the currency exchange rate as of the purchase date) are required to be paid to the seller for the two-year period ended December 31, 2023. The aggregate amount of such payments is subject to a maximum of AUD (approximately USD based on the currency exchange rate as of the purchase date). At the acquisition date, the Company determined that the fair value of the estimated contingent consideration liability was . The Company recorded additional contingent consideration of and during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, and and during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, which was recorded as interest expense. The Company recorded a change to contingent consideration of and during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, and and during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively, which was recorded as acquisition and transaction expense

 contingent consideration during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, contingent consideration of and was recorded as accrued expenses, respectively, and and was recorded as contingent consideration from acquisitions, respectively, in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. In addition, in connection with the October 2021 acquisition of BFT, the Company entered into a Master Franchise Agreement MFA with an affiliate of the Seller (the Master Franchisee ), pursuant to which the Company granted the Master Franchisee the master franchise rights for the BFT TM brands on a global basis, excluding the United States and Canada. In exchange, the Company is entitled to receive certain fees and royalties, including a percentage of the revenue generated by the Master Franchisee under the MFA. The MFA contains an option for the Company to repurchase the master franchise rights granted under the MFA at a purchase price based on the Master Franchisee s EBITDA, which has been extended to 2025. If the Company (or a designee of the Company) does not exercise the option pursuant to the terms of the MFA, then the Company might be required to pay a cancellation fee to the Master Franchisee which might be material to the Company. If the Master Franchisee rejects an offer to repurchase the franchise rights, then the cancellation fee is not required to be paid. The Company believes the likelihood of a cancellation payment being required is remote as of September 30, 2024, and therefore no accrual has been recorded. In connection with the January 2024 acquisition of Lindora, the Company agreed to pay contingent consideration to the seller subject to the achievement of certain milestones. Payment of additional consideration is contingent on Lindora reaching two milestones based on a certain gross sales target and the number of operating clinics during the 15-month and 24-month period following the acquisition date, respectively. At the acquisition date, the Company determined that the fair value of the estimated contingent consideration liability was . The Company recorded additional contingent consideration of and during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, which was recorded as interest expense. The Company recorded additional contingent consideration of and during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, which was recorded as acquisition and transaction expense. At September 30, 2024, contingent consideration of and was recorded as accrued expenses and contingent consideration from acquisitions, respectively, in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Letter of credit In July 2022, the Company issued a standby letter of credit to a third-party financing company, who provides loans to the Company's qualified franchisees. The standby letter of credit is contingent upon the failure of franchisees to perform according to the terms of underlying contracts with the third party. The Company deposited cash in a restricted account as collateral for the standby letter of credit. The Company has determined the fair value of these guarantees at inception was not material, and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and accrual has been recorded for the Company s potential obligation under its guaranty arrangement, respectively. Lease guarantees The Company has guaranteed lease agreements for certain franchisees. The Company s maximum obligation, as a result of its guarantees of leases, is approximately and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and would only require payment upon default by the primary obligor. The Company has determined the fair value of these guarantees at inception is not material, and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and accrual has been recorded for the Company s potential obligation under its guaranty arrangement.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and the other financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results and timing may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, particularly in the section titled Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations and Risk Factors and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Xponential Fitness LLC XPO LLC ), the principal operating subsidiary of Xponential Fitness, Inc. (the Company or XPO Inc., we, us, and our ), is the largest global franchisor of boutique fitness brands. Pursuant to a reorganization into a holding company structure, the Company is a holding company with its principal asset being a 66.7 ownership interest in XPO LLC through its ownership interest in Xponential Intermediate Holdings, LLC XPO Holdings ). 
 We operate a diversified platform of nine brands spanning across verticals including Pilates, indoor cycling, barre, stretching, dancing, boxing, functional training, metabolic health and yoga. In partnership with its franchisees and master franchisees, XPO LLC offers energetic, accessible, and personalized workout experiences led by highly qualified instructors in studio locations throughout North America and internationally, with franchise, master franchise and international expansion agreements in 49 U.S. states, Puerto Rico, and 27 additional countries as of September 30, 2024. The Company's portfolio of brands includes Club Pilates, the largest Pilates brand in the United States; CycleBar, the largest indoor cycling brand in the United States; StretchLab, a concept offering one-on-one and group stretching services; AKT, a dance-based cardio workout concept that combines toning, interval and circuit training; YogaSix, the largest franchised yoga brand in the United States; Pure Barre, a total body workout that uses the ballet barre to perform small isometric movements, and the largest barre brand in the United States; Rumble, a boxing-inspired full-body workout; BFT, a functional training and strength-based program; and Lindora, a provider of medically guided wellness and metabolic health solutions, which was acquired on January 2, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 2,722 studios were open in North America (consists of Canada, the United States and U.S. territories) and franchisees were contractually committed to open 1,735 additional studios under existing franchise agreements. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, we had 456 studios open internationally and our master franchisees were contractually obligated to sell licenses to franchisees to open an additional 1,093 new studios, of which master franchisees have sold 245 licenses for studios not yet opened as of September 30, 2024. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated revenue outside the United States of 10.4 million and 10.3 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we did not have material assets located outside of the United States. No franchisee accounted for more than 5 of our revenue. We operate in one segment for financial reporting purposes. 
 Appointment of New Chief Executive Officer and Director 
 On May 10, 2024, Mr. Anthony Geisler, our former Chief Executive Officer and member of our board of directors, was removed by our board of directors from his duties and suspended indefinitely as Chief Executive Officer. At that time, our board of directors appointed Ms. Brenda Morris, a member of our board of directors since 2019, to serve as our interim Chief Executive Officer. On May 13, 2024, Mr. Geisler resigned as Chief Executive Officer, effective immediately. 
 On June 17, 2024, we announced that our board of directors had unanimously appointed Mr. Mark King as Chief Executive Officer effective June 17, 2024. Mr. King also joined our board of directors. At that time, Ms. Morris ceased serving as interim Chief Executive Officer but continues to serve as a member of our board of directors. Mr. King is a highly innovative, growth-oriented leader with an established track record scaling iconic global consumer brands and franchisors. 
 Lindora Acquisition 
 On December 1, 2023, we entered into an agreement to acquire Lindora Franchise, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, the franchisor of the Lindora wellness brand (the Lindora Franchisor ), for cash consideration of 8.5 million. The transaction also includes up to 1.0 million of contingent consideration which is subject to the achievement of certain milestones. The Lindora Franchisor was a subsidiary of Lindora Wellness, Inc. Lindora Wellness ). Lindora Wellness has owned and operated each of the Lindora clinics in California for at least 25 years and currently owns and operates 30 Lindora clinics in California and a single Lindora clinic in the state of Washington. Immediately prior to the execution of the purchase agreement on December 1, 2023, Lindora Wellness signed 31 franchise agreements with the Lindora Franchisor pursuant to which Lindora Wellness will continue to operate its Lindora clinics as a franchisee of the Lindora Franchisor. The acquisition of the Lindora Franchisor was completed on January 2, 2024. Lindora complements

our existing brands and will help us deliver on consumers increasing demand for a holistic approach to health. See Note 3 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 Divestiture of Stride and Row House Brands 
 On February 13, 2024, we entered into an agreement with a buyer, pursuant to which we divested the Stride brand, including the intellectual property, franchise rights and franchise agreements for open studios. The buyer of the Stride brand is a member of management and one of our shareholders. We received no consideration from the divestiture of the Stride brand and will assist the buyer with transition support including cash payments of approximately 0.3 million payable over the 12-month period following divestiture. 
 On May 20, 2024, we entered into an agreement with a buyer, pursuant to which we divested the Row House brand, including the intellectual property, franchise rights and franchise agreements for open studios, and retained certain liabilities, including liabilities related to known litigation, pre-litigation, and disputes as of the closing of the divestiture. We received no consideration from the divestiture of the Row House brand. 
 These divestitures allow us to better focus and utilize our resources on our other brands. 
 Wind down of AKT brand franchise operations 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we announced that we would wind down AKT franchise operations. As part of the wind down, we began terminating franchise agreements with existing AKT studios and signed a licensing agreement with a former franchisee for no consideration received. 
 Restructuring Plan 
 In the third quarter of 2023, we began a restructuring plan that involves exiting company-owned transition studios and other measures designed to reduce costs to achieve our long-term margin goals and focus on pure franchise operations. The plan was approved and initiated in the third quarter of 2023 and is expected to continue throughout 2024; however, ultimate timing will depend on lease termination negotiations. During the fourth quarter of 2023, our restructuring plan was expanded due to the addition of Rumble company-owned transition studios to the restructuring plan and a refranchising plan that was terminated by the Company due to the refranchisor s non-compliance with the franchise agreements and the subsequent closure of certain studios. This refranchise termination resulted in us incurring losses for contract termination expenses, other expenses associated with exiting the studios, and loss contingencies related to the refranchisor s unpaid payroll. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized total restructuring charges of 12.2 million, net of gains, and 21.4 million, net of gains, respectively, primarily for contract termination and other associated costs, loss on lease terminations and sale or disposal of assets, impairment of right-of-use assets, and other restructuring charges. 
 We expect to recognize additional restructuring charges throughout 2024 and 2025 totaling approximately 11.5 million to 15.5 million for rent expense, including amortization of the right-of-use assets and accretion of the operating lease liability, lease termination gains or losses, and other variable lease costs related to company-owned transition studios and other restructuring charges. We are considering subleases or negotiating lease terminations for operating leases for certain studios for which we have lease liabilities recorded and the expected cash payments and expenses to exit the lease may be greater than expected rent expense for that period, depending on the outcome of lease negotiations. Cash outflows related to these lease terminations are expected to be incurred throughout 2024 and 2025. 
 Once completed we estimate annualized savings of approximately 13.5 million to 15.5 million under the restructuring plan. Additionally, we may not be able to fully realize the cost savings and benefits initially anticipated from the restructuring plan, the expected charges may be greater than expected, and we may not be able to reach agreement with contractual counterparties, any of which could negatively impact our business. See Note 17 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations 
 In addition to the impact of the risks described under Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, we believe that the most significant factors affecting our results of operations include: 
 Licensing new qualified franchisees, selling additional licenses to existing franchisees and opening studios. Our growth depends upon our success in licensing new studios to new and existing franchisees. We believe our success in attracting new franchisees and attracting existing franchisees to invest in additional studios has resulted from our diverse offering of attractive brands, corporate level support, training provided to franchisees and the opportunity to realize attractive returns 

34 

on their invested capital. We believe our significant investments in centralized systems and infrastructure help support new and existing franchisees. To continue to attract qualified new franchisees, sell additional studios to existing franchisees and assist franchisees in opening their studios, we plan to continue to invest in our brands to enable them to deliver positive consumer experiences and in our integrated services at the brand level to support franchisees. 

Timing of studio openings. Our revenue growth depends to a significant extent on the number of studios that are open and operating. Many factors affect whether a new studio will be opened on time, if at all, including the availability and cost of financing, selection and availability of suitable studio locations, delays in hiring personnel as well as any delays in equipment delivery or installation. To the extent franchisees are unable to open new studios on the timeline we anticipate, or at all, we will not realize the revenue growth that we expect. We believe our investments in centralized systems and infrastructure, including real estate site selection, studio build-out and design assistance help enable franchisees to open studios in a timely manner, and we plan to continue to invest in our systems to continue to provide assistance during the opening process. 

Increasing same store sales. Our long-term revenue prospects are driven in part by franchisees ability to increase same store sales (discussed below). Several factors affect our same store sales in any given period, including the number of stores that have been in operation for a significant period of time, growth in total memberships and marketing and promotional efforts. We expect to continue to seek to grow same store sales and Average Unit Volumes AUVs by helping franchisees acquire new members, increase studio utilization and drive increased spend from consumers. We also intend to expand ancillary revenue streams, such as our digital platform offerings and retail merchandise. 

International and domestic expansion. We continue to invest in increasing the number of franchisees outside of North America. We have developed strong relationships and executed committed development contracts with master franchisees to propel our international growth. We plan to continue to invest in these relationships and seek new relationships and opportunities, including through acquisitions and partnerships, in countries that we have targeted for expansion. In the U.S., we may from time to time consider acquisition of and partnership with certain complimentary assets or businesses that can enhance and expand our brands and operations. 

Demand and competition for consumer income . Our revenue and future success will depend in part on the attractiveness of our brands and the services provided by franchisees relative to other fitness and entertainment options available to consumers. Our franchisees AUVs are dependent upon the performance of studios and may be impacted by reduced capacity as a result of various factors, including shifting consumer demand and behavior for fitness services. Macroeconomic factors such as inflation and recession, and economic factors affecting a particular geographic territory, may also increase competition for discretionary income, impact the returns generated by franchisees and therefore impact our operating results. 

Key Performance Indicators 
 In addition to our financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP ), we regularly review the following key metrics to measure performance, identify trends, formulate financial projections, compensate our employees, and monitor our business. While we believe that these metrics are useful in evaluating our business, other companies may not use similar metrics or may not calculate similarly titled metrics in a consistent manner. 
 All metrics in this Key Performance Indicators section are presented on an adjusted basis to reflect historical information of Lindora prior to the acquisition by the Company in January 2024 and on an adjusted basis to remove historical information for both Stride and Row House prior to their divestitures by the Company in February 2024 and May 2024, respectively. Historical information has not been adjusted to reflect the wind-down of AKT. All references to these metrics in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations use this same basis of reporting, unless noted otherwise.

System-Wide Sales 
 System-wide sales represent gross sales by all studios in North America. System-wide sales includes sales by franchisees that are not revenue realized by us in accordance with GAAP. While we do not record sales by franchisees as revenue, and such sales are not included in our consolidated financial statements, this operating metric relates to our revenue because we receive approximately 7 and 2 of the sales by franchisees as royalty revenue and marketing fund revenue, respectively. We believe that this operating measure aids in understanding how we derive our royalty revenue and marketing fund revenue and is important in evaluating our performance. System-wide sales growth is driven by new studio openings and increases in same store sales. Management reviews system-wide sales weekly, which enables us to assess changes in our franchise revenue, overall studio performance, the health of our brands and the strength of our market position relative to competitors. 
 New Studio Openings 
 The number of new studio openings reflects the number of studios opened during a particular reporting period. We consider a new studio to be open once the studio begins offering classes. Opening new studios is an important part of our growth strategy. New studios may not generate material revenue in the early period following an opening and their revenue may not follow historical patterns. Management reviews the number of new studio openings in order to help forecast operating results and to monitor studio opening processes. 
 Studios No Longer Operating 
 A studio is considered no longer operating and excluded from the total number of studios operating if (a) the Company has reason to believe, after reasonable inquiry, that the studio is permanently closed, with no plans for re-opening or relocation, or (b) it has no sales for nine consecutive months or more, whichever comes first. If a studio deemed to be no longer operating subsequently generates sales at a future date, it re-enters the operating studio count (and the number of studios no longer operating is reduced). Studios classified as no longer operating are deemed permanently closed. 
 Number of Studios Operating 
 In addition to the number of new studios opened and studios no longer operating during a period, we track the number of total studios operating at the end of a reporting period. This number represents studios that have already opened, are generating revenue, and are regularly holding classes, though this number could include some number of studios that have temporarily suspended operations, but that are not permanently closed and have not yet met the definition for a Studio No Longer Operating. The number of studios that have temporarily suspended operations is an immaterial percentage of our total studio base. 
 Please see the table in the Same Store Sales section, sub header North America studios contributing to same store sales. The line studios without 13 months of consecutive sales as of the last month that had positive sales within the period being measured is an indicator for the number of North America traditional location studios that are older than 13 months, and that have had a recent or current disruption in sales, but that are still included in the Number of Studios Operating count. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, this represented 0.7 and 0.6 , respectively, of our North America studio base. While nearly all our franchised studios are licensed to franchisees, from time to time we operate a limited number of company-owned transition studios (typically as we take possession of a studio following a franchisee ceasing to operate it and as we prepare it to be licensed to a new franchisee). Management reviews the number of studios operating at a given point in time in order to help forecast system-wide sales, franchise revenue, and other revenue streams.

Non-Traditional Studio Locations 
 Non-traditional studio locations refers to studios that are not operated as standalone studio locations. There are currently 22 non-traditional studio locations globally, which are comprised of studios operated inside of other fitness facilities and on cruise ships. 
 Licenses Sold 
 The number of licenses sold in North America and globally reflect the cumulative number of licenses sold by us (or, outside of North America, by our master franchisees), since inception through the date indicated. The number of licenses sold is not reduced by terminations. The number of licenses sold does not generally include license renewals or licenses issued in connection with a change in 
 38 

ownership of operating studios. Licenses contractually obligated to open refer to licenses sold net of opened studios and terminations. Licenses contractually obligated to be sold internationally reflect the number of licenses that master franchisees are contractually obligated to sell to franchisees to open internationally that have not yet opened as of the date indicated. The number of licenses contractually obligated to open is a useful indicator of the number of studios that may open in the future, although it is not certain that these studios will open. Management reviews the number of licenses sold and the number of licenses contractually obligated to open to help monitor and forecast studio growth, system-wide sales and revenue streams. 
 Average Unit Volume 
 AUV is calculated by dividing sales during the applicable period for all studios contributing to AUV by the number of studios contributing to AUV. All traditional studio locations in North America are included in the AUV calculation, so long as they meet certain time since opening and sales criteria (as defined immediately below). In particular, AUV (LTM as of period end) and Quarterly AUV (run rate) are calculated as follows: 
 AUV (LTM as of period end) consists of the average sales for the trailing 12 calendar months for all traditional studio locations in North America that opened at least 13 calendar months ago as of the measurement date and that have generated positive sales for each of the last 13 calendar months as of the measurement date. 

Quarterly AUV (run rate) consists of average quarterly sales for all traditional studio locations in North America that had opened at least six calendar months ago as of the beginning of the respective quarter, and that have non-zero sales in the respective quarter (including nominal or negative sales figures; the only figures excluded are exact 0 amounts in the quarter), multiplied by four. 

We measure sales for AUV based solely upon monthly sales as derived through the designated point-of-sale system. AUV is impacted by changes in same store sales, studio openings, and studio closures. Management reviews AUV to assess studio economics. 
 The following table reconciles our North America operating studios for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, to the total studios contributing to both AUV (LTM as of period end) and Quarterly AUV (run rate):

Same Store Sales 
 Same store sales refer to period-over-period sales comparisons for the base of studios. We define the same store sales base to include monthly sales for any traditional studio location in North America. If the studio has generated at least 13 months of consecutive positive sales and opened at least 13 calendars months ago as of any month within the measurement period, the respective comparable months will be included. We measure same store sales based solely upon monthly sales as derived through the designated point-of-sale system. This measure highlights the performance of existing studios, while excluding the impact of new studio openings. Management reviews same store sales to assess the health of the franchised studios.

The increase 
 41 

in franchise royalty fees and technology fees was primarily due to an increase in same store sales and an increase in number of operating studios globally since September 30, 2023 (including studios related to the Lindora acquisition in the first quarter of 2024), which also contributed to the increase in franchise territory fees. The increase in franchise territory fees is also attributed to an increase in franchise agreement terminations year-over-year. 
 Equipment revenue. Equipment revenue was 14.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 12.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 2.1 million, or 17 .

The average revenue per installation increased in the three months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in average revenue was due to brand mix and a higher proportion of equipment installed with brands with higher equipment prices. 
 Merchandise revenue. Merchandise revenue was 6.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 8.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 1.9 million, or 23 . The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in demand from studios, current year sales promotions and a lower number of company-owned transition studios in the current year period. 
 Franchise marketing fund revenue. Franchise marketing fund revenue was 8.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 1.6 million, or 23 . The increase was primarily due to an increase in same store sales and an increase in number of operating studios in North America since September 30, 2023 (including studios related to the Lindora acquisition in the first quarter of 2024). 
 Other service revenue. Other service revenue was 6.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 16.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 9.8 million, or 61 .

Costs of product revenue as a percentage of related revenue increased to 80 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 60 in the comparable prior year period. The increase was due to current year sales promotions that decreased gross margin and to an increase in write downs of slow-moving inventory. 
 Costs of franchise and service revenue. Costs of franchise and service revenue was 4.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 1.3 million, or 37 . The increase was primarily due to a 1.3 million increase in franchise sales commissions, consistent with the related franchise territory revenue increase. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were 46.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 43.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 2.3 million, or 5 . The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in legal expenses of 9.8 million related to various legal matters; an increase in restructuring and related charges of 2.8 million in the current year period; and an increase in equity-based compensation expense of 1.4 million primarily due to an increase in the number of equity-classified restricted stock units RSUs outstanding during the current year period, partially offset by a decrease in salaries and wages of 4.9 million related to a lower average number of company-owned transition studios; a decrease in occupancy expenses of 4.9 million primarily related to a decrease in the number of company-owned 
 42 

transition studios; a decrease in marketing and advertising expenses of 1.4 million; and a net decrease in other variable expenses of 0.5 million. 
 Impairment of goodwill and other assets. Impairment of goodwill and other assets was 4.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 0.2 million, or 4 . The decrease was primarily due to a write down of right-of-use assets and intangible assets of 4.5 million related to studio exits in conjunction with our restructuring plan and wind down of AKT franchise operations in the current year period compared to 4.7 million in the prior year primarily related to goodwill and intangible asset write downs related to Stride and Row House.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe the following non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance. We use the following non-GAAP financial information to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, is helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance. In addition, our management uses non-GAAP measures to compare our performance relative to forecasts and to benchmark our performance externally against competitors. However, non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate and present similarly titled non-GAAP measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measure as tools for comparison. A reconciliation is provided below for the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures stated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. 
 We believe that the non-GAAP financial measures presented below, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our business, results of operations or outlook. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 We define adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA (net income/loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), adjusted for the impact of certain non-cash and other items that we do not consider in our evaluation of ongoing operating performance. These items include equity-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes, acquisition and transaction expenses (income) (including change in contingent consideration and transaction bonuses), litigation expenses (consisting of legal and related fees for specific proceedings 
 46 

that arise outside of the ordinary course of our business), fees for financial transactions, such as secondary public offering expenses for which we do not receive proceeds (including bonuses paid to executives related to completion of such transactions) and other contemplated corporate transactions, expense related to the remeasurement of our TRA obligation, expense related to loss on impairment or write down of goodwill and other assets, loss on brand divestitures and wind down, executive transition costs (consisting of costs associated with the transition of our former CEO, such as professional services, legal fees, executive recruiting costs and other related costs), one-time costs associated with rebranding one studio to the KINRGY brand, and restructuring and related charges incurred in connection with our restructuring plan that we do not believe reflect our underlying business performance and affect comparability. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are also frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. 
 We believe that adjusted EBITDA, viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, our reported GAAP results, provides useful information to investors regarding our performance and overall results of operations because it eliminates the impact of other items that we believe reduce the comparability of our underlying core business performance from period to period and is therefore useful to our investors in comparing the core performance of our business from period to period. 
 The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 As of September 30, 2024, we had 24.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, excluding 13.0 million of restricted cash consisting of marketing fund restricted cash and a guarantee of standby letter of credit. 
 We require cash principally to fund day-to-day operations, finance capital investments, service our outstanding debt and address our working capital needs. Based on our current level of operations and anticipated growth, we believe that our available cash balance and the cash generated from our operations will be adequate to meet our anticipated debt service requirements and obligations under our TRA, capital expenditures, payment of tax distributions and working capital needs for at least the next twelve months. Our ability to continue to fund these items and continue to reduce debt could be adversely affected by the occurrence of any of the events described under Risk Factors , as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There can be no assurance, however, that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under our credit facility or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness, including our credit facility, or to make anticipated capital expenditures. Our future operating performance and our ability to service, extend or refinance the credit facility will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. 
 Credit Facility 
 On April 19, 2021, we entered into a Financing Agreement with Wilmington Trust, National Association, as administrative agent and collateral agent, and the lenders party thereto (the Credit Agreement ), which consists of a 212 million senior secured term loan 
 47 

facility (the Term Loan Facility , and the loans thereunder, each a Term Loan and together, the Term Loans ). Affiliates of the lenders also separately purchased 200,000 shares of our 6.50 Series A Convertible Preferred Stock for 200 million. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Xponential Intermediate Holdings, LLC and certain of our material subsidiaries, and are secured by substantially all of the assets of Xponential Intermediate Holdings, LLC and certain of our material subsidiaries. 
 The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among other things: (i) to maintain certain total leverage ratios, liquidity levels and EBITDA levels (in each case, as discussed further in the Credit Agreement); (ii) to use the proceeds of borrowings only for certain specified purposes; (iii) to refrain from entering into certain agreements outside of the ordinary course of business, including with respect to consolidation or mergers; (iv) restricting further indebtedness or liens; (v) restricting certain transactions with our affiliates; (vi) restricting investments; (vii) restricting prepayments of subordinated indebtedness; (viii) restricting certain payments, including certain payments to our affiliates or equity holders and distributions to equity holders; and (ix) restricting the issuance of equity. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with these covenants. 
 On February 13, 2024, we entered into a sixth amendment (the Sixth Amendment to the Credit Agreement. The Sixth Amendment provides for, among other things, additional term loans in an aggregate principal amount of approximately 38.7 million, with an original issue discount of 4.1 million, (the Sixth Amendment Incremental Term Loans ). The original issue discount was paid-in-kind by increasing the principal amount of the Credit Agreement. The proceeds of the Sixth Amendment were used to repay an aggregate of 38.7 million in existing term loans under the Credit Agreement and for the payment of fees, costs and expenses related to the making of the Sixth Amendment Incremental Term Loans. The Sixth Amendment, among other things, also (i) increased the amount of the quarterly principal payments of the loans provided pursuant to the Credit Agreement (including the Sixth Amendment Incremental Term Loans) commencing on June 30, 2024 to 1.3 million, (ii) included a prepayment premium on the Sixth Amendment Incremental Term Loans and (iii) extended the maturity date for all outstanding term loans under the Credit Agreement to March 15, 2026. 
 On August 23, 2024, we entered into a seventh amendment (the Seventh Amendment to the Credit Agreement. The Seventh Amendment provides for, among other things, additional term loans in an aggregate principal amount of 25.0 million, with an original issue discount of 0.8 million, (the Seventh Amendment Incremental Term Loans ). The proceeds of which will be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital, lease liabilities, and legal expenses arising from previously disclosed regulatory matters. The Seventh Amendment, among other things, also increased the amount of the quarterly principal payments of the loans provided pursuant to the Credit Agreement (including the Seventh Amendment Incremental Term Loans) commencing on September 30, 2024 to 1.3 million and included a prepayment premium on the Seventh Amendment Incremental Term Loans. 
 The total principal amount outstanding on the Term Loans was 353.8 million at September 30, 2024. See Note 8 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our debt. 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 At September 30, 2024, there had been no material changes in our cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations as disclosed in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by operating activities was 10.9 million, compared to 38.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease in cash provided of 27.3 million. Of the decrease, 26.4 million was due to lower net income after adjustments to reconcile net income (loss) to net cash provided by operating activities and 0.9 million in unfavorable changes in working capital related to deferred revenue, accounts payable, and other liabilities, partially offset by favorable changes in working capital related to prepaid expenses and other current assets, deferred costs, inventories, accounts receivable, accrued 
 48 

expenses, and operating lease liabilities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cash used in investing activities was 13.9 million and 8.6 million, respectively. The change year over year in cash used of 5.3 million was primarily attributable to cash used of 8.5 million for our acquisition of Lindora; partially offset by decreases in cash used to purchase property and equipment and intangible assets of 1.3 million and 1.0 million, respectively. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by financing activities was 3.7 million, compared to cash used in financing activities of 15.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease in cash used of 18.8 million. The decrease in cash used was primarily attributable to prior year payments of 130.8 million related to repurchase of convertible preferred stock, 50.4 million for share repurchases, 8.1 million payment for taxes on net share settlements, and a 4.4 million loan to a shareholder compared to no similar payments in the current year. The decrease in cash used was partially offset by net borrowings on long-term debt of 186.1 million and a payment received from a shareholder of 8.1 million in the prior year compared to net borrowings on long-term debt of 20.4 million in the current year. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024, our off-balance sheet arrangements consisted of guarantees of lease agreements for certain franchisees. Our maximum total commitment under these agreements is approximately 1.8 million and would only require payment upon default by the primary obligor. We determined the fair value of these guarantees at inception was not material, and as of September 30, 2024 a 0.8 million accrual has been recorded for our potential obligation under the guaranty arrangements. See Note 16 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding these operating leases and guarantees.
 
 In July 2022, we issued a standby letter of credit to a third-party financing company, who provides loans to our qualified franchisees. The standby letter of credit is contingent upon the failure of our franchisees to perform according to the terms of underlying contracts with the third party. We deposited cash in a restricted account as collateral for the standby letter of credit. The estimated fair value of these guarantees at inception was not material, and as of September 30, 2024 a 0.3 million accrual has been recorded for our potential obligation under this guaranty arrangement. See Note 16 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from the information provided in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Item 3 . Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Market risk represents the risk to our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily due to potential interest rate risk and potential increases in inflation. We do not hold financial instruments for trading purposes. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of the outstanding balance under our Credit Agreement. Our primary exposure is an increase in SOFR, which increases the interest rate we pay on the outstanding principal balance of our debt. The nature and amount of our long-term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. Any increases in our outstanding indebtedness will amplify the effects of increased interest rates. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding principal balance of 353.8 million on the Credit Agreement was subject to variable interest rates. Based upon a sensitivity analysis, a hypothetical 1 change in interest rates on our debt outstanding would change our annual interest expense by approximately 3.5 million. 
 Inflation Risk 
 The inflation rate has been falling after reaching a nearly three decade high in 2022. Although inflation has decreased, interest rates remain high and may continue to increase our interest expense and our operating costs as well as the operating costs of our franchisees. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, there can be no assurance that future inflation will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition. 
 Item 4 . Controls and Procedures. 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

If the Administrative Agent does not receive timely notice of the Interest Period elected by the Administrative Borrower, the Administrative Borrower shall be deemed to have elected to convert such SOFR Loan to a Reference Rate Loan. 
 (c)	The Administrative Borrower may, on any Business Day of the then current Interest Period applicable to any outstanding SOFR Loan, or on any Business Day with respect to Reference Rate Loans, convert any such loan into a loan of another type of loan i.e. , a Reference Rate Loan or a SOFR Loan) in the same aggregate principal amount, provided that any conversion 
 70 #97889170v9	 #98823282v3	 

of a SOFR Loan not made on the last Business Day of the then current Interest Period applicable to such SOFR Loan shall be subject to Section 2.09(e) . If a Borrower desires to convert a Loan, such Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a SOFR Notice by no later than 1:00 p.m. (New York time) (i) on the day which is three (3) Business Days prior to the date on which such conversion is to occur with respect to a conversion from a Reference Rate Loan to a SOFR Loan, or (ii) on the day which is one (1) Business Day prior to the date on which such conversion is to occur with respect to a conversion from a SOFR Loan to a Reference Rate Loan, specifying, in each case, the date of such conversion, the Loans to be converted and if the conversion is from a Reference Rate Loan to a SOFR Loan, the duration of the first Interest Period therefor. 
 (d)	In the event that any prepayment of a SOFR Loan is required or permitted on a date other than the last Business Day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto, the Borrowers shall, jointly and severally, indemnify the Administrative Agent and Lenders therefor in accordance with Section 2.09(e) . 
 (e)	The Borrowers shall, jointly and severally, indemnify the Agents and Lenders and hold the Agents and Lenders harmless from and against any and all losses, costs or expenses, excluding the loss of any margin above the Adjusted Term SOFR (such losses, costs and expenses, collectively, Funding Losses ), that the Agents and Lenders may sustain or incur as a consequence of any mandatory or voluntary prepayment, conversion of or any default by the Borrowers in the payment of the principal of or interest on any SOFR Loan or failure by the Borrowers to complete a borrowing of, a prepayment of or conversion of or to a SOFR Loan after notice thereof has been given, including, but not limited to, any interest, excluding the loss of any margin above the Adjusted Term SOFR, payable by the Agents or Lenders to lenders of funds obtained by it in order to make or maintain its SOFR Loans hereunder (it being agreed that the Agents and Lenders shall be entitled to such indemnification on such basis whether or not they have obtained such funds to make or maintain its SOFR Loans hereunder, to be calculated in accordance with customary banking practices). A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to the foregoing sentence submitted by any Agent or any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) to the Borrowers shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
 (f)	Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable lending office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to SOFR, the Term SOFR Reference Rate, Adjusted Term SOFR or Term SOFR, or to determine or charge interest based upon SOFR, the Term SOFR Reference Rate, Adjusted Term SOFR or Term SOFR, then, upon notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower (through the Administrative Agent) (an Illegality Notice ), (a) any obligation of the Lenders to make SOFR Loans, and any right of the Borrower to continue SOFR Loans or to convert Reference Rate Loans to SOFR Loans, shall be suspended, and (b) the interest rate on which Reference Rate Loans shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to clause (c) of the definition of Reference Rate , in each case until each affected Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of an Illegality Notice, the Borrower shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, upon demand from any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all SOFR Loans to Reference Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Reference Rate Loans shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be 
 71 #97889170v9	 #98823282v3	 

determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to clause (c) of the definition of Reference Rate ), on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if all affected Lenders may lawfully continue to maintain such SOFR Loans to such day, or immediately, if any Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such SOFR Loans to such day. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 2.09. 
 (g)	Subject to Section 2.09 , if, on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period for any SOFR Loan: 
 (i)	the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that Adjusted Term SOFR cannot be determined pursuant to the definition thereof, or 
 (ii)	the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a SOFR Loan or a conversion thereto or a continuation thereof that Adjusted Term SOFR for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed SOFR Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making and maintaining such Loan, and the Required Lenders have provided notice of such determination to the Administrative Agent, 
 then, in each case, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. 
 Upon notice thereof by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower, any obligation of the Lenders to make SOFR Loans, and any right of the Borrower to continue SOFR Loans or to convert Reference Rate Loans to SOFR Loans, shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected SOFR Loans or affected Interest Periods) until the Administrative Agent (with respect to clause (b), at the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, (i) the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of SOFR Loans (to the extent of the affected SOFR Loans or affected Interest Periods) or, failing that, the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a Borrowing of or conversion to Reference Rate Loans in the amount specified therein and (ii) any outstanding affected SOFR Loans will be deemed to have been converted into Reference Rate Loans at the end of the applicable Interest Period. Upon any such conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to this Agreement. Subject to Section 2.09 , if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that Adjusted Term SOFR cannot be determined pursuant to the definition thereof on any given day, the interest rate on Reference Rate Loans shall be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to clause (c) of the definition of Reference Rate until the Administrative Agent revokes such determination. 
 (h)	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, the Administrative Agent (acting at the direction, or with the consent, of the Required Lenders) and the Borrower may amend this Agreement to replace the then-current Benchmark with a Benchmark Replacement. The Lenders hereby (i) authorize and direct the Administrative Agent to implement any Benchmark 
 72 #97889170v9	 #98823282v3	 

Replacement that has been consented or agreed to by the Required Lenders, or in respect of which the Administrative Agent has received a direction from the Required Lenders to implement and (ii) acknowledge and agree that the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to all of the exculpations, protections and indemnifications provided for in this Agreement in favor of the Administrative Agent in implementing any Benchmark Replacement that has been consented or agreed to by the Required Lenders, or in respect of which the Administrative Agent has received a direction from the Required Lenders to implement. Any such amendment with respect to a Benchmark Transition Event will become effective at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the Administrative Agent has posted such proposed amendment to all affected Lenders and the Borrower so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such amendment from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders. No replacement of a Benchmark with a Benchmark Replacement pursuant to this Section 2.09(h) will occur prior to the applicable Benchmark Transition Start Date. 
 (i)	In connection with the use, administration, adoption or implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, the Administrative Agent (acting at the direction of the Required Lenders) will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document(and the Lenders hereby (i) authorize and direct the Administrative Agent to make any Conforming Changes (and to enter into any modifications to this Agreement or other Loan Documents implementing such Conforming Changes) that have been consented or agreed to by the Required Lenders, or in respect of which the Administrative Agent has received a direction from the Required Lenders to implement and (ii) acknowledge and agree that the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to all of the exculpations, protections and indemnifications provided for in this Agreement in favor of the Administrative Agent in implementing any Conforming Changes (or in entering into any modifications to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents implementing the same) that have been consented or agreed to by the Required Lenders, or in respect of which the Administrative Agent has received a direction from the Required Lenders to implement); provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to enter into any Conforming Changes amendment that affect the rights, duties, liabilities, indemnities or immunities of the Administrative Agent. 
 (j)	The Administrative Agent will notify the Borrower and the Lenders of (i) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement and (ii) the effectiveness of any Conforming Changes in connection with the use, administration, adoption or implementation of a Benchmark Replacement. The Administrative Agent will notify the Borrower of (x) the removal or reinstatement of any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to Section 2.09(k) and (v) the commencement of any Benchmark Unavailability Period. Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Administrative Agent (whether at the direction of the Required Lenders or otherwise) or, if applicable, any Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this Section 2.09 , including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 2.09 . 
 73 #97889170v9	 #98823282v3	 

(k)	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including Term SOFR Reference Rate) and either (A) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or (B) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is not or will not be representative, then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period (or any similar or analogous definition) for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and (ii) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (i) above either (A) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is not or will not be representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period (or any similar or analogous definition) for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor. 
 (l)	Upon the Borrower s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, (i) the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of SOFR Loans to be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a Borrowing of or conversion to Reference Rate Loans and (ii) any outstanding affected SOFR Loans will be deemed to have been converted to Reference Rate Loans at the end of the applicable Interest Period. During a Benchmark Unavailability Period or at any time that a tenor for the then-current Benchmark is not an Available Tenor, the component of Reference Rate based upon the then-current Benchmark or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any determination of Reference Rate.

 ARTICLE V PAYMENTS AND OTHER COMPENSATION 
 Section 5.01	[ Intentionally Omitted ]. 
 Section 5.02	 Payments; Computations and Statements . (a) The Borrowers will make each payment under this Agreement not later than 1:00 p.m. (New York time) on the day when due, in lawful money of the United States of America and in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent s Account. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 1:00 p.m. (New York time) on any Business Day shall, in the Administrative Agent s discretion, be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. The Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like 
 74 #97889170v9	 #98823282v3	 

funds relating to the payment of principal and interest ratably to the Lenders in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Lender to such Lender, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. All payments shall be made by the Borrowers without set-off, counterclaim, deduction or other defense to the Agents and the Lenders. Whenever any payment to be made under any such Loan Document shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of interest or fees, as the case may be; provided, however, that if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of SOFR Loans to be made in the next succeeding calendar month, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day. All computations of fees shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such fees are payable. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fees hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes in the absence of manifest error. 
 (b)	Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Administrative Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrowers will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrowers have made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the applicable Lenders, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrowers did not in fact make such payment, then each of the applicable Lenders, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed by the Administrative Agent to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any reasonable administrative, processing, or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing. 
 
 Section 5.03	 Sharing of Payments, Defaulting Lenders, Etc. . 
 (a)	The Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to transfer to a Defaulting Lender any payments made by any Borrower to the Administrative Agent for the Defaulting Lender s benefit, and, in the absence of such transfer to the Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent shall transfer any such payments to each other non-Defaulting Lender ratably in accordance with their Commitments (but only to the extent that such Defaulting Lender s Loan was funded by the other Lenders) or, if so directed by the Borrowers and if no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (and to the extent such Defaulting Lender s Loan was not funded by the other Lenders), retain the same to be re-advanced to the Borrowers as if such Defaulting Lender had made such Loans to the Borrowers. Subject to the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may hold and, in its discretion, re-lend to the Borrowers for the account of such Defaulting Lender the amount of all such payments received and retained by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender. This Section shall remain effective with respect to such Lender until (x) the Obligations (other than unasserted contingent indemnification Obligations) under this Agreement shall have been declared or shall have become 
 75 #97889170v9	 #98823282v3	 

immediately due and payable, (y) the non-Defaulting Lenders, the Administrative Agent, and the Borrowers shall have waived such Defaulting Lender s default in writing, or (z) the Defaulting Lender makes its Pro Rata Share of the applicable defaulted Loan and pays to the Administrative Agent all amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender in respect thereof. The operation of this Section shall not be construed to increase or otherwise affect the Commitment of any Lender, to relieve or excuse the performance by such Defaulting Lender or any other Lender of its duties and obligations hereunder, or to relieve or excuse the performance by the Borrowers of its duties and obligations hereunder to the Administrative Agent or to the Lenders other than such Defaulting Lender. Any such failure to fund by any Defaulting Lender shall constitute a material breach by such Defaulting Lender of this Agreement and shall entitle the Borrowers at their option, subject to the written consent of the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), to permanently replace the Defaulting Lender with one or more substitute Lenders (each, a Replacement Lender ), and the Defaulting Lender shall have no right to refuse to be replaced hereunder. Notice from the Borrowers to the Agents effecting their right to replace the Defaulting Lender shall specify an effective date for such replacement, which date shall not be later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the date such notice is given. Prior to the effective date of such replacement, the Defaulting Lender and each Replacement Lender shall execute and deliver an Assignment and Acceptance, subject only to the Defaulting Lender being repaid its share of the outstanding Obligations without any premium or penalty of any kind whatsoever. If the Defaulting Lender shall refuse or fail to execute and deliver any such Assignment and Acceptance prior to the effective date of such replacement, the Defaulting Lender shall be deemed to have executed and delivered such Assignment and Acceptance. The replacement of any Defaulting Lender shall be made in accordance with the terms of Section 12.07(b) . Any such assumption of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any of the Lenders or the Borrowers rights or remedies against any such Defaulting Lender arising out of or in relation to such failure to fund. 
 (b)	Except as provided in Section 2.02 or Section 12.07 , if any Lender shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of any Obligation in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of similar obligations obtained by all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in such similar obligations held by them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided , however , that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender s ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender of any interest or other amount paid by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered); provided , the provisions of this Section 4.03(b) shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by or on behalf of any Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (including, without limitation, as provided in Section 2.05 and the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender) The Borrowers agree that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 4.03(b) may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all of its rights (including the Lender s right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrowers in the amount of such participation.

Section 5.04	Apportionment of Payments . Subject to Section 2.02 or Section 12.07 hereof and to any written agreement among the Agents and/or the Lenders: 
 (a)	all payments of principal and interest in respect of outstanding Loans, all payments of fees (other than the fees set forth in Sections 2.06 and 7.01(f) hereof) and all other payments in respect of any other Obligations, shall be allocated by the Administrative Agent among such of the Lenders as are entitled thereto, in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Shares or otherwise as provided herein or, in respect of payments not made on account of Loans, as designated by the Person making payment when the payment is made. 
 (b)	After the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent may, and upon the direction of the Required Lenders shall (or in the case of an acceleration of the Obligations, the Administrative Agent shall), apply all proceeds of the Collateral and all amounts received by the Administrative Agent on account of the Obligations (i) first , ratably to pay the Obligations in respect of any fees, expense reimbursements, indemnities and other amounts then due and payable to the Agents until paid in full; (ii) second , [reserved]; (iii) third , [reserved]; (iv) fourth , ratably to pay the Obligations in respect of any fees (other than any Applicable Prepayment Premium) and indemnities then due and payable to the Lenders until paid in full; (v) fifth , ratably to pay interest then due and payable in respect of the Loans until paid in full; (vi) sixth , ratably to pay principal of the Loans until paid in full; (vii) seventh , ratably to pay the Obligations in respect of any Applicable Prepayment Premium then due and payable to the Lenders until paid in full; and (viii) eighth , to the ratable payment of all other Obligations then due and payable. 
 (c)	In each instance, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Section 4.04(b) shall not be deemed to apply to any payment by the Borrowers specified by the Administrative Borrower to the Administrative Agent to be for the payment of Term Loan Obligations then due and payable under any provision of this Agreement or the prepayment of all or part of the principal of the Term Loans in accordance with the terms and conditions of Section 2.05 . 
 (d)	For purposes of Section 4.04(b) , (other than clause (vi )), paid in full means payment in cash of all amounts owing under the Loan Documents according to the terms thereof, including loan fees, service fees, professional fees, interest (and specifically including interest accrued after the commencement of any Insolvency Proceeding), default interest, interest on interest, and expense reimbursements, whether or not same would be or is allowed or disallowed in whole or in part in any Insolvency Proceeding, except to the extent that default or overdue interest (but not any other interest) and loan fees, each arising from or related to a default, are disallowed in any Insolvency Proceeding; provided , however , that for the purposes of clause (vi) , paid in full means payment in cash of all amounts owing under the Loan Documents according to the terms thereof, including loan fees, service fees, professional fees, interest (and specifically including interest accrued after the commencement of any Insolvency Proceeding), default interest, interest on interest, and expense reimbursements, whether or not the same would be or is allowed or disallowed in whole or in part in any Insolvency Proceeding. 
 (e)	In the event of a direct conflict between the priority provisions of this Section 4.04 and other provisions contained in any other Loan Document, it is the intention of 
 77 #97889170v9	 #98823282v3	 

the parties hereto that both such priority provisions in such documents shall be read together and construed, to the fullest extent possible, to be in concert with each other. In the event of any actual, irreconcilable conflict that cannot be resolved as aforesaid, the terms and provisions of this Section 4.04 shall control and govern. 
 Section 5.05	 Increased Costs and Reduced Return . (a) If any Lender or any Agent shall have determined that a Change in Law, shall (i) subject such Agent or such Lender, or any Person controlling such Agent or such Lender, to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto, (ii) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against any Loan or against assets of or held by, or deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, such Agent or such Lender or any Person controlling such Agent or such Lender or (iii) impose on such Agent or such Lender or any Person controlling such Agent or such Lender any other condition regarding this Agreement or any Loan, and the result of any event referred to in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) above shall be to increase the cost to such Agent or such Lender of making any Loan, or agreeing to make any Loan, or to reduce any amount received or receivable by such Agent or such Lender hereunder, then, within twenty (20) days after receipt by the Administrative Borrower from such Agent or such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of the certificate required under Section 4.05(c), the Borrowers shall pay to such Agent or such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Agent or such Lender for such increased costs or reductions in amounts received or receivable. 
 (b)	If any Agent or any Lender shall have determined that any Change in Law either (i) affects or would affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Agent or such Lender or any Person controlling such Agent or such Lender, and such Agent or such Lender determines that the amount of such capital is increased as a direct or indirect consequence of any Loans made or maintained, such Agent s or such Lender s or such other controlling Person s other obligations hereunder, or (ii) has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Agent s or such Lender s or such other controlling Person s capital to a level below that which such Agent or such Lender or such controlling Person could have achieved but for such circumstances as a consequence of any Loans made or maintained, or any guaranty or participation with respect thereto or any agreement to make Loans, or such Agent s, or such Lender s or such other controlling Person s other obligations hereunder (in each case, taking into consideration, such Agent s or such Lender s or such other controlling Person s policies with respect to capital adequacy), then, within twenty (20) days after receipt by the Administrative Borrower from such Agent or such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of the certificate required under Section 4.05(c) , the Borrowers shall pay to such Agent or such Lender for such cost of maintaining such increased capital or such reduction in the rate of return on such Agent s or such Lender s or such other controlling Person s capital. 
 (c)	All amounts payable under this Section 4.05 shall bear interest from the date that is twenty (20) days after the date of demand by any Agent or any Lender until payment in full to such Agent or such Lender at the Reference Rate. A certificate of such Agent or such Lender claiming compensation under this Section 4.05 , specifying the event herein above described and the nature of such event shall be submitted by such Agent or such Lender (with a copy to the 
 78 #97889170v9	 #98823282v3	 

Administrative Agent) to the Administrative Borrower, setting forth the additional amount due and an explanation of the calculation thereof in reasonable detail, and such Agent s or such Lender s reasons for invoking the provisions of this Section 4.05 , and shall be final and conclusive absent manifest error; provided that any such certificate claiming amounts described in clause (i) or (ii) of the proviso set forth in the definition of Change in Law shall, in addition, state the basis upon which such amount has been calculated and certify that such Agent s or Lender s method of allocating such costs is fair and reasonable and that such Agent s or Lender s demand for payment of such costs hereunder, and such method of allocation, is not inconsistent with its treatment of other borrowers which, as a credit matter, are substantially similar to the Borrowers and which are subject to similar provisions. 
 (d)	If any Lender or Agent becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall promptly notify the Loan Parties of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled; provided that the Loan Parties shall not be required to compensate a Lender or Agent pursuant to this paragraph for any amounts incurred more than six months prior to the date that such Lender or Agent notifies the Loan Parties of such Lender s or Agent s intention to claim compensation therefor in accordance with Section 4.05(c) ; provided further that, if the circumstances giving rise to such claim have a retroactive effect, then such six month period shall be extended to include the period of such retroactive effect. 
 (e)	If any Lender or Agent requests compensation or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or Agent or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional interest or other amount to any Lender or Agent hereunder, then such Lender or Agent shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender or Agent such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable hereunder in the future, (ii) would not subject such Lender or Agent to any unreimbursed cost or expense, and (iii) would not otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender or Agent. 
 Section 5.06	 Joint and Several Liability of the Borrowers . (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any other Loan Document to the contrary, each of the Borrowers hereby accepts joint and several liability hereunder and under the other Loan Documents in consideration of the financial accommodations to be provided by the Agents and the Lenders under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, for the mutual benefit, directly and indirectly, of each of the Borrowers and in consideration of the undertakings of the other Borrowers to accept joint and several liability for the Obligations. Each of the Borrowers, jointly and severally, hereby irrevocably and unconditionally accepts, not merely as a surety but also as a co-debtor, joint and several liability with the other Borrowers, with respect to the payment and performance of all of the Obligations (including, without limitation, any Obligations arising under this Section 4.06 ), it being the intention of the parties hereto that all of the Obligations shall be the joint and several obligations of each of the Borrowers without preferences or distinction among them. If and to the extent that any of the Borrowers shall fail to make any payment with respect to any of the Obligations as and when due or to perform any of the Obligations in accordance with the terms thereof, then in each such event, the other Borrowers will make such payment with respect to, or perform, such Obligation. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Obligations of each of the Borrowers under the provisions of this Section 4.06 constitute the absolute and unconditional, 
 79 #97889170v9	 #98823282v3	 

full recourse Obligations of each of the Borrowers, enforceable against each such Person to the full extent of its properties and assets, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or any other circumstances whatsoever. 
 (b)	The provisions of this Section 4.06 are made for the benefit of the Agents, the Lenders and their successors and assigns, and may be enforced by them from time to time against any or all of the Borrowers as often as occasion therefor may arise and without requirement on the part of the Agents, the Lenders or such successors or assigns first to marshal any of its or their claims or to exercise any of its or their rights against any of the other Borrowers or to exhaust any remedies available to it or them against any of the other Borrowers or to resort to any other source or means of obtaining payment of any of the Obligations hereunder or to elect any other remedy.

 Section 13.18	 Binding Effect . This Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by each Loan Party, each Agent and each Lender and when the conditions precedent set forth in Section 5.01 hereof have been satisfied or waived in writing by the Agents, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each Loan Party, each Agent and each Lender, and their respective successors and assigns, except that the Loan Parties shall not have the right to assign their rights hereunder or any interest herein without the prior written consent of each Agent and each Lender, and any assignment by any Lender shall be governed by Section 12.07 hereof. 
 Section 13.19	 Interest . It is the intention of the parties hereto that each Agent and each Lender shall conform strictly to usury laws applicable to it.

 151 #97889170v9	 #98823282v3	 

agreement entered into in connection with or as security for the Obligations, it is agreed as follows: (i) the aggregate of all consideration which constitutes interest under law applicable to any Agent or any Lender that is contracted for, taken, reserved, charged or received by such Agent or such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document or agreements or otherwise in connection with the Obligations shall under no circumstances exceed the maximum amount allowed by such applicable law, any excess shall be canceled automatically and if theretofore paid shall be credited by such Agent or such Lender on the principal amount of the Obligations (or, to the extent that the principal amount of the Obligations shall have been or would thereby be paid in full, refunded by such Agent or such Lender, as applicable, to the Borrowers); and (ii) in the event that the maturity of the Obligations is accelerated by reason of any Event of Default under this Agreement or otherwise, or in the event of any required or permitted prepayment, then such consideration that constitutes interest under law applicable to any Agent or any Lender may never include more than the maximum amount allowed by such applicable law, and excess interest, if any, provided for in this Agreement or otherwise shall be canceled automatically by such Agent or such Lender, as applicable, as of the date of such acceleration or prepayment and, if theretofore paid, shall be credited by such Agent or such Lender, as applicable, on the principal amount of the Obligations (or, to the extent that the principal amount of the Obligations shall have been or would thereby be paid in full, refunded by such Agent or such Lender to the Borrowers). All sums paid or agreed to be paid to any Agent or any Lender for the use, forbearance or detention of sums due hereunder shall, to the extent permitted by law applicable to such Agent or such Lender, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread throughout the full term of the Loans until payment in full so that the rate or amount of interest on account of any Loans hereunder does not exceed the maximum amount allowed by such applicable law. If at any time and from time to time (x) the amount of interest payable to any Agent or any Lender on any date shall be computed at the Highest Lawful Rate applicable to such Agent or such Lender pursuant to this Section 12.19 and (y) in respect of any subsequent interest computation period the amount of interest otherwise payable to such Agent or such Lender would be less than the amount of interest payable to such Agent or such Lender computed at the Highest Lawful Rate applicable to such Agent or such Lender, then the amount of interest payable to such Agent or such Lender in respect of such subsequent interest computation period shall continue to be computed at the Highest Lawful Rate applicable to such Agent or such Lender until the total amount of interest payable to such Agent or such Lender shall equal the total amount of interest which would have been payable to such Agent or such Lender if the total amount of interest had been computed without giving effect to this Section 12.19 . 
 For purposes of this Section 12.19 , the term applicable law shall mean that law in effect from time to time and applicable to the loan transaction between the Borrowers, on the one hand, and the Agents and the Lenders, on the other, that lawfully permits the charging and collection of the highest permissible, lawful non-usurious rate of interest on such loan transaction and this Agreement, including laws of the State of New York and, to the extent controlling, laws of the United States of America. 
 The right to accelerate the maturity of the Obligations does not include the right to accelerate any interest that has not accrued as of the date of acceleration.
