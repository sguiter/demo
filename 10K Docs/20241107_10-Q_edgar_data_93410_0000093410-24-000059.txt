CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS RELEVANT TO FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION 
 FOR THE PURPOSE OF SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE 
 PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 
 This quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Chevron Corporation contains forward-looking statements relating to Chevron s operations and lower carbon strategy that are based on management s current expectations, estimates, and projections about the petroleum, chemicals, and other energy-related industries. Words or phrases such as anticipates, expects, intends, plans, targets, advances, commits, drives, aims, forecasts, projects, believes, approaches, seeks, schedules, estimates, positions, pursues, progress, may, can, could, should, will, budgets, outlook, trends, guidance, focus, on track, goals, objectives, strategies, opportunities, poised, potential, ambitions, aspires and similar expressions, and variations or negatives of these words, are intended to identify such forward-looking statements, but not all forward-looking statements include such words. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond the company s control and are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. The reader should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. Unless legally required, Chevron undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 
 Among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are: changing crude oil and natural gas prices and demand for the company s products, and production curtailments due to market conditions; crude oil production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producing countries; technological advancements; changes to government policies in the countries in which the company operates; public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, and any related government policies and actions; disruptions in the company s global supply chain, including supply chain constraints and escalation of the cost of goods and services; changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which the company operates; general domestic and international economic, market and political conditions, including the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the conflict in Israel and the global response to these hostilities; changing refining, marketing and chemicals margins; the company s ability to realize anticipated cost savings and efficiencies associated with enterprise structural cost reduction initiatives; actions of competitors or regulators; timing of exploration expenses; timing of crude oil liftings; the competitiveness of alternate-energy sources or product substitutes; development of large carbon capture and offset markets; the results of operations and financial condition of the company s suppliers, vendors, partners and equity affiliates; the inability or failure of the company s joint-venture partners to fund their share of operations and development activities; the potential failure to achieve expected net production from existing and future crude oil and natural gas development projects; potential delays in the development, construction or start-up of planned projects; the potential disruption or interruption of the company s operations due to war, accidents, political events, civil unrest, severe weather, cyber threats, terrorist acts, or other natural or human causes beyond the company s control; the potential liability for remedial actions or assessments under existing or future environmental regulations and litigation; significant operational, investment or product changes undertaken or required by existing or future environmental statutes and regulations, including international agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change; the potential liability resulting from pending or future litigation; the risk that regulatory approvals and clearances related to the Hess Corporation (Hess) transaction are not obtained or are obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated by the company and Hess; potential delays in consummating the Hess transaction, including as a result of the ongoing arbitration proceedings regarding preemptive rights in the Stabroek Block joint operating agreement; risks that such ongoing arbitration is not satisfactorily resolved and the potential transaction fails to be consummated; uncertainties as to whether the potential transaction, if consummated, will achieve its anticipated economic benefits, including as a result of risks associated with third party contracts containing material consent, anti-assignment, transfer or other provisions that may be related to the potential transaction that are not waived or otherwise satisfactorily resolved; the company s ability to integrate Hess operations in a successful manner and in the expected time period; the possibility that any of the anticipated benefits and projected synergies of the potential transaction will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period; the company s future acquisitions or dispositions of assets or shares or the delay or failure of such transactions to close based on required closing conditions; the potential for gains and losses from asset dispositions or impairments; government mandated sales, divestitures, recapitalizations, taxes and tax audits, tariffs, sanctions, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on scope of company operations; foreign currency movements compared with the U.S. dollar; higher inflation and related impacts; material reductions in corporate liquidity and access to debt markets; changes to the company s capital allocation strategies; the effects of changed accounting rules under generally accepted accounting principles promulgated by rule-setting bodies; the company s ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent in operating in the global energy industry; and the factors set forth under the heading Risk Factors on pages 20 through 26 of the company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in subsequent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Other unpredictable or unknown factors not discussed in this report could also have material adverse effects on forward-looking statements.

 Through September 30, 2024, a total of million was contributed to employee pension plans (including million to the U.S. plans). Contribution amounts are dependent upon plan investment returns, changes in pension obligations, regulatory requirements and other economic factors.

 million between quarterly periods from billion in 2023 to billion in 2024. The company s income before income tax expense decreased 2.2 billion from billion in 2023 to billion in 2024, primarily due to lower downstream margins, lower upstream realizations, unfavorable foreign currency effects and higher upstream depreciation, depletion and amortization, partially offset by higher upstream sales volumes. The company s effective tax rate increased between quarterly periods from percent in 2023 to percent in 2024. The change in effective tax rate was primarily due to the absence of prior period favorable tax items and mix effects, resulting from the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arose in higher or lower tax rate jurisdictions.

 separate lawsuits filed by various U.S. cities and counties, U.S. states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Native American tribes, and a trade group in both federal and state courts. 1 The lawsuits have asserted various causes of action, including public nuisance, private nuisance, failure to warn, fraud, conspiracy to commit fraud, design defect, product defect, trespass, negligence, impairment of public trust, equitable relief for pollution, impairment and destruction of natural resources, unjust enrichment, violations of consumer and environmental protection statutes, violations of unfair competition statutes, violations of a federal antitrust statute, and violations of federal and state RICO statutes, based upon, among other things, the company s production of oil and gas products and alleged misrepresentations or omissions relating to climate change risks associated with those products. Further such proceedings are likely to be brought by other parties. While defendants have sought to remove cases filed in state court to federal court, most of those cases have been remanded to state court and the U.S. Supreme Court has denied petitions for writ of certiorari on jurisdictional questions to date. The unprecedented legal theories set forth in these proceedings include claims for damages (both compensatory and punitive), injunctive and other forms of equitable relief, including without limitation abatement, contribution to abatement funds, disgorgement of profits and equitable relief for pollution, impairment and destruction of natural resources, civil penalties and liability for fees and costs of suits. Due to the unprecedented nature of the suits, the company is unable to estimate any range of possible liability, but given the uncertainty of litigation there can be no assurance that the cases will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition.

 Derivatives - not designated Derivatives - designated Total Assets at Fair Value Derivatives - not designated Total Liabilities at Fair Value 
 Marketable Securities The company calculates fair value for its marketable securities based on quoted market prices for identical assets. The fair values reflect the cash that would have been received if the instruments were sold at September 30, 2024. 
 Derivatives The company records most of its derivative instruments other than any commodity derivative contracts that are accounted for as normal purchase and normal sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, with the offsetting amount to the Consolidated Statement of Income. The company designates certain derivative instruments as cash flow hedges that, if applicable, are reflected in the table above. Derivatives classified as Level 1 include futures, swaps and options contracts valued using quoted prices from active markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange. Derivatives classified as Level 2 include swaps, options and forward contracts, the fair values of which are obtained from third-party broker quotes, industry pricing services and exchanges. The company obtains multiple sources of pricing information for the Level 2 instruments. Since this pricing information is generated from observable market data, it has historically been very consistent. The company does not materially adjust this information. 
 Assets and liabilities carried at fair value at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, are as follows: 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents The company holds cash equivalents in U.S. and non-U.S. portfolios. The instruments classified as cash equivalents are primarily bank deposits with maturities of days or less, and money market funds. Cash and cash equivalents had carrying/fair values of billion and billion at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. The fair values of cash and cash equivalents are classified as Level 1 and reflect the cash that would have been received if the instruments were settled at September 30, 2024.

At September 30, 2024, restricted cash is classified as Level 1 and includes primarily restricted funds related to certain upstream decommissioning activities that are reported in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Deferred charges and other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 Long-Term Debt had a net carrying value, excluding amounts reclassified from short-term debt, purchase price fair value adjustments and finance lease obligations, of billion and billion at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. The fair value of these obligations was billion and billion at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively, and they primarily include corporate issued bonds. At September 30, 2024, the fair value of these obligations classified as Level 1 is billion and Level 2 is million. 
 The carrying values of other short-term financial assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet approximate their fair values. Fair value remeasurements of other financial instruments at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, were not material. 
 
 Investments and advances Total Assets at Fair Value 
 Properties, plant and equipment The company did not have any individually material impairments of long-lived assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis to report in third quarter 2024.

 The majority of the company s receivable balance is concentrated in trade receivables, with a balance of billion at September 30, 2024, which reflects the company s diversified sources of revenues and is dispersed across the company s broad worldwide customer base. As a result, the company believes the concentration of credit risk is limited. The company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers. When the financial strength of a customer is not considered sufficient, alternative risk mitigation measures may be deployed, including requiring prepayments, letters of credit or other acceptable forms of collateral. Once credit is extended and a receivable balance exists, the company applies a quantitative calculation to current trade receivable balances that reflects credit risk predictive analysis, including probability of default and loss given default, which takes into consideration current and forward-looking market data as well as the company s historical loss data. This statistical approach becomes the basis of the company s expected credit loss allowance for current trade receivables with payment terms that are typically short-term in nature, with most due in less than 90 days.

 billion, pursuant to which Hess stockholders will receive shares of Chevron common stock for each Hess share. The transaction was unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies. 
 On May 28, 2024, a majority of Hess stockholders voted to approve the merger. Following the Federal Trade Commission s (FTC) review of the transaction, on September 30, 2024, the FTC announced that a majority of the Commission voted to accept a consent agreement among the FTC, Chevron and Hess, resolving the concerns the FTC identified during its review of the transaction. Chevron and Hess haven taken and will continue to take appropriate steps to maintain our ability to close the merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act of 1976, as amended (HSR Act), following satisfactory resolution of the ongoing arbitration proceedings regarding preemptive rights in the Stabroek Block joint operating agreement, including filing additional notifications under the HSR Act. 
 The filing of the arbitration relating to the right of first refusal contained in an operating agreement among Hess Guyana Exploration Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Hess, affiliates of Exxon Mobil Corporation, and China National Offshore Oil Corporation may cause the transaction to be completed at a later time or to fail to be completed. The arbitration merits hearing about the applicability of the right of first refusal to the transaction has been scheduled for May 2025, with a decision expected in the following three months. 
 Chevron and Hess are working to complete the merger as soon as practicable. However, neither Chevron nor Hess can predict the actual date on which the transaction will be completed, if at all, because it is subject to conditions beyond each company s control. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of risks related to the Hess acquisition.

 Upstream earnings in third quarter 2024 were 4.6 billion compared with 5.8 billion in the corresponding 2023 period. The decrease was mainly due to the absence of prior year favorable foreign currency effects, absence of prior year favorable tax effects, and lower realizations, partially offset by higher sales volumes. Earnings for the first nine months of 2024 were 14.3 billion compared with 15.9 billion a year earlier. The decrease was mainly due to higher depreciation, depletion and amortization, an unfavorable swing in tax effects, negative foreign currency effects, and lower realizations, partially offset by higher sales volumes. 
 Downstream earnings in third quarter 2024 were 595 million compared with 1.7 billion in the corresponding 2023 period. The decrease was mainly due to lower margins on refined product sales. Earnings for the first nine months of 2024 were 2.0 billion compared with 5.0 billion a year earlier. The decrease was mainly due to lower margins on refined product sales and higher operating expenses.

Business Environment and Outlook 
 Chevron Corporation 3 is a global energy company with direct and indirect subsidiaries and affiliates that conduct substantial business activities in the following countries: Angola, Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, China, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Israel, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Nigeria, the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, the Philippines, the Republic of Congo, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Venezuela. 
 The company s objective is to safely deliver higher returns, lower carbon and superior shareholder value in any business environment. Earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream business segment. The most significant factor affecting the results of operations for the upstream segment is the price of crude oil, which is determined in global markets outside of the company s control. In the company s downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products. Periods of sustained lower commodity prices could result in the impairment or write-off of specific assets in future periods and cause the company to adjust operating expenses, including employee reductions, and capital expenditures, along with other measures intended to improve financial performance. 
 Governments, companies, communities, and other stakeholders are increasingly supporting efforts to address climate change. International initiatives and national, regional and state legislation and regulations that aim to directly or indirectly reduce GHG emissions are in various stages of design, adoption, and implementation. These policies and programs, some of which support the global net zero emissions ambitions of the Paris Agreement, can change the amount of energy consumed, the rate of energy-demand growth, the energy mix, and the relative economics of one fuel versus another. Implementation of jurisdiction-specific policies and programs can be dependent on, and can affect the pace of, technological advancements, the granting of necessary permits by governing authorities, the availability and acceptability of cost-effective, verifiable carbon credits, the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability-related standards, evolving regulatory or other requirements affecting ESG standards or other disclosures, and evolving standards for tracking, reporting, marketing and advertising relating to emissions and emission reductions and removals. 
 Significant uncertainty remains as to the pace and extent to which the transition to a lower carbon future will progress, which is dependent, in part, on further advancements and changes in policy, technology, and customer and consumer preferences. The level of expenditure required to comply with new or potential climate change-related laws and regulations and the amount of additional investments needed in new or existing technology or facilities, such as carbon capture and storage, is difficult to predict with certainty and is expected to vary depending on the actual laws and regulations enacted, available technology options, customer and consumer preferences, the company s activities, and market conditions. Although the future is uncertain, many published outlooks conclude that fossil fuels will remain a significant part of an energy system that increasingly incorporates lower carbon sources of supply for many years to come. 
 Chevron supports the Paris Agreement s global approach to governments addressing climate change and continues to take actions to help lower the carbon intensity of its operations while continuing to meet the demand for energy. Chevron believes that broad, market-based mechanisms are the most efficient approach to addressing GHG emission reductions. Chevron integrates climate change-related issues and the regulatory and other responses to these issues into its strategy and planning, capital investment reviews, and risk management tools and processes, where it believes they are applicable. They are also factored into the company s long-range supply, demand, and energy price forecasts. These forecasts reflect estimates of long-range effects from climate change-related policy actions, such as electric vehicle and renewable fuel penetration, energy efficiency standards, and demand response to oil and natural gas prices. 
 
 3 Incorporated in Delaware in 1926 as Standard Oil Company of California, the company adopted the name Chevron Corporation in 1984 and ChevronTexaco Corporation in 2001. In 2005, ChevronTexaco Corporation changed its name to Chevron Corporation. As used in this report, the term Chevron and such terms as the company, the corporation, our, we, us and its may refer to Chevron Corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated otherwise they do not include affiliates of Chevron i.e., those companies generally owned 50 percent or less. All of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of any of the separate companies, each of which manages its own affairs.

The company will continue to develop oil and gas resources to meet customers and consumers demand for energy. At the same time, Chevron believes that the future of energy is lower carbon. The company will continue to maintain flexibility in its portfolio to be responsive to changes in policy, technology, and customer and consumer preferences. Chevron aims to grow its oil and gas business, lower the carbon intensity of its operations and grow lower carbon businesses in renewable fuels, carbon capture and offsets, hydrogen and other emerging technologies. To grow its lower carbon businesses, Chevron plans to target sectors of the economy where emissions are harder to abate or that cannot be easily electrified, while leveraging the company s capabilities, assets, partnerships, and customer relationships. The company s oil and gas business may increase or decrease depending upon regulatory or market forces, among other factors. 
 Chevron s previously disclosed 2050 net zero upstream aspiration, carbon intensity targets and planned lower-carbon capital spend through 2028 can be found on pages 35 through 36 of the company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Chevron s goals, targets and aspirations reflect Chevron s current plans, and Chevron regularly evaluates its goals, targets and aspirations and may eliminate, increase or decrease them for various reasons, including market conditions; changes in its portfolio; and financial, operational, regulatory, reputational, legal and other factors. The company s ability to achieve any aspiration, target or objective is subject to numerous risks, many of which are outside of our control. Examples of such risks include: (1) sufficient and substantial advances in technology, including the continuing progress of commercially viable technologies and low- or non-carbon-based energy sources; (2) laws, governmental regulation, policies, and other enabling actions, including those regarding subsidies, tax and other incentives as well as the granting of necessary permits by governing authorities; (3) the availability and acceptability of cost-effective, verifiable carbon credits; (4) the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability-related standards; (5) evolving regulatory requirements, including changes to IPCC s Global Warming Potentials and the U.S. EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, affecting ESG standards or disclosures; (6) evolving standards for tracking and reporting on emissions and emissions reductions and removals; (7) customer and consumer preferences and use of the company s products or substitute products; (8) actions taken by the company s competitors in response to legislation and regulations; and (9) successful negotiations for carbon capture and storage and nature-based solutions. Please refer to the risk factors regarding our aspirations, targets, and disclosures related to environmental, social, and governance matters included on pages 25 through 26 of the company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Income Taxes The effective tax rate for the company can change substantially during periods of significant earnings volatility. This is due to the mix effects that are impacted by both the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arise in higher or lower tax rate jurisdictions. As a result, a decline or increase in the effective income tax rate in one period may not be indicative of expected results in future periods. Additional information related to the company s effective income tax rate is included in Note 10 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 In December 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) issued model rules for a new 15 percent global minimum tax (Pillar Two), and various jurisdictions in which the company operates enacted or are in the process of enacting Pillar Two legislation. Certain aspects of the tax under the Pillar Two framework are effective in 2024 in some jurisdictions and in 2025 (or later) in others. Although we do not currently expect that Pillar Two will have a material impact on our results of operations, we are continuing to evaluate the impact of legislative adoption by individual countries. 
 Supply Chain and Inflation Impacts The company is actively managing its contracting, procurement, and supply chain activities to effectively manage costs and facilitate supply chain resiliency and continuity in support of the company s operational goals. Third party costs for capital and operating expenses can be subject to external factors beyond the company s control including, but not limited to: severe weather or civil unrest, delays in construction, global and local supply chain distribution issues, inflation, tariffs or other taxes imposed on goods or services, and market-based prices charged by the industry s material and service providers. Chevron utilizes contracts with various pricing mechanisms, which may result in a lag before the company s costs reflect changes in market trends.

Table of Contents 

While macroeconomic inflation has slowed, trends in the cost of goods and services vary by spend category. The labor market remains tight, and suppliers are passing along wage rate increases for labor intensive operations. Chevron has applied inflation mitigation strategies to temper these cost increases, including fixed price and index-based contracts. Lead times for key capital equipment remain long and availability of offshore and specialized equipment is under pressure, with some experiencing upward pricing movements. Chevron has addressed equipment cost increases and long lead times by partnering with suppliers on demand planning, volume commitments, standardization, and scope optimization. Cost pressures for materials and onshore drilling and completion equipment in the United States continue to ease. 
 Acquisition and Disposition of Assets The company continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not expected to provide sufficient long-term value and to acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset base to help augment the company s financial performance and value growth. The company is targeting 10-15 billion of asset sales over the 5 year period ending in 2028. Asset dispositions and restructurings may result in significant gains or losses in future periods. In addition, some assets are sold along with their related liabilities, such as abandonment and decommissioning obligations. In certain instances, such transferred obligations have reverted, and may in the future revert, to the company and result in losses that could be significant. For example, in fourth quarter 2023, the company recognized an after-tax loss of 1.9 billion related to abandonment and decommissioning obligations from previously sold oil and gas production assets in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, because the companies that purchased these assets have filed for protection under the U.S. bankruptcy courts. The company is not currently aware of any additional potential material exposure that is reasonably possible. 
 In October 2024, the company announced that Chevron Canada Limited, an indirect subsidiary, and its related entity entered into a definitive agreement to sell their 20 percent non-operated interest in the Athabasca Oil Sands Project and 70 percent operated interest in the Duvernay shale in Alberta, Canada, to Canadian Natural Resources Limited for 6.5 billion before taxes. The sale is expected to close in fourth quarter 2024, and upon close of the sale, the buyer will assume the asset retirement obligations. In 2023, these assets produced 84 thousand barrels of oil-equivalent per day and generated over 2.3 billion of sales and approximately 700 million of net income. As part of the sale, the company expects to recognize a reduction of approximately 700 million barrels of oil-equivalent proved reserves. 
 In October 2023, the company announced that it had entered into a definitive merger agreement with Hess Corporation. Refer to Note 17 Agreement to Acquire Hess Corporation for additional information. 
 Other Impacts The company closely monitors developments in the financial and credit markets, the level of worldwide economic activity, and the implications for the company of movements in commodity prices and downstream margins. Management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planning. 
 The company recently announced plans to achieve 2-3 billion in structural cost reductions by the end of 2026. These cost savings will largely come from optimizing the portfolio, leveraging technology to enhance productivity, and changing how and where work is performed, including expanded use of global capability centers. In relation to these efforts, the Company expects to recognize restructuring and reorganization charges in future periods, which could be significant. 
 Comments related to earnings trends for the company s major business areas are as follows: 
 Upstream Earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry prices for crude oil and natural gas. Crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over which the company has no control, including product demand connected with global economic conditions, industry production and inventory levels, technology advancements, production quotas or other actions imposed by OPEC+ countries, actions of regulators, weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, natural and human causes beyond the company s control, and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest or political uncertainty. Any of these factors could also inhibit the company s production capacity in an affected region. The company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses.

The longer-term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors, including the company s ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas, changes in fiscal terms of contracts, the pace and extent of the energy transition, and changes in tax, environmental and other applicable laws and regulations. 
 In April 2024, Tengizchevroil LLP (TCO) achieved start-up of the Wellhead Pressure Management Project (WPMP) and as of September 2024, all four pressure boost facility compressors are online and 14 metering stations have been converted to low pressure. Additional metering station conversions will continue for the remainder of the year. TCO continues to make progress on the Future Growth Project with start-up expected in the first-half of 2025. 
 Chevron has interests in Venezuelan assets operated by independent affiliates. Chevron has been conducting limited activities in Venezuela consistent with the authorization provided pursuant to general licenses issued by the United States government. In fourth quarter 2022, Chevron received General License 41 from the United States government, enabling the company to resume activity in Venezuela subject to certain limitations, and the company continues such activities under this General License. The financial results for Chevron s business in Venezuela are being recorded as non-equity investments since 2020, where income is only recognized when cash is received and production and reserves are not included in the company s results. Crude oil liftings in Venezuela started in first quarter 2023, which has positively impacted the company s results. The company s independent affiliates have continued to maintain safe and reliable operations; however, future impact on results of operations and financial condition remain uncertain. 
 Governments have imposed and may impose additional sanctions and other trade laws, restrictions and regulations that could lead to disruption in our ability to produce, transport and/or export crude in the region around Russia. The financial impacts of such risks, including presently imposed sanctions, are not currently material for the company; however, it remains uncertain how long these conditions may last or how severe they may become. 
 Chevron holds a 39.7 percent interest in the Leviathan field and a 25 percent interest in the Tamar field in Israel. Despite the ongoing conflict between Israel and various regional adversaries, the company continues to maintain safe and reliable operations while meeting its contractual commitments. The project to install a third gathering pipeline at Leviathan is expected to be delayed; however, completion is currently still expected in 2025. The company continues to monitor the ongoing conflict in the region, and any future impacts on the company s results of operations and financial condition remain uncertain. 
 Chevron operates and holds interests in the Bibiyana, Jalalabad and Moulavi Bazar fields in Bangladesh. Recent political unrest in the country has not impacted the company's operations to date; however, the future impacts, if any, on the company s results of operations and financial condition remain uncertain.

The chart above shows the trend in benchmark prices for Brent crude oil, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, and U.S. Henry Hub natural gas. The Brent price averaged 83 per barrel for the first nine months of 2024, compared with 82 per barrel during the first nine months of 2023, and ended October at about 73 per barrel. The WTI price averaged 78 per barrel for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 77 per barrel in the first nine months of 2023, and ended October at about 69 per barrel. The majority of the company s equity crude production is priced based on the Brent and WTI benchmarks. Crude prices decreased during third quarter 2024 due to concerns over lower global demand, despite increased geopolitical risk, declining inventory levels, and an interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve. (See page 38 for the company s average U.S. and international crude oil sales prices.) 
 Price changes for natural gas are also impacted by seasonal supply, demand and infrastructure conditions in regional and local markets. In the U.S., prices at Henry Hub averaged 2.20 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) for the first nine months of 2024, compared with 2.49 per MCF during the first nine months of 2023. Prices in third quarter 2024 averaged 2.12 per MCF. Lower third quarter 2024 prices have started to incentivize production cuts, but storage levels remain above their five-year average. At the end of October 2024, the Henry Hub spot price was 1.94 per MCF. 
 Outside the U.S., price changes for natural gas also depend on a wide range of supply, demand and regulatory circumstances. The company s long-term contract prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) are typically linked to crude oil prices. Most of the equity LNG offtake from the operated Australian LNG assets is committed under binding long-term contracts, with some sold in the spot LNG market. The temporary pause on approving LNG export authorizations by the U.S. Department of Energy has not had a significant impact on current LNG prices. International natural gas realizations averaged 7.20 per MCF during the first nine months of 2024, compared with 7.81 per MCF in the same period last year. (See page 38 for the company s average natural gas sales prices for the U.S. and international regions.) 
 Production The company s worldwide net oil-equivalent production in the first nine months of 2024 averaged 3.33 million barrels per day, an increase of 10 percent from the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to the acquisition of PDC Energy, Inc. (PDC) and production growth in the Permian and Denver-Julesburg (DJ) Basin in the U.S., partly offset by planned downtime in Nigeria and exit from Myanmar. About 24 percent of the company s net oil-equivalent production in the first nine months of 2024 occurred in the OPEC+ member countries of Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and the Republic of Congo. 
 Refer to the Results of Operations section on page 32 for additional discussion of the company s upstream business. 
 Downstream Earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining, manufacturing and marketing of products that include gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, lubricants, fuel oil, fuel and lubricant additives, petrochemicals and renewable fuels. Industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and regional supply-and-demand balance for refined products, petrochemicals and renewable fuels, and by changes in the price of crude oil, other refinery and petrochemical feedstocks, and natural gas. Industry margins can also be influenced by inventory levels, geopolitical events, costs of materials and services, refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization, maintenance programs, and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather, fires or other operational events. 
 Other factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the company s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, the effectiveness of its crude oil and product supply functions, and the volatility of tanker-charter rates for the company s shipping operations, which are driven by the industry s demand for crude oil and product tankers. Other factors beyond the company s control include the general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the company s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, and changes in tax, environmental, and other applicable laws and regulations. 
 Chevron owns and operates a refinery in Richmond, California. A previous tax settlement between the City of Richmond and the company was replaced with a new agreement that is effective July 1, 2025. The company will pay 550 million to the City of Richmond over ten years as part of an agreement that also provides protections against future new tax liabilities during the ten-year agreement.

California Assembly Bill ABX2-1, signed into law on October 14, 2024, authorizes the California Energy Commission (CEC) to develop and impose requirements to maintain minimum inventory levels of refined transportation fuels with respect to certain of the company s downstream activities in California. The law further expands on CEC s existing authority to impose requirements governing the timing of turnarounds and maintenance. It is uncertain whether, or when, the CEC will establish any such requirements. The company will evaluate the impact that ABX2-1 and any forthcoming CEC regulations may have on its operations in California and results of operations when the regulations have been promulgated. 
 The company s most significant marketing areas are the West Coast and Gulf Coast of the United States and Asia Pacific. Chevron operates or has significant ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas. 
 Refer to the Results of Operations section beginning on page 33 for additional discussion of the company s downstream operations. 
 All Other consists of worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled 4.7 billion at September 30, 2024, and 8.2 billion at year-end 2023. The company holds its cash with a diverse group of major financial institutions and has processes and safeguards in place to manage its cash balances and mitigate the risk of loss. Cash provided by operating activities in the first nine months of 2024 was 22.8 billion, compared with 23.2 billion in the year-ago period. Capital expenditures totaled 12.1 billion in the first nine months of 2024, up 642 million from the year-ago period largely due to higher investments in upstream, including post-acquisition spend on legacy PDC assets. Proceeds and deposits related to asset sales and returns of investment totaled 620 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 410 million in the year-ago period. Cash provided by financing activities includes proceeds from shares issued for stock option exercises of 194 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared with 237 million in the year-ago period. 
 Dividends The company paid dividends of 8.9 billion to common stockholders during the first nine months of 2024. In October 2024, the company declared a quarterly dividend of 1.63 per common share, payable in December 2024. 
 Debt and Finance Lease Liabilities Chevron s total debt and finance lease liabilities were 25.8 billion at September 30, 2024, up from 20.8 billion at December 31, 2023, as the company issued commercial paper and tax-exempt bonds, and retired a bond that matured during the period. 
 The company s primary source for working capital needs is its commercial paper program. The outstanding balance for the company s commercial paper program at September 30, 2024, was 6.0 billion, and there was no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2023. The company s debt and finance lease liabilities due within one year, consisting primarily of commercial paper, the current portion of long-term debt and redeemable long-term obligations, totaled 13.2 billion at September 30, 2024, and 5.1 billion at December 31, 2023. Of these amounts, 8.1 billion was reclassified to long-term at September 30, 2024, and 4.5 billion was reclassified to long-term at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, settlement of these obligations was not expected to require the use of working capital within one year, as the company had the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to continually refinance them. 
 At September 30, 2024, the company had 8.1 billion in 364-day committed credit facilities with various major banks that enable the refinancing of short-term obligations. The credit facilities allow the company the option to convert outstanding short-term obligations into a term loan for a period of up to one year from the facilities termination date. This supports commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for general corporate purposes. The company s practice has been to replace expiring commitments with new commitments on substantially the same terms, maintaining levels management believes appropriate. Any borrowings under the facilities would be unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), or an average of base lending rates published by specified banks and on terms reflecting the company s strong credit rating. No borrowings were outstanding under these facilities at September 30, 2024. 
 The major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate the company s debt, and the company s cost of borrowing can increase or decrease depending on these debt ratings. The company has outstanding bonds issued by Chevron Corporation, CUSA, Texaco Capital Inc. and Noble Energy, Inc. Most of these securities are the obligations of, or guaranteed by, Chevron Corporation and are rated AA- by Standard and Poor s Corporation (S P) and Aa2 by Moody s Investors Service (Moody s). The company s U.S. commercial paper is rated A-1+ by S P and P-1 by Moody s. All of these ratings denote high-quality, investment-grade securities. 
 The company s future debt level is dependent primarily on results of operations, cash that may be generated from asset dispositions, the capital program, lending commitments to affiliates, and shareholder distributions. Based on its high-quality debt ratings, the company believes that it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash requirements. During extended periods of low prices for crude oil and natural gas and narrow margins for refined products and commodity chemicals, the company has the flexibility to modify capital spending plans, discontinue or curtail the stock repurchase program, sell assets, and increase borrowings to continue paying the common stock dividend. The company remains committed to retaining high-quality debt ratings.

 Common Stock Repurchase Program On January 25, 2023, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of the company s shares of common stock in an aggregate amount of 75 billion (the 2023 Program ). The 2023 Program took effect on April 1, 2023, and does not have a fixed expiration date. In the aggregate, the company has repurchased 141.4 million shares for 21.9 billion under the 2023 Program, including 32.2 million shares repurchased for 4.7 billion in third quarter 2024. Chevron expects share repurchases in the fourth quarter 2024 to be between 4.0- 4.75 billion. 
 Repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, by block purchases, in privately negotiated transactions or in such other manner as determined by the company. The timing of the repurchases and the actual amount repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of the company s shares, general market and economic conditions, and other factors. The stock repurchase program and any forward guidance as to expected repurchases do not obligate the company to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and the program may be discontinued or resumed at any time. 
 Noncontrolling Interests The company had noncontrolling interests of 828 million at September 30, 2024, and 972 million at December 31, 2023. Included within noncontrolling interests is 166 million at December 31, 2023, of redeemable noncontrolling interest.

PART II 
 OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 Item 103 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires disclosure of certain legal proceedings that involve governmental authorities as a party and that the company reasonably believes would result in 1.0 million or more of monetary sanctions, exclusive of interest and costs, under federal, state and local laws that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or primarily for the purpose of protecting the environment. The following proceedings include those matters relating to third quarter 2024 and any material developments with respect to matters previously reported in Chevron s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 As previously disclosed, in April 2015, Noble Energy, Inc. (Noble) entered into a joint consent decree (Consent Decree) with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the State of Colorado to improve emission control systems at a number of condensate storage tanks within the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) Basin. While the associated civil penalty was paid by Noble previously, the Consent Decree provides for stipulated penalties for noncompliance with the Consent Decree. The DOJ, EPA and the State of Colorado have requested payment of 1.5 million in stipulated penalties accrued under the Consent Decree, which was paid in August 2024. 
 Please see information related to other legal proceedings in Note 11 Litigation . 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Some inherent risks could materially impact the company s results of operations or financial condition. Information about risk factors for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, does not differ materially from that set forth under the heading Risk Factors on pages 20 through 26 of the company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, other than as reflected in the risk factor below. 
 Chevron may not complete the acquisition of Hess Corporation within the time frame the company anticipates or at all, which could have adverse effects on Chevron The completion of the acquisition of Hess Corporation (Hess) is subject to a number of conditions, including the expiration or termination of any waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended HSR Act) and approval of any Guyanese governmental body, agency or authority that asserts its approval is required in connection with the transaction, each of which make the completion and timing of the completion of the merger uncertain. 
 Hess Guyana Exploration Limited (HGEL), a wholly owned subsidiary of Hess, is currently in arbitration with respect to the right of first refusal (Stabroek ROFR) contained in an operating agreement among HGEL, affiliates of Exxon Mobil Corporation (Exxon), and China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) regarding the Stabroek Block offshore Guyana. The arbitration merits hearing about the applicability of the Stabroek ROFR to the merger has been scheduled for May 2025, with a decision expected in the following three months. If the arbitration does not result in a confirmation that the Stabroek ROFR is inapplicable to the merger, and if Chevron, Hess, Exxon and/or CNOOC do not otherwise agree upon an acceptable resolution, then there would be a failure of a closing condition under the merger agreement, in which case the merger would not close. 
 On December 7, 2023, Chevron and Hess each received a request for additional information and documentary materials (Second Request) from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Following the FTC review of the transaction, on September 30, 2024, the FTC announced that a majority of the Commission voted to accept a consent agreement among the FTC, Chevron and Hess, resolving the concerns the FTC identified during its review of the transaction. Chevron and Hess have taken and will continue to take appropriate steps to maintain our ability under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act of 1976, as amended (HSR Act) to close the merger following satisfactory resolution of the ongoing arbitration proceedings regarding preemptive rights in the Stabroek Block joint operating agreement, including filing additional notifications under the HSR Act. Additionally, if any Guyanese governmental body, agency or authority of competent jurisdiction asserts that 
 43 

Table of Contents 

its approval is required as a result of the consequences of the merger in Guyana on Hess assets in Guyana (which has not occurred as of the filing date of this report), approval of such governmental body, agency or authority will become a condition to each party s obligation to complete the merger. 
 The failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the acquisition for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring at all. In addition, the terms and conditions of the required regulatory authorizations and consents for the acquisition that are granted, if any, may impose requirements, limitations or costs or place restrictions on the conduct of the company s business after the transaction or materially delay the completion of the acquisition. A delay in completing the acquisition could cause the company to realize some or all of the benefits later than we otherwise expect to realize them if the acquisition is successfully completed within the anticipated timeframe, which could result in additional transaction costs or in other negative effects associated with uncertainty about completion of the acquisition.

The RRP was formed from a spin-out on July 1, 2002 of the defined benefit portion of the liabilities of the Chevron Corporation Excess Benefit Plan (the Excess Plan which had been originally established effective January 1, 1976. On December 10, 2003, the defined benefit portions of the liabilities of the then active former Texaco and Caltex employees participating in the Supplemental Pension Plan of Texaco Inc. and the Excess-Benefit Plan for Employees of ChevronTexaco Global Energy Inc. were also transferred to the RRP. 
 (b) The Chevron Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan (the SRP was established effective July 1, 2002 to provide additional retirement benefits due to certain awards under the Management Incentive Plan of the Corporation, and on December 10, 2003 was expanded to include additional retirement benefits due to similar executive bonus program awards for former Texaco and Caltex employees. The SRP was formed from a spin-out on July 1, 2002 of the bonus portion of the liabilities of the Excess Plan, and from the later December 10, 2003 spin-out of the liabilities of the then active former Texaco and Caltex employees participating in the Supplemental Bonus Retirement Plan of Texaco Inc. and the Pension Supplementation Plan of ChevronTexaco Global Energy Inc.

The Unocal Nonqualified Retirement Plans covered eligible employees who were active employees of Unocal or its affiliates on or after January 1, 2005, and provided additional retirement benefits that were not provided under the qualified Unocal Retirement Plan due to the limitations of sections 401(a)(17) and 415 of the Code, to deferred compensation not counting as benefits bearing compensation, and to the calculation of retirement benefits using the high three annual Unocal incentive pay awards, whether or not consecutive. Effective as of July 1, 2006, the Unocal Nonqualified Retirement Plans were merged into this RRP. The benefit calculation and benefit distribution rules that apply to eligible employees who incurred a Separation from Service prior to July 1, 2006 are described in the Unocal Nonqualified Retirement Plans as in effect as of the time such employees incurred a Separation from Service (as amended to comply with section 409A of the Code).

Effective August 1, 2024, the RRP was amended and restated to include a claims procedure in accordance with ERISA Section 502 and to update the beneficiary hierarchy list to match that in the qualified plans. The benefit calculation and benefit distribution rules that apply to eligible employees who incurred a Separation from Service between January 1, 2005 and June 30, 2006 are described in Appendix B.

Except as may be required by applicable law, or as is described below relating to domestic relations orders, no Restoration Benefit or property interest in this RRP may be assigned (either at law or in equity), alienated, anticipated or subject to attachment, bankruptcy, garnishment, levy, execution or other legal or equitable process.

In the event of an amendment or termination of the RRP, a Participant s Restoration Benefit shall not be less than the Restoration Benefit to which the Participant would have been entitled if he or she had incurred a Separation from Service immediately prior to such amendment or termination, except to the extent 
 (1) The RRP was amended or terminated to comply with changes in the Code 
 13 

(2) Some or all of the amount calculated under the RRP s terms that existed immediately prior to such amendment or termination is subsequently provided from another plan.

 The A+B Calculation is the sum of the A Calculation and the B Calculation . 
 The A Calculation is the difference (but not less than zero) between (i) the Participant s Prior Period Plan benefit calculated according to the provisions of the Prior Period Plan based only on the Participant s service and earnings during the prior period(s) of employment, and (ii) the present value of all payments previously made or scheduled to be made in the future under the Prior Period Plan. 
 The B Calculation is the Participant s Restoration Benefit calculated according to Section IV.(a)(1)(A) or (a)(2)(A) (as applicable) based only on the Participant s service and earnings during the latest period of employment. 
 The C Calculation is the difference between (i) and (ii), where (i) is the Participant s Restoration Benefit (before offset for the Retirement Plan benefit) calculated according to Section IV.(a)(1)(A) or (a)(2)(A) (as applicable) based on the Participant s service and earnings during all periods of employment, and (ii) is the sum of the present value of all payments previously made (or scheduled to be made in the future) under the Retirement Plan and the Prior Period Plan (if any) with respect to prior period(s) of employment, and the present value of the benefit to be paid under the Retirement Plan with respect to both the prior period of employment (to the extent not previously made or scheduled to be made in the future) and the current period of employment. For the purposes of the C Calculation , the benefit calculation according to Section IV.(a)(1)(A) or (a)(2)(A) (as applicable) will use the Retirement Plan formula in effect for the Participant at the time of his or her latest Separation from Service. 
 (3) Present values shall be determined using the interest rates and other actuarial factors in effect under the Retirement Plan as of the date this calculation is made. 
 (i) Excess Plan Top-Hat Plan Status . To the extent that the RRP provides a benefit in excess of the limitations on contributions and benefits imposed by section 415 of the Code, the RRP is intended to be an excess benefit plan within the meaning of section 3(36) of ERISA, that is an unfunded deferred compensation program.

 (k) 409A Compliance . This RRP is intended to comply with section 409A of the Code and shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with that intent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event there is a failure to comply with section 409A of the Code (or the regulations thereunder), the Committee shall have the discretion to accelerate the time or form of payment of a Participant s Restoration Benefit, but only to the extent of the amount required to be included in income as a result of such failure. 
 (l) Choice of Law . The RRP shall be administered, construed and governed in accordance with ERISA, the Code, and, to the extent not preempted by ERISA, by the laws of the State of California, but without regard to its conflict of law rules.

For purposes of this Section VIII., approval shall mean written approval (by a person or entity within the Corporation having the authority to do so) of such amendment or termination. 
 (c) Restrictions on Certain Actions Prior to or Following, a Change in Control . Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of the RRP and except to the extent required to comply with applicable law, (i) any amendment or termination of the RRP which is executed or would otherwise become effective prior to a Change in Control at the request of a third party who effectuates a Change in Control shall not be an effective amendment or termination of the RRP during the Benefit Protection Period and (ii) the RRP shall not be amended at any time if to do so would adversely affect the rights derived under the RRP from this Section VIII. of any individual who is a Participant during the Benefit Protection Period or a Beneficiary with respect to a Participant during the Benefit Protection Period. Furthermore, following a Change in Control, no person shall take any action that would directly or indirectly have the same effect as any of the prohibited amendments listed in Section VIII.(a).

 16 

affected by any circumstances, including, without limitation, any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which the Corporation may have against the Participant or others.

 SECTION I. INTRODUCTION .

 (b) Effective July 1, 2006, the ESIP-RP was amended and restated to incorporate certain ESIP-RP changes which occurred subsequent to July 1, 2002, and to rename the ESIP-RP the Chevron Corporation ESIP Restoration Plan. From July 1, 2002 through December 31, 2005, this ESIP-RP provided additional retirement benefits to those provided under the ESIP because the ESIP s benefits are subject to limitations on contributions imposed by sections 401(a)(17) or 415 of the Code and because the ESIP s definition of Regular Earnings did not include salary deferrals under the Chevron Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan for Management Employees (together with the Chevron Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan for Management Employees II, the Deferred Compensation Plan ).

 (f) Effective January 1, 2009, the ESIP-RP was amended and restated in order to comply with the Internal Revenue Service s final regulations under Section 409A. Because of certain changes to the ESIP s definition of Regular Earnings effective on or after January 1,

2008, the ESIP-RP was also amended to continue to include salary deferrals under the Deferred Compensation Plan and exclude awards under the Chevron Incentive Plan (or successor plan) in the compensation used for purposes of this ESIP-RP. 
 (g) Effective January 1, 2017, the ESIP-RP was amended to replace the definition of Beneficiary and, effective June 1, 2017, to cease accepting domestic relations orders. 
 (h) Effective January 1, 2018, the ESIP-RP was amended and restated in order to use the closing price of Chevron Stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange to value transactions in shares of Chevron Stock for purposes of calculating benefits under the ESIP-RP, and to incorporate prior administrative amendments.

 (e) No Assignment of Property Rights . Except as may be required by applicable law, or as is described below relating to domestic relations orders, no Plan Benefit or property interest in this ESIP-RP may be assigned (either at law or in equity), alienated, anticipated or subject to attachment, bankruptcy, garnishment, levy, execution or other legal or equitable process.

When the reemployed Participant subsequently incurs a Separation from Service, such new Account will be distributed in accordance with Section V. of this ESIP-RP without regard to any election made with respect to, or distribution schedule applicable to, amounts attributable to the Participant s previous employment. For this purpose, a distribution election only with respect to the Plan Benefit attributable to the additional service that is made by the Participant no later than the last day of the calendar year immediately preceding the first calendar year in which such Plan Benefit accrues or such earlier date as specified by the Committee shall be treated as the initial distribution election under Section V.(b) with respect to such Plan Benefit.

 (j) Excess Plan Top-Hat Plan Status . To the extent that the ESIP-RP provides a benefit in excess of the limitations on contributions and benefits imposed by section 415 of the Code, the ESIP-RP is intended to be an excess benefit plan within the meaning of section 3(36) of ERISA, that is an unfunded deferred compensation program. Otherwise, the ESIP-RP is intended to be an unfunded deferred compensation program that is maintained for a select group of management or highly compensated employees as set forth in Title I of ERISA. The ESIP-RP shall be implemented, administered and interpreted in a manner consistent with this intention. 
 (k) Successors and Assigns . The ESIP-RP shall be binding upon the Corporation, its Successors and Assigns. Notwithstanding that the ESIP-RP may be binding upon a Successor or Assign by operation of law, the Corporation shall also require any Successor or Assign to expressly assume and agree to be bound by the ESIP-RP in the same manner and to the same extent that the Corporation would be if no succession or assignment had taken place. 
 
 13

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event there is a failure to comply with section 409A of the Code (or the regulations thereunder), the Committee shall have the discretion to accelerate the time or form of payment of a Participant s Plan Benefit, but only to the extent of the amount required to be included in income as a result of such failure. 
 (m) Choice of Law . The ESIP-RP shall be administered, construed and governed in accordance with ERISA, the Code, and, to the extent not preempted by ERISA, by the laws of the State of California, but without regard to its conflict of law rules. Notwithstanding the foregoing, domestic relations orders and the Section II.(y) definition of Misconduct shall be subject to the jurisdiction s law that would otherwise be applicable, but without regard to that particular jurisdiction s conflict of laws rules.

 14 

constitute a Change in Control shall have been made, unless thereafter any plans to effect the Change in Control have been abandoned and the event which would have constituted the Change in Control has not occurred.
