together with its assets and liabilities, was sold to a non-affiliated third party. Vitalcare Holding Corporation subsequently reincorporated
in Nevada by merger into China Advanced Technology.

Goliath Film and Media Holdings Goliath or the Company ). All share numbers herein have been adjusted for
an affected as of the Closing Date. The forward stock split was reflected in the trading market on February

accounting acquirer, and the prior operations of Goliath (formerly China Advanced Technology) are consolidated for accounting purposes. 

The
Company is engaged in the production and distribution of motion pictures and television content. The Company has begun its planned principal
business purpose with revenue consisting of primarily film residuals. 

production costs. 

The
Company recognizes revenue when the distributor confirms to the Company that the film has been delivered to the distributor with all
technical and document deliveries received, waived or deferred and the film has been entered into the distributor s rights system.
The Company recognizes revenue from the distribution of its films on a net revenue basis as Mar Vista distributes the films to Mar Vista s
end customers. Costs are borne by the distributor. 

The
Company evaluates whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as
commissions. Generally, when the Company is primarily obligated in a transaction, are subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing
prices and selecting suppliers, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded at the gross sale price. The Company
generally records the net amounts as commissions earned if we are not primarily obligated and do not have latitude in establishing prices. 

For
the three and six months ended October 31, 2024, we had revenues of and , respectively. For the three and six months ended
October 31, 2023, we had no revenues.

six months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 as the company is not currently promoting its films. 

research and development expense for the three and six months ended
October 31, 2024 and 2023. 

The
carrying value of financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value is measured on a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Financial
assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value when a significant event occurs. The
Company had no financial assets or liabilities carried and measured on a nonrecurring basis during the reporting periods. Financial assets
and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value each time a financial statement is prepared.
The Company had no financial assets and/or liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis at October 31, 2024, assets and liabilities
approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. 

The
availability of inputs observable in the market varies from instrument to instrument and depends on a variety of factors including the
type of instrument, whether the instrument is actively traded, and other characteristics particular to the transaction. For many financial
instruments, pricing inputs are readily observable in the market, the valuation methodology used is widely accepted by market participants,
and the valuation does not require significant management discretion. For other financial instruments, pricing inputs are less observable
in the market and may require management judgment.

shares of preferred stock, par value, with such rights, preferences and designation and to be
issued in such series as determined by the Board of Directors. shares of preferred stock are issued and outstanding at October 31,
2024 and 2023. 

The
Company has authorized shares of par value common stock, of which and shares are outstanding
at October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, respectively. shares of common stock have been issued during the three and six months ended
October 31, 2024. 

As
of October 31, 2024, the Company has not issued an aggregate common shares to three shareholders (a total of to
related parties and to a third party). These shares are reflected in the weighted-average shares outstanding but they are not
included in the Company s outstanding shares balance of . 

Under
the going concern assumption, an entity is ordinarily viewed as continuing in business for the foreseeable future with neither the intention
nor the necessity of liquidation, ceasing trading, or seeking protection from creditors pursuant to laws or regulations. Accordingly,
assets and liabilities are recorded on the basis that the entity will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in
the normal course of business. 

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plan described in
the preceding paragraph and eventually attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments
that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

During
the next year, the Company s foreseeable cash requirements will relate to continual development of the operations of its business,
maintaining its good standing and making the requisite filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company may experience
a cash shortfall and be required to raise additional capital. 

Historically,
the Company has relied upon internally generated funds and funds from the sale of shares of stock and related party loans to finance
its operations and growth. Management may raise additional capital through future public or private offerings of the Company s
stock or through loans from private investors, although there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such financing. The
Company s failure to do so could have a material and adverse effect upon its and its shareholders. 

In
the past year, the Company funded operations through contributions from officers and affiliates of the Company. For the coming year,
the Company plans to continue to fund the Company through debt and securities sales and issuances, focus on a possible joint venture
or merger until the company generates revenues through the operations of such merged company or joint venture as stated above.

Description
of Business 

Background. 

The
Company was incorporated in Nevada on February 16, 2010 under the name China Advanced Technology as the successor by merger
to Vitalcare Diabetes Treatment Centers, Inc. Vitalcare ). In February and March 2010, Vitalcare underwent a holding company
reorganization under Delaware law, pursuant to which it became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vitalcare Holding Corporation, and Vitalcare,
together with its assets and liabilities, was sold to a non-affiliated third party. Vitalcare Holding Corporation subsequently reincorporated
in Nevada by merger into China Advanced. 

Vitalcare
was in the business of administering medical clinics specializing in diabetes treatment. It was the successor to Network Financial Services,
Inc. Network ), which went public in an underwritten offering in 1987. Network was engaged in mortgage origination, and
changed its name to Westmark Group Holdings Westmark in 1993 in connection with the acquisition of Westmark Mortgage
from Primark Corporation. Westmark ceased operations at some time in 2006, and in 2006 ceased filing reports under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. The corporate entity was thereafter known as Viking Consolidated, Inc. (2006), Tailor Aquaponics World Wide, Inc. (2007)
and Diversified Acquisitions (2007) until it entered the medical clinic business in early 2008. The Company has no information regarding
any business activities from 2006 after the mortgage origination business closed, to early 2008. 

On
October 25, 2011, Goliath Film and Media International, a Nevada corporation, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the
 Exchange Agreement ), pursuant to which Goliath Film and Media International was acquired by China Advanced Technology.
Prior to the acquisition, our principal operations consisted of internet marketing, and were conducted through a wholly owned subsidiary,

Overview. 

Goliath
Film and Media Holdings, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries Goliath Film and Media International and Goliath Movie Partners 1, LLC
(collectively, Goliath or the Company ), develops, produces and licenses for distribution, domestically and
internationally, quality digital content with an emphasis on niche markets of the feature motion picture and television
content segments of the entertainment industry, such as, without limitation, education, faith-based, horror and socially responsible
minority content. Goliath does not intend to engage in domestic theatrical distribution of motion pictures to any significant extent. 

In
qualified cases, Goliath will develop screenplays that will be outsourced to an independent entity for production, but will be licensed
for distribution through the Company. Also, in certain cases Goliath will produce content that is tied to working with an established
distributor that provides an advance or minimum guarantee for the production of a project that will be licensed by the participating
distributor. Goliath plans to produce content and to distribute domestically and internationally, through a wide distribution network
which includes major international theatrical exhibitors, and other distributors and television networks. We plan to utilize corporate
sponsorships as a means of reducing the costs of advertising and marketing in distribution. Further, we may augment our marketing efforts
with a limited and strategically focused advertising campaign in traditional print media with press releases targeted specifically
toward standard entertainment industry trade journals and publications on an as needed basis as well as the inclusion of
targeted social media campaigns. 

Goliath s
revenue model includes receiving revenue from distribution fees. A limited number of its content properties include projects developed
and produced by Goliath and those produced by an independent third party production companies.

Questions
and Answers 

What
is your business? 

We
develop, produce and distribute motion pictures and digital content. At this time, we do not intend to engage in theatrical releases
of motion pictures, due to the high up- front costs of advertising and marketing theatrically. However, in some specific cases the company
will consider theatrical releases based upon a four wall , limited release delivery that will be focused on targeted niche
audiences. 

What
is the timeline for your activities during the next 12 months? 

Over
the next 90 days to one year, our efforts will be concentrated on developing and producing content with distributors for licensing by
them of at least three projects. 

What
is this going to cost you? 

We
expect that producing the aforementioned content will cost approximately 150,000 per project, however licensing and distribution will
be handled by an experienced distributor for a fee of anywhere from 30 35 and the costs of advertising and marketing will be
handled by them and charged against gross distribution licensing proceeds. 

Why
are these motion pictures not being distributed already? 

The
motion pictures that are being produced by the Company and distributed by Mar Vista take anywhere from six to nine months from completion
of production and delivery to obtain licensing agreements. 

Generally,
the main reason why good, quality motion pictures are not distributed is that the production of a motion picture requires money and creativity,
and marketing a motion picture requires an entirely different set of skills. Many people dream of making a movie; few aspire to distribute
them. We estimate that there are in excess of 10,000 such motion pictures gathering dust. There also have been and continue
to be substantial tax incentives for motion picture production in many States and international Territories, so that many producers do
not need to depend on successful marketing in order to find investors for their projects. A secondary factor is the difficulty of finding
a reputable distributor. We think that our management has an excellent reputation in the industry and we will be able to obtain distribution
rights for content. Finally, many distributors as well as buyers do not have an interest in niche market films, because they see the
market as limited. Goliath sees the problem to be, rather, there is no market merely because no one has assembled a critical mass of
films for these niches. Most participants in the motion picture industry are based in Hollywood and the major coastal metropolitan
areas. As an example, our faith-based films especially are targeted toward the Bible Belt and the Flyover
Country : places that the industry has consistently overlooked. 

Why
are you able to identify and acquire these motion pictures and educational videos? 

After
attending all the major content acquisition markets around the world over the last three years, our Staff has developed relationships
with numerous quality filmmakers who need assistance in marketing and distributing their product. Goliath has also developed vital relationships
with many of the major content buyers, distributors, networks and sales agents. Many of the filmmakers have requested the Company s
assistance in marketing and distributing their product. Goliath will continue to pursue the marketing and distribution of product that
is demanded in the marketplace and desired by major aggregators, distributors, networks and studios.

So
how are you different than Amazon, Netflix, and Hulu, to name a few? How can you compete with them? They have a lot of money and name
recognition. Why wouldn t they jump into your niches? 

As
a content provider we are not competing with these entities but rather are working on providing them with quality content. As an example,
NETFLIX using its streaming platform has such a high demand for programming content, they are spending in excess of 17
billion this year for the acquisition of completed programming as well as for the development of original content by them. Therefore,
as is mentioned, part of their resources are directed toward acquiring content and part is targeting in-house and joint
venture productions of quality content. This content will be targeted to their subscription base on a domestic and international level. 

There
are a number of quality content producers that work with the major networks and content distributors, Goliath is moving toward becoming
one of these content providers. We believe there exists significant opportunities for our company in that the demand for programming
is increasing almost exponentially. Irrespective of the platform for viewing by the consumer/subscriber, the demand for quality content
is continuing to expand. The upward trend is ongoing, which is where we see an opportunity for Goliath to provide product to reach many
components of the overall market. 

Don t
cable and satellite networks already offer specialty channels like TBN (for faith based) and BET (Black Entertainment Television (for
the African-American Community)? 

As
mentioned above about NETFLIX, even though these channels maybe in niche markets they must expand the type, genre and format of the content
that they are showing in order to remain viable, therefore the opportunity to assist them by providing quality programming is ongoing
and expanding. 

What
other niches are you looking at entering? 

We
believe that there is an increasing and ongoing trend in home entertainment in servicing niches. Many viewers have cable or satellite
service with hundreds of channels, but view only a few channels that cater to their particular interests. The significant type of niche
we are targeting are the numerous immigrant groups in the United States. Other than Spanish speaking immigrants, coverage is scarce. 

There
are many interest groups that might be interested in specialty movies or programming. As an example, in Hawaii and Southern California,
for instance, surfing is quite popular, and there exists a huge body of surfing films which would be of interest. 

What
about ancillary markets? 

We
plan to incorporate advertising and marketing through social media and traditional outlets to the highest degree possible. 

How
do these distribution rights work? 

We
enter into a Distribution Agreement for each motion picture. Terms may be perpetual or limited by years. The motion pictures that we
are acquiring will have a term of five years. We will generally obtain a fee of 20 to 30 of gross revenues. Licensing will be flexible
for usage applications on a yearly or multi-year basis. Most markets, especially foreign territories have a tendency to continuously
renew content licensing. 

How
many employees do you have? Do you have an office? 

We
have no employees. Our administrative office is in Carson City, Nevada. 

Do
you have a website? 

Our
website is www.goliathfilmandmediainternational.com. We have a mirror site at www.goliathfilmandmedia.com

about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s management plan to continue as a going concern
revolves around its ability to execute its business strategy of digital content, as well as raising the necessary capital to pay ongoing
general and administrative expenses of the Company.
