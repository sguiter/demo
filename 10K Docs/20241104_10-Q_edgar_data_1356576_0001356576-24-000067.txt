 Contingent consideration, long-term Total 
 The Company's contingent consideration liabilities are related to the USWM Acquisition in 2020 and the Adamas Acquisition in 2021. The contingent consideration liabilities are measured at fair value using either a Monte Carlo simulation or the income approach. The Company classifies its contingent consideration liabilities as Level 3 fair value measurements based on the significant unobservable inputs used to estimate fair value. These reflect the inputs and assumptions the Company believes would be made by market participants. Changes in any of those inputs together or in isolation may result in significantly lower or higher fair value measurement. The change in fair value is reported on the condensed consolidated statement of earnings (loss) in Contingent consideration gain . 
 USWM Contingent Consideration 
 On June 9, 2020 (the USWM Closing Date), the Company completed its acquisition of all the outstanding equity of USWM Enterprises, LLC (USWM Enterprises) (USWM Acquisition). The USWM Acquisition included potential additional contingent consideration payments for regulatory and development milestones and sales-based milestones. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining potential contingent consideration payments are up to million in regulatory and development milestones

Table of Contents 

million related to the FDA's approval of the SPN-830 NDA and (2) million related to the subsequent commercial product launch. 
 The key assumptions considered in estimating the fair value include the estimated probability and timing of milestone achievement, such as the probability and timing of obtaining regulatory approval, timing of projected revenues, and the discount rate. 
 Adamas Contingent Consideration 
 On November 24, 2021 (the Adamas Closing Date), the Company completed its acquisition of all the outstanding equity of Adamas (Adamas Acquisition). The Adamas Acquisition included payment of non-tradable contingent value rights (CVRs) each of which represents the contractual right to receive a contingent payment upon the achievement of the applicable aggregate worldwide net product sales of GOCOVRI. 
 Each CVR represents the contractual right to receive a contingent payment of per share in cash, less any applicable withholding taxes and without interest, upon the achievement of the applicable milestone (each such amount, a Milestone Payment) in accordance with the terms of a Contingent Value Rights Agreement entered into between the Company and American Stock Transfer Trust Company, LLC, as rights agent, as further defined in the CVR agreement. One Milestone Payment is payable (subject to certain terms and conditions) upon the first occurrence of the achievement of aggregate worldwide net sales of GOCOVRI in excess of million during any consecutive period ending on or before December 31, 2024 (Milestone 2024). Another Milestone Payment is payable (subject to certain terms and conditions) upon the first occurrence of the achievement of aggregate worldwide net sales of GOCOVRI in excess of million during any consecutive period ending on or before December 31, 2025 (Milestone 2025 and, together with Milestone 2024, the Milestones). Each Milestone may only be achieved once. The possible outcomes for the contingent consideration range from to million on an undiscounted basis. 
 The key assumptions considered in estimating the fair value of the Adamas sales-based milestones include the estimated revenue projections, volatility, estimated discount rates and risk-free interest rate.

 The Company recorded the following changes in fair value of the contingent consideration liability for the USWM milestones: 
 The Company recorded a million expense and a million expense due to the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities for the USWM milestones for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The change in fair value of contingent consideration for the USWM milestones was primarily due to the change in timing of milestone achievement and estimated discount rate in the third quarter of 2024 and passage of time in both periods. 
 The Company recorded a million expense and a million gain due to the change in the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities for the USWM milestones for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The change in the fair value of contingent consideration for the USWM milestones was primarily driven by the change in estimated fair value of regulatory and developmental milestones due to passage of time in both periods, as well as the change in timing of milestone achievement and estimated discount rate in the first quarter of 2023.

 days' notice. Under the terms of the Development Agreement, the Company and Navitor Inc. will jointly conduct a Phase II clinical program for NV-5138 (SPN-820) for treatment-resistant depression. The Company agreed to bear certain Phase I and Phase II development costs incurred by either party, up to a maximum of million, which amount could be increased under the terms of the Development Agreement upon Navitor s request and the Company s consent. In 2020, the Company paid a one-time, nonrefundable, and non-creditable fee of million for the option to acquire or license NV-5138 (SPN-820) and made a million equity investment representing approximately ownership in Navitor Inc. There are also certain additional payments which could be incurred by the Company that are contingent upon Navitor Inc. achieving defined milestones. These payments include an additional license or acquisition fee depending on whether the Company ultimately licenses or acquires NV-5138 (SPN-820), and subsequent clinical, regulatory and sales milestone payments. The total payments, exclusive of the royalty payments on net sales of NV-5138 (SPN-820) and development costs paid by the Company under the agreement, have the potential to reach million to million, which includes an aggregate upfront payment of million paid in 2020 for the option to acquire or license NV-5138 (SPN-820) and the equity investment, an additional license or acquisition fee depending on whether the Company ultimately licenses or acquires NV-5138 (SPN-820), and subsequent clinical, regulatory and sales based milestone payments. The Company also will have the first right of refusal for any compound with a similar mechanism of action to NV-5138 (SPN-820) on mTORC1 in the central nervous system. 
 In addition to entering into the Development Agreement in April 2020, as above mentioned, the Company acquired Series D Preferred Shares of Navitor Inc. (the Navitor Shares), an equity investment representing an approximately ownership position in Navitor Inc. As part of a legal restructuring in March 2021, the Company's Navitor Inc. Shares were exchanged for membership interests in Navitor Pharmaceutics LLC (Navitor LLC), which became the sole shareholder of Navitor Inc. The Company has determined that although Navitor LLC is a VIE, the Company does not consolidate the results of this VIE into its financial results because the Company lacks the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact Navitor s economic performance. 
 In the second quarter of 2024, the Company consented to payment of additional Phase II development costs for NV-5138 (SPN-820) as they are incurred, but reserves the right to terminate payment of future development costs at its discretion. 
 The maximum exposure to losses related to Navitor LLC includes the approximately million for Phase I and Phase II development of NV-5138 (SPN-820) already paid by the Company, plus the cost of other development and formulation activities provided by the Company and additional Phase II development costs the Company agreed to pay pursuant to the Development Agreement.

million annually, under the contract manufacturing agreement with Merz for manufacture and supply. 
 MDD US Operations, LLC (formerly US WorldMeds, LLC) and its subsidiary, Solstice Neurosciences, LLC (US) (collectively, the MDD Subsidiaries) entered into a Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) with the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services which was effective in April 2019. Under the CIA, the MDD Subsidiaries agreed to and paid million to resolve U.S. Department of Justice allegations that it violated the False Claims Act and committed to the establishment and ongoing maintenance of an effective compliance program. The fine was paid by the MDD Subsidiaries prior to closing of the USWM Acquisition. As part of the USWM Acquisition, the Company assumed the obligations of the CIA and could become liable for payment of certain stipulated monetary penalties in the event of any CIA violations. In addition, the Company continues to maintain a broad array of processes, policies and procedures necessary to comply with the CIA and submitted its final report during the second quarter of 2024. 
 Claims and Litigation 
 From time to time, the Company may be involved in various claims, litigation and legal proceedings. These matters may involve patent litigation, product liability and other product-related litigation, commercial and other matters, and government investigations, among others. On a quarterly basis, the Company reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim, asserted or unasserted, or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, the Company will accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Because of uncertainties related to claims, legal proceedings and litigation, accruals will be based on the Company's best estimates based on available information. The Company does not believe that any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. The Company may reassess the potential liability related to these matters and may revise these estimates. The process of resolving matters through litigation or other means is inherently uncertain and it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of these matters will adversely affect the Company, its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

 On April 1, 2019, Adamas was served with a complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (the District Court) (Case No. 3:18-cv-03018-JCS) against it and several Allergan entities alleging violations of federal and state false claims acts (FCA) in connection with the commercialization of NAMENDA XR and Namzaric by Allergan. The lawsuit is a qui tam complaint brought by an individual, asserting rights of the federal government and various state governments. The lawsuit was originally filed in May 2018 under seal, and Adamas became aware of the lawsuit when it was served. The complaint alleges that patents held by Allergan and Adamas covering NAMENDA XR and Namzaric were procured through fraud on the United States Patent and Trademark Office and that these patents were asserted against potential generic manufacturers of NAMENDA XR and Namzaric to prevent the generic manufacturers from entering the market, thereby wrongfully excluding generic competition resulting in artificially high price being charged to government payors. Adamas' patents in question were licensed exclusively to Forest Laboratories Holdings Limited. The complaint includes a claim for damages of "potentially more than billion dollars," treble damages and statutory penalties. To date the federal and state governments have declined to intervene in this action. This case is currently stayed pending Adamas's and Allergan's interlocutory appeal of the District Court's December 11, 2020 order denying Adamas's and Allergan's motion to dismiss the complaint. The appeal is pending in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (Case No. 21-80005). Argument was held on January 10, 2022. On August 25, 2022, the Ninth Circuit sided with the defendants by reversing the District Court s public disclosure bar rulings and remanding the case back to the District Court to decide certain issues in the first instance. On October 11, 2022, the plaintiff filed a petition for rehearing with the Ninth Circuit which was denied on November 3, 2022. On December 23, 2022, the defendants filed renewed motions to dismiss directed to the remaining unresolved issue. On March 20, 2023, the District Court entered an order and final judgement dismissing with prejudice the FCA claim while declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state false claims act claims which were dismissed without prejudice. On April 19, 2023, the plaintiff appealed the District Court's dismissal of the Federal False Claims Act claim. On February 20, 2024, the plaintiff filed a motion for an indicative ruling and to set aside the judgment in the District Court, based on the same arguments raised in his appeal. That motion was fully briefed and the District Court determined that the motion for an indicative ruling was suitable for determination

Overview 
 We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products for the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Our diverse neuroscience portfolio includes approved treatments for epilepsy, migraine, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), hypomobility in Parkinson s Disease (PD), cervical dystonia, chronic sialorrhea, and dyskinesia in PD patients receiving levodopa-based therapy. We are developing a broad range of novel CNS product candidates including new potential treatments for hypomobility in PD, epilepsy, depression, and other CNS disorders. 
 We have a portfolio of commercial products and product candidates. 
 Commercial Products 
 Qelbree (viloxazine) extended-release capsules is a novel non-stimulant product indicated for the treatment of ADHD in adults and pediatric patients 6 years and older. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Qelbree for the treatment of ADHD in pediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age in April 2021, and in adult patients in April 2022. The Company launched Qelbree for pediatric patients in May 2021 and for adult patients in May 2022 in the United States (U.S.). 
 GOCOVRI (amantadine) extended-release capsules is the first and only FDA approved medicine indicated for the treatment of dyskinesia in patients with PD receiving levodopa-based therapy, with or without concomitant dopaminergic medications, and as an adjunctive treatment to levodopa/carbidopa with PD experiencing "OFF" episodes. 
 Oxtellar XR (oxcarbazepine) is indicated as therapy for the treatment of partial onset seizures in patients 6 years of age and older. It is also the first once-daily extended-release oxcarbazepine product indicated for the treatment of epilepsy in the U.S. market. 
 Trokendi XR (topiramate) is the first once-daily extended-release topiramate product indicated for the treatment of epilepsy in patients 6 years of age and older in the U.S. market. It is also indicated for the prophylaxis of migraine headache in adults and adolescents 12 years and older. 
 APOKYN (apomorphine hydrochloride injection) is a product indicated for the acute, intermittent treatment of hypomobility, "OFF" episodes ("end-of-dose wearing off" and unpredictable "ON/OFF" episodes) in patients with advanced PD. 
 XADAGO (safinamide) is a once-daily product indicated as adjunctive treatment to levodopa/carbidopa in patients with PD experiencing "OFF" episodes. 
 MYOBLOC (rimabotulinumtoxinB injection) is a product indicated for the treatment of cervical dystonia and chronic sialorrhea in adults. It is the only botulinum toxin type B available on the market.

Research and Development 
 We are committed to the development of innovative product candidates in neurology and psychiatry, including the following: 

SPN-830 (apomorphine infusion device) 
 SPN-830 is a late-stage drug/device combination product candidate for the continuous treatment of motor fluctuations ("OFF" episodes) in PD patients that are not adequately controlled with oral levodopa and one or more adjunct PD medications. If approved, it would be the only continuous infusion of apomorphine available in the U.S. and an important step for PD patients that would have otherwise been candidates for potentially invasive surgical procedures, such as deep brain stimulation. Continuous slow infusion may also limit some of the side effects of a bolus injection of apomorphine. 
 In April 2024, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter regarding the NDA for SPN-830. In August 2024, we resubmitted the New Drug Application (NDA) for SPN-830 to the FDA. For further discussion, see Operational Highlights section below. 
 SPN-820 (NV-5138) 
 SPN-820 is a first-in-class, orally active small molecule that increases the brain mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) mediated synaptic function intracellularly. SPN-820 does not bind to or modulate any cell surface receptors and therefore is unlikely to have abuse potential given lack of binding to targets implicated in drug abuse. In addition, unlike leucine, it is not incorporated into proteins during protein synthesis, and therefore, it is more available at the target site in the brain than leucine. 
 SPN-817 (huperzine A) 
 SPN-817 represents a novel mechanism of action (MOA) for an anticonvulsant. SPN-817 is a novel synthetic form of huperzine A, whose MOA includes potent acetylcholinesterase inhibition, with pharmacological activities in CNS conditions such as epilepsy. The development will initially focus on the drug's anticonvulsant activity, which has been shown in preclinical models to be effective for the treatment of partial seizures and Dravet Syndrome. SPN-817 is in clinical development and has received Orphan Drug designation for several epilepsy indications from the FDA. 
 Operational Highlights 
 Total IQVIA prescriptions for Qelbree were 194,025 in the third quarter 2024, an increase of 19 compared to the prior year period. 
 In August 2024, the Company resubmitted to the FDA the NDA for apomorphine infusion device (SPN-830) for the continuous treatment of motor fluctuations ("OFF" episodes) in Parkinson s disease. On August 16, 2024, the FDA

acknowledged the resubmission of the NDA for the apomorphine infusion device (SPN-830). The resubmission is considered filed, with a user fee goal date (PDUFA date) of February 1, 2025. 
 Product Pipeline Update 
 SPN-820 Novel first-in-class molecule that increases mTORC1 mediated synaptic function for depression 
 In October 2024, the Company announced and discussed the data from its exploratory open-label Phase 2a clinical study of SPN-820 in adults with major depressive disorder (MDD). The data were based on 40 enrolled subjects, of which 38 completed the 10-day treatment period. The primary objective of the study was to assess efficacy in MDD, as well as the onset of efficacy. The Phase 2a study demonstrated rapid and substantial decrease in depressive symptoms, and 80 decrease in suicidal ideation. SPN-820 was well-tolerated with few adverse events. 
 In addition, the Company presented new data at the 2024 Psych Congress in October 2024 that demonstrate a rapid Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) response rate 50 reduction) and remission (MADRS 10), reaching 50.0 and 35.0 of participants, respectively, at 4 hours, with additional improvement to 84.2 and 63.2 of participants by Day 10. 
 The Company expects to complete enrollment in the ongoing Phase 2b multi-center randomized double-blind placebo-controlled parallel design study of SPN-820 in adults with treatment-resistant depression in November 2024. The study will examine the efficacy and safety of SPN-820 over a course of five weeks of treatment in approximately 236 patients in approximately 50 clinical sites. The primary outcome measure is the change from baseline to end of treatment period on the MADRS Total Score. Topline data from the Phase 2b trial are expected in the first half of 2025. 
 SPN-817 Novel first-in-class highly selective AChE inhibitor for epilepsy 
 The Company is conducting an open label Phase 2a study in patients with treatment-resistant seizures. In May 2024, the Company announced data from a planned interim analysis from the initial stage of the study (Stage A). The Company has now completed enrollment of Stage A and is reporting topline data from all subjects with focal seizures who received the 3mg and 4mg twice daily doses, completed the maintenance period (n=10), and enrolled in the post-maintenance extension period (n=6). 
 Maintenance period: 
 56 median seizure reduction from baseline. 
 70 of subjects had 30 or more seizure reduction. 
 60 of subjects had 50 or more seizure reduction. 
 30 of subjects had 75 or more seizure reduction. 
 Post-maintenance extension period: 
 66 median seizure reduction from baseline. 
 83 of subjects had 30 or more seizure reduction. 
 67 of subjects had 50 or more seizure reduction. 
 50 of subjects had 75 or more seizure reduction. 
 Seizure Freedom: 
 Maintenance period: 1 out of 10 subjects (10 who completed a post-baseline seizure diary had at least one four-week seizure free period. 
 Post-maintenance extension period: 1 out of 6 subjects (17 had at least one four-week seizure free period. 
 Assessment by EpiTrack , a validated cognitive screening tool designed for patients with epilepsy, indicated that 75 of 16 subjects was equally split between those who improved and those who had no change in cognitive function. 
 SPN-817 was safe and had acceptable tolerability with 2 subjects discontinuing because of treatment related adverse events out of the 26 subjects who entered the maintenance period. Stage B of the study is on-going and includes the concomitant use of an anti-emetic to reduce cholinergic adverse events observed in the study. 
 A Phase 2b randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with treatment resistant focal seizures is expected to start by the end of 2024 studying 3mg and 4mg twice daily doses.

 Results of Operations 
 Comparison of the Three and Nine Months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Revenues 
 Revenues consist primarily of net product sales of our commercial products in the U.S., supplemented by royalty and licensing revenues from our collaborative licensing arrangements. The following table provides information regarding our revenues during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended September 30, Change Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Amount Percent 2024 2023 Amount Percent Net product sales Qelbree 62,359 37,081 25,278 68 166,857 93,840 73,017 78 GOCOVRI 35,657 32,889 2,768 8 93,922 87,650 6,272 7 Oxtellar XR 29,805 29,644 161 1 86,265 82,359 3,906 5 APOKYN 19,867 21,510 (1,643) (8) 53,811 56,324 (2,513) (4) Trokendi XR 15,318 20,625 (5,307) (26) 48,393 74,734 (26,341) (35) Other (1)

 Net Product Sales 
 Net product sales were 170.3 million and 149.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily due to increases in net product sales from Qelbree and GOCOVRI partially offset by the decline in net product sales of Trokendi XR due to generic erosion. 
 Net product sales were 471.3 million and 417.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily due to increases in net product sales from Qelbree and GOCOVRI, partially offset by the decline in net product sales of Trokendi XR due to generic erosion. 
 Sales Deductions and Related Accruals 
 We record accrued product returns and accrued product rebates as current liabilities in Accrued product returns and rebates, on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. We record sales discounts as a reduction against Accounts receivable, net on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. Both amounts are generally affected by changes in gross product sales, changes in the provision for net product sales deductions, and the timing of payments/credits.

 Accrued Product Returns and Rebates 
 The accrued product returns balance increased to 57.4 million as of September 30, 2024 from 54.3 million as of September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to higher net product sales and timing of related return activity offset by the 7.3 million adjustment in the estimated provision for product returns related to prior year sales. The majority of this adjustment is attributable to Qelbree, reflecting favorable actual returns experienced in 2024 for Qelbree. As a result, the Company changed its estimated provision for product returns based on the most recent experience. 
 The accrued product rebates balance increased to 111.7 million as of September 30, 2024 from 108.1 million as of September 30, 2023 due to timing of payments associated with government programs. 
 Provision for Product Returns and Rebates 
 The provision for product returns decreased to 8.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 17.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the aforementioned 7.3 million adjustment in the estimated provision for product returns related to prior year sales. 
 The provision for product rebates decreased to 293.6 million for nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 311.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower Trokendi XR sales, partially offset by higher Qelbree sales and favorability in commercial programs. 
 Royalty, Licensing and Other Revenues 
 Royalty, licensing and other revenues were 5.4 million and 4.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was due to increase in royalty revenues from royalty arrangements with third parties. 
 Royalty, licensing and other revenues were 16.4 million and 25.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to lower royalties on generic Trokendi XR due to the increased number of generic entrants. 
 Cost of Goods Sold 
 28 

Table of Contents 

Cost of goods sold was 17.6 million and 19.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cost of goods sold was 51.8 million and 64.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in both periods was primarily driven by manufacturing efficiencies of Qelbree and a decline in net product sales of Trokendi XR due to generic erosion. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 R D expenses were 29.0 million and 22.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. R D expenses were 80.1 million and 68.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in both periods was primarily due to increased clinical program costs on SPN-817, SPN-820 and on the open-label study of Qelbree, and increased manufacturing costs of our product candidates. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 The following table provides information regarding our selling, general and administrative (SG A) expenses during the periods indicated (dollars in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Change Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Amount Percent 2024 2023 Amount Percent Selling and marketing 54,329 56,785 (2,456) (4) 172,700 173,909 (1,209) (1) General and administrative 15,424 25,915 (10,491) (40) 69,473 81,170 (11,697) (14) Total 69,753 82,700 (12,947) (16) 242,173 255,079 (12,906) (5) 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded 11.5 million and 12.0 million of insurance recoveries for certain legal costs, respectively. Legal costs were recorded under general and administrative expense as incurred. Correspondingly, the insurance recoveries were recorded as a reduction to general and administrative expenses. There were no insurance recoveries recorded in 2023. 
 Amortization of Intangible Assets 
 Amortization of intangible assets was 19.5 million and 21.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Amortization of intangible assets was 59.7 million and 61.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease is primarily due to impairment charges on certain acquired intangible assets in the fourth quarter of 2023 which reduced amortization expense in fiscal year 2024. 
 Contingent Consideration Gain 
 Contingent consideration was a gain of 1.0 million and a gain of 0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Contingent consideration was a gain of 6.5 million and a gain of 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change for both periods was primarily driven by the passage of time for the sales-based milestones associated with the Adamas Acquisition and change in the estimated timeline of achievement of the regulatory and development milestones associated with the USWM Acquisition. See Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Operational Highlights-Product Pipeline Update-SPN-830 (apomorphine infusion device) for treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) . 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 Other income (expense) was an income of 4.1 million and 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Other income (expense) was an income of 11.2 million and 6.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in both periods was due to higher interest income on marketable securities largely driven by an overall higher investment balance in 2024 and no debt outstanding in 2024. The interest expense recognized in 2023 was related to the 2023 Notes which were paid off in April 2023. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 29 

Table of Contents 

Income tax expense was 6.4 million (14.3 effective tax rate) and 13.0 million (18.1 effective tax rate) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to an income tax expense of 25.9 million (261.6 effective tax rate) and 1.6 million (92.1 effective tax rate) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in both periods was primarily due to higher forecasted earnings before taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the near break-even forecasted earnings before taxes in 2023. 
 
 The Company's effective income tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 vary from the statutory federal tax rate in United States (U.S. federal tax rate) of 21 primarily due to increased tax benefits related to current and prior years research and development tax credits. The Company's effective income tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 vary from the statutory U.S. federal tax rate primarily due to near break-even forecasted earnings before taxes. 
 
 The annual forecasted earnings represent the Company's best estimate as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, are subject to change and could have a material impact on the effective tax rate in subsequent periods. Accounting Standard Codification 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740), requires the Company to estimate the annual effective income tax rate for the full year and apply it to pre-tax income (loss) for each interim period, taking into account year-to-date amounts and projected results for the full year. 
 
 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and long-term marketable securities are comprised of the following (dollars in thousands): 
 September 30 December 31 Change 2024 2023 Amount Percent Cash and cash equivalents 31,673 75,054 (43,381) (58) Marketable securities 371,537 179,820 191,717 107 Long-term marketable securities 16,617 (16,617) (100) Total 403,210 271,491 131,719 49 
 We have financed our operations primarily with cash generated from product sales, supplemented by revenues from royalty and licensing arrangements, as well as proceeds from the sale of equity and debt securities. Continued cash generation is highly dependent on the success of our commercial products, as well as the success of our product candidates if approved by the FDA. While we expect continued profitability in future years, we anticipate there may be significant variability from year to year in the level of our profits particularly due to the following: continued market and payor pressures for our commercial products; the unfavorable impact of the loss of patent exclusivity for Trokendi XR in January 2023; the potential unfavorable impact of the loss of exclusivity of Oxtellar XR and XADAGO; funding for research and development of our product candidates; and the additional funding to launch SPN-830, if approved by the FDA. 
 The Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents, and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled 403.2 million as of September 30, 2024, along with cash generated from ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements over the next 12 months and beyond. 
 We may, from time to time, consider raising additional capital through: new collaborative arrangements; strategic alliances; additional equity and/or financings from debt or other sources, especially in conjunction with opportunistic business development initiatives. We will continue to actively manage our capital structure and to consider all financing opportunities that could strengthen our long-term financial profile. Any such capital raises may or may not be similar to transactions in which we have engaged in the past. There can be no assurance that any such financing opportunities will be available on acceptable terms, if at all.

Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Amount Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 127,545 66,127 61,418 Investing activities (177,229) 334,710 (511,939) Financing activities 6,303 (398,972) 405,275 Net change in cash and cash equivalents (43,381) 1,865 (45,246) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year 75,054 93,120 (18,066) Cash and cash equivalents at end of period 31,673 94,985 (63,312) 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 127.5 million and 66.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities is primarily due to higher net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in prior year, and changes in working capital which reflects the timing impacts of cash collections on receivables and settlement of payables. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 177.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 334.7 million cash provided by investing activities during the same period in 2023. The change was primarily due to an increase in cash outflows from purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by higher cash inflows from the maturities of marketable securities. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 6.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 399.0 million used during the same period in 2023. The change was primarily due to the payment of the total principal amounts and remaining outstanding interest due on the 0.625 Convertible Senior Notes in April 2023.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital to fund operations and to facilitate business development activities. We also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant interest rate risk, liquidity risk, or risk of default by investing in investment grade securities with maturities of four years or less. Our exposure to market risk is confined to investments in cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and long-term marketable securities. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and long-term marketable securities of 403.2 million. 
 The Company has a credit line agreement with UBS (the Credit Line) which provides a revolving line of credit of up to 150 million and can be drawn at any time. As of September 30, 2024, there was no outstanding debt under the Credit Line. In the future, we may borrow funds under the Credit Line. Variable rate borrowing, which may occur under the Credit Line, exposes us to interest rate risk as increases in interest rates would increase our borrowing costs.

Table of Contents 

Any borrowed funds pursuant to our Credit Line are subject to a collateral maintenance requirement. The Credit Line is secured primarily by our portfolio of marketable securities, which is primarily comprised of corporate and U.S. government agency and municipal debt securities and may fluctuate in value. The fluctuations may be driven by, among other things, changes in interest rates, economic conditions, and other financial conditions as well as idiosyncratic factors related to a security s issuer. To the extent a fluctuation in value results in the value of the collateral decreasing below the required collateral maintenance requirements we may be required to promptly post additional collateral. Additionally, our Credit Line is an uncommitted facility that may be terminated by the lender at any time. During periods of rapidly changing interest rates, economic conditions or other financial conditions, the Credit Line may be terminated by the lender and/or the lender may declare that all borrowings thereunder are immediately due. 
 Our cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash held at banks and investments in highly liquid financial instruments with an original maturity of three months or less. Our marketable securities, which are reported at fair value, consist of investments in U.S. Treasury bills and notes; bank certificates of deposit; various U.S. governmental agency debt securities; and corporate and municipal debt securities. We place all investments with governmental, industrial, or financial institutions whose debt is rated as investment grade. We generally hold these securities to maturities of one to four years. Because of the relatively short period that we hold our investments and because we generally hold these securities to maturity, we do not believe that an increase in interest rates would have any significant impact on the realizable value of our investments. 
 We do not have any currency or derivative financial instruments. 
 We may contract with clinical research organizations (CROs) and investigational sites globally. Currently, we have ongoing clinical trials being conducted outside the U.S. We do not hedge our foreign currency exchange rate risk. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are recorded based on exchange rates at the time such transactions arise. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, substantially all of our liabilities were denominated in the U.S. dollar. 
 Inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor and the cost of services provided by our vendors. We do not believe that inflation and changing prices over the year ended December 31, 2023, and the nine months ended September 30, 2024 had a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act has been appropriately recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Our management, including our CEO and CFO, evaluated changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, no changes occurred in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Adamas Litigation 
 In November 2012, Adamas Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Adamas) granted Forest Laboratories Holdings Limited, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Allergan plc (Forest), an exclusive license to certain of Adamas's intellectual property rights relating to human therapeutics containing memantine in the United States. Under the terms of that license agreement, Forest has the right to enforce such intellectual property rights which are related to its right to market and sell Namzaric and NAMENDA XR for the treatment of moderate to severe dementia related to Alzheimer's disease. Adamas has a right to participate in, but not control, such enforcement actions by Forest. 
 Since 2018 multiple generic companies have launched generic versions of NAMENDA XR. A number of companies have submitted ANDAs including one or more certifications to the FDA, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(iv), requesting approval to manufacture and market generic versions of Namzaric, on which Adamas became entitled to receive royalties from Forest beginning in May 2020. 
 Adamas and Forest have settled with all such Namzaric ANDA filers, including all first filers on all the available dosage forms of Namzaric. Subject to those agreements, the earliest date on which any of these agreements grant a license to market a Namzaric ANDA filer's generic version of Namzaric is January 1, 2025 (or earlier in certain circumstances). Alternatively, the Namzaric ANDA filers with the earliest date have the option to launch an authorized generic version of Namzaric beginning on January 1, 2026 instead of launching their own generic version of Namzaric on January 1, 2025. Adamas and Forest intend to continue to enforce the patents associated with Namzaric.

Table of Contents 

On April 1, 2019, Adamas was served with a complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (Case No. 3:18-cv-03018-JCS) against it and several Forest and Allergan entities alleging violations of federal and state false claims acts (FCA) in connection with the commercialization of NAMENDA XR and Namzaric by Allergan. The lawsuit is a qui tam complaint brought by a named individual, Zachary Silbersher, asserting rights of the Federal government and various state governments. The lawsuit was originally filed in May 2018 under seal, and Adamas became aware of the lawsuit when it was served. The complaint alleges that patents held by Allergan and Adamas covering NAMENDA XR and Namzaric were procured through fraud on the United States Patent and Trademark Office and that these patents were asserted against potential generic manufacturers of NAMENDA XR and Namzaric to prevent the generic manufacturers from entering the market, thereby wrongfully excluding generic competition resulting in artificially high prices being charged to government payors. 
 Adamas's patents in question were licensed exclusively to Forest. The complaint includes a claim for damages of potentially more than 2.5 billion dollars, treble damages and statutory penalties. To date the federal and state governments have declined to intervene in this action. This case is currently stayed pending Adamas's and Allergan's interlocutory appeal of the District Court's December 11, 2020 order denying Adamas's and Allergan's motions to dismiss the complaint. The appeal was heard by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (Case No. 21-80005). Argument was held on January 10, 2022. On August 25, 2022, the Ninth Circuit sided with the defendants by reversing the District Court s public disclosure bar rulings and remanding the case back to the District Court to decide certain issues in the first instance. On October 11, 2022, the plaintiff filed a petition for rehearing with the Ninth Circuit, which was denied. On December 23, 2022, defendants filed renewed motions to dismiss directed to the remaining unresolved issue. On March 20, 2023, the District Court entered an order and final judgment dismissing with prejudice the FCA claim while declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state false claims act claims which were dismissed without prejudice. On April 19, 2023, the plaintiff appealed the District Court's dismissal of the Federal False Claims Act claim. On February 20, 2024, the plaintiff filed a motion for an indicative ruling and to set aside the judgment in the District Court, based on the same arguments raised in his appeal. That motion was fully briefed and the District Court determined that the motion for an indicative ruling was suitable for determination without a hearing. On May 7, 2024, the District Court denied the plaintiff s motion for an indicative ruling. The appeal is fully briefed, and the Ninth Circuit has set oral argument for November 21, 2024. 
 On December 10, 2019, a putative class action lawsuit alleging violations of the federal securities laws was filed by Ali Zaidi against Adamas and certain of Adamas's former directors and officers in federal court in the Northern District of California (Case No. 4:19-cv-08051). This lawsuit alleges violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by Adamas and certain of Adamas's former directors and officers. On October 8, 2021, the presiding judge dismissed the litigation, and granted Plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint. On November 5, 2021, Plaintiffs filed their second amended class action complaint. On December 10, 2021, Adamas filed a motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint. Plaintiffs opposed the motion to dismiss. On January 13, 2023, the Court granted in part and denied in part Defendants Motion to Dismiss. All claims against Adamas have been dismissed with prejudice, but claims against one of the individual defendants, who may have certain rights to indemnification, remain. On February 27, 2023, Plaintiffs advised the Court that Plaintiffs would proceed only on the remaining claim against one of the individual defendants. The individual defendant filed an answer denying the claim on April 28, 2023. On September 21, 2023, the parties reached an agreement in principle to settle the Zaidi litigation, subject to court approval. On October 31, 2023, the Court granted the parties' stipulation staying all proceedings and vacating all existing deadlines. On April 2, 2024, the Court preliminarily approved the settlement of the case, including a 4.7 million payment from insurers, subject to further consideration at a settlement hearing to be held in September 2024. On September 27, 2024, the Court granted final approval of the class action settlement, dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice, and final judgment was entered. 
 Adamas believes it has strong factual and legal defenses to all actions and intends to defend itself vigorously.
