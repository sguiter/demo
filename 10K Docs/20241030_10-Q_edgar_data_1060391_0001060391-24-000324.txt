 The unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Republic Services, Inc. and its wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). We account for investments in entities in which we do not have a controlling financial interest under the equity method of accounting or, for investments that do not meet the criteria to be accounted for under the equity method, we reflect these investments at their fair value when it is readily determinable. If fair value is not readily determinable, we use an alternative measurement approach. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
 We have prepared these unaudited consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Certain information related to our organization, significant accounting policies and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted. In the opinion of management, these financial statements include all adjustments that, unless otherwise disclosed, are of a normal recurring nature and necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. Operating results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results you can expect for a full year. You should read these financial statements in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 For comparative purposes, certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation and are not material to our consolidated financial statements. All dollar amounts in tabular presentations are in millions, except per share amounts and unless otherwise noted.

million in the joint venture. The investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. 
 In 2024 , we acquired a non-controlling equity interest in a thermal processing facility that treats and recycles contaminated soil, hazardous and non-hazardous waste, and contaminated water to expand our environmental service offering in Canada. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we contributed million in the joint venture. The investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. 
 These investments were recorded as other assets in our unaudited consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 . 
 In 2024 and 2023, we acquired non-controlling equity interests in certain limited liability companies that qualified for investment tax credits under Section 48 of the Internal Revenue Code. In exchange for our non-controlling interests, we made capital contributions of million and million, which were recorded to other assets in our September 30, 2024 and 2023 unaudited consolidated balance sheets, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we decreased the carrying value of these investments by recognizing losses of million and million, respectively, and during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we decreased the carrying value of these investments by recognizing losses of million and million, respectively, as a result of cash distributions and our share of income and loss pursuant to the terms of the limited liability company agreements . Additionally, our tax provisions reflect benefits of million and million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to the tax credits related to these investments, compared to benefits of million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. For further discussion of the income tax benefits, refer to Note 11, Income Taxes, in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 We review annually, in the fourth quarter, and update as necessary, our estimates of asset retirement obligation liabilities. However, if there are significant changes in the facts and circumstances related to a site during the year, we will update our assumptions prospectively in the period that we know all the relevant facts and circumstances and make adjustments as appropriate. 
 Landfill Operating Expenses 
 In the normal course of business, we incur various operating costs associated with environmental compliance. These costs include, among other things, leachate treatment and disposal, methane gas and groundwater monitoring, systems maintenance, interim cap maintenance, costs associated with the application of daily cover materials, and the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance. These costs are expensed as cost of operations in the periods in which they are incurred. 
 Environmental Remediation Liabilities 
 We accrue for remediation costs when they become probable and can be reasonably estimated. There can sometimes be a range of reasonable estimates of the costs associated with remediation of a site. In these cases, we use the amount within the range that constitutes our best estimate. If no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other, we use the amount that is at the low end of such range. It is reasonably possible that we will need to adjust the liabilities recorded for remediation to reflect the effects of new or additional information, to the extent such information impacts the costs, timing or duration of the required actions. If we used the reasonably possible high ends of our ranges, our aggregate potential remediation liability as of September 30, 2024 would be approximately million higher than the amount recorded. Future changes in our estimates of the cost, timing or duration of the required actions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

 Bridgeton Landfill. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid million related to management and monitoring of the remediation area for our closed Bridgeton Landfill in Missouri. We continue to work with state and federal regulatory agencies on our remediation efforts. From time to time, this may require us to modify our future operating timeline and procedures, which could result in changes to our expected liability. As of September 30, 2024, the remediation liability recorded for this site was million, of which approximately million is expected to be paid during the remainder of 2024. 
 West Lake Landfill Superfund Site . Our subsidiary Bridgeton Landfill, LLC is one of several currently designated Potentially Responsible Parties for the West Lake Landfill Superfund site (West Lake) in Missouri. On September 27, 2018, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a Record of Decision Amendment for West Lake that includes a total undiscounted cost estimate of million over a four to design and construction timeline. On March 11, 2019, the EPA issued special notice letters under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) to Bridgeton Landfill, LLC and the other currently designated Potentially Responsible Parties to initiate negotiations to implement the remedy. At this time we are neither able to predict the final design of that remedy, nor estimate how much of the future response costs of the site our subsidiary may agree or be required to pay. During any subsequent administrative proceedings or litigation, our subsidiary will vigorously contest liability for the costs of remediating radiologically-impacted materials generated on behalf of the federal government during the Manhattan Project and delivered to the site by an Atomic Energy Commission licensee and its subcontractor. Currently, we believe we are adequately reserved for our expected remediation liability. However, subsequent events related to remedy design, divisibility, or allocation may require us to modify our expected remediation liability.

million of borrowings outstanding under our Uncommitted Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2023, we had borrowings outstanding under our Uncommitted Credit Facility. 
 The Credit Facility 
 In July 2024, we and our subsidiary, USE Canada Holdings, Inc. (the Canadian Borrower) entered into the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Facility) which amends and restates the unsecured revolving credit facility we entered into in August 2021. The total outstanding principal amount that we may borrow under the Credit Facility may not exceed the current aggregate lenders' commitments of billion, and borrowings under the Credit Facility mature in July 2029. As permitted by the Credit Facility, we have the right to request extensions of the maturity date, but none of the lenders are committed to participate in such extensions. The Credit Facility also includes a feature that allows us to increase availability, at our option, by an aggregate amount of up to billion through increased commitments from existing lenders or the addition of new lenders. 
 All loans to the Canadian Borrower and all loans denominated in Canadian dollars cannot exceed billion (the Canadian Sublimit). The Canadian Sublimit is part of, and not in addition to, the aggregate commitments under the Credit Facility. 
 Borrowings under the Credit Facility in United States dollars bear interest at a Base Rate, a daily floating SOFR or a term SOFR plus a current applicable margin of based on our Debt Ratings (all as defined in the Credit Facility agreement). The Canadian dollar-denominated loans bear interest based on the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, C million and C million, respectively, were outstanding against the Canadian Sublimit. The weighted average interest rate for borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2024 was . 
 The Credit Facility is subject to facility fees based on applicable rates defined in the Credit Facility agreement and the aggregate commitment, regardless of usage. The Credit Facility can be used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, letters of credit and other general corporate purposes. The Credit Facility agreement requires us to comply with financial and other covenants. We may pay dividends and repurchase common stock if we are in compliance with these covenants. 
 We had million and million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We had million and million of letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We also had million and million of principal borrowings outstanding (net of related discount on issuance) under the commercial paper program as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As a result, availability under our Credit Facility was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Term Loan Facility 
 On April 29, 2022, we entered into a billion term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility) which bore interest at a base rate or a forward-looking SOFR, plus an applicable margin based on our debt ratings. We had million of borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan Facility as of December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repaid the remaining balance of the Term Loan Facility. 
 Commercial Paper Program 
 We have entered into a commercial paper program for the issuance and sale of unsecured commercial paper in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed billion outstanding at any one time. The weighted average interest rate for borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2024 was with a weighted average maturity of days. 
 We had million and million in aggregate principal amount of commercial paper issued and outstanding under the program as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In the event of a failed re-borrowing, we currently have availability under our Credit Facility to fund the commercial paper program until it is re-borrowed successfully. Accordingly, we have classified these borrowings as long-term in our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024.

million of senior notes due 2029 (the Existing 2029 Notes) and million of senior notes due 2034. We used the proceeds from the March 2023 notes issuance for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of a portion of amounts outstanding under the Uncommitted Credit Facility, the Commercial Paper Program, the Credit Facility, and the Term Loan Facility. As a result of the Term Loan Facility repayment, we incurred a non-cash loss on the early extinguishment of debt related to the ratable portion of unamortized deferred issuance costs of million. 
 In December 2023, we issued an additional million of senior notes due 2029 (the New 2029 Notes, and together with the Existing 2029 Notes, the 2029 Notes). After giving effect to the issuance of the New 2029 Notes, million in aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Notes is outstanding. The New 2029 Notes are fungible with the Existing 2029 Notes, and taken together, the 2029 Notes are treated as a single series. 
 In December 2023, we also issued million of senior notes due 2033. The proceeds of the December 2023 notes issuance were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of a portion of amounts outstanding under the Uncommitted Credit Facility, the Commercial Paper Program, the Credit Facility, and the Term Loan Facility. 
 In June 2024, we issued million of senior notes due 2029 and million of senior notes due 2034. We used the proceeds from the June 2024 notes issuance for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of a portion of amounts outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program and the Credit Facility; and repayment of the remaining amount outstanding under the Term Loan Facility and the Uncommitted Credit Facility. 
 Our senior notes and debentures are general unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured obligations. 
 Interest Rate Swap and Lock Agreements 
 Our ability to obtain financing through the capital markets is a key component of our financial strategy. Historically, we have managed risk associated with executing this strategy, particularly as it relates to fluctuations in interest rates, by using a combination of fixed and floating rate debt. From time to time, we also have entered into interest rate swap and lock agreements to manage risk associated with interest rates, either to effectively convert specific fixed rate debt to a floating rate (fair value hedges), or to lock interest rates in anticipation of future debt issuances (cash flow hedges). 
 Cash Flow Hedges 
 We have historically entered into multiple swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates in anticipation of planned future issuances of senior notes. Upon the expected issuance of senior notes, we terminate the interest rate locks and settle with our counterparties. These transactions are accounted for as cash flow hedges. 
 The fair value of our interest rate locks is determined using standard valuation models with assumptions about interest rates being based on those observed in underlying markets (Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy). 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized an unrealized gain in other comprehensive loss of million, net of tax, related to terminated interest rate locks issued in conjunction with the issuance of our notes in March 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our previously terminated interest rate locks were recorded as components of accumulated other comprehensive loss of million and million, respectively, net of tax. The effective portion of the interest rate locks is amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the issued debt using the effective interest method. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized losses, net of tax, of million and million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized losses, net of tax, of million and million, respectively. Over the next 12 months, we expect to amortize million, net of tax, from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense as a yield adjustment of our senior notes. 
 In connection with our acquisition of US Ecology, in the second quarter of 2022, we acquired and novated a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap agreement (the 2022 Interest Rate Swap) with an initial effective date of March 6, 2020, an initial notional amount of million relative to our Term Loan Facility and an initial fair value of million. The initial fair value was reclassified into earnings as non-cash interest expense on a systematic basis over the life of the interest rate swap. In June 2024, we terminated the 2022 Interest Rate Swap and received million in conjunction with this settlement. As of December 31, 2023, the 2022 Interest Rate Swap was recorded at its fair value of million and was included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized unrealized gains of million in accumulated other comprehensive income for the 2022 Interest Rate Swap. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized unrealized gains of million and million, respectively, in accumulated other comprehensive income for the

million, net of tax. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized gains, net of tax, of million. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized gains, net of tax, of million and million, respectively, related to this amortization. 
 For further detail regarding the effect of our cash flow hedging on interest expense, refer to Note 11, Financial Instruments , of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Derivative Contracts 
 Contemporaneously with the issuance of our notes in February 2020, we amended interest rate lock agreements with an aggregate notional value of million, extending the mandatory maturity date from 2020 to 2030, and dedesignated them as cash flow hedges (2020 Extended Interest Rate Locks). Contemporaneously with the issuance of our notes in August 2019, we amended interest rate lock agreements with an aggregate notional value of million, extending the mandatory maturity date from 2019 to 2024, and dedesignated them as cash flow hedges (2019 Extended Interest Rate Locks and collectively with the 2020 Extended Interest Rate Locks, the Extended Interest Rate Locks). There was no ineffectiveness recognized in the termination of these cash flow hedges. In addition, we entered into interest rate swaps to offset future exposures to fair value fluctuations of the Extended Interest Rate Locks (2019 Offsetting Interest Rate Swap and the 2020 Offsetting Interest Rate Swap, or collectively the Offsetting Interest Rate Swaps). In September 2024, the 2019 Extended Interest Rate Locks fully matured. The fair value of these free-standing derivatives was determined using standard valuation models with assumptions about interest rates being based on those observed in underlying markets (Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy). 
 As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the 2020 Extended Interest Rate Locks were assets of million, which were included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheet and the fair value of the 2020 Offsetting Interest Rate Swap were liabilities of million, which were included in other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of the Extended Interest Rate Locks were assets of million, which were included in prepaids and other current assets and other assets in our consolidated balance sheet and the fair value of the Offsetting Interest Rate Swaps were liabilities of million, which were included in other accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized losses of million and gains of million, respectively, on the change in fair value of the Extended Interest Rate Locks with offsetting gains of million and losses of million, respectively, on the change in fair value of the Offsetting Interest Rate Swaps. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized losses of million and gains of million, respectively, on the change in fair value of the Extended Interest Rate Locks with offsetting gains of million and losses of million, respectively, on the change in fair value of the Offsetting Interest Rate Swaps. The changes in fair value were recorded directly in earnings as an adjustment to interest expense in our consolidated statements of income. 
 Tax-Exempt Financings 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had million and million, respectively, of certain fixed and variable rate tax-exempt financings outstanding, with maturities ranging from 2026 to 2054 and from 2024 to 2053, respectively. 
 In June 2024, the Mission Economic Development Corporation issued, for our benefit, million in principal amount of Solid Waste Disposal Revenue Bonds. The proceeds from the issuance, after deferred issuance costs, were used to fund the acquisition, construction, improvement, installation, and/or equipping of certain solid waste disposal facilities located within Texas. 
 In both March 2024 and September 2023, the California Municipal Finance Authority issued, for our benefit, million in principal amount of Solid Waste Disposal Revenue Bonds. The proceeds from the issuances, after deferred issuance costs, were used to fund the acquisition, construction, improvement, installation, and/or equipping of certain solid waste disposal facilities located within California. 
 The initial remarketing period for these tax-exempt financings is years. Our remaining tax-exempt financings are remarketed either quarterly or semiannually by remarketing agents to effectively maintain a variable yield. The holders of the bonds can put them back to the remarketing agents at the end of each interest period. If the remarketing agents are unable to remarket our bonds, the remarketing agents can put the bonds to us. In the event of a failed remarketing, we currently have availability under our Credit Facility to fund these bonds until they are remarketed successfully. Accordingly, we classified these borrowings as long-term in our consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 and , respectively. Our effective tax rate, exclusive of non-controlling interests, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was and , respectively. Our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflects a benefit of million and million, respectively, due to our investments in renewable energy assets qualifying for tax credits under Section 48 of the Internal Revenue Code, million due to the realization of additional federal and state benefits, as well as adjustments to deferred taxes due to the completion of our 2023 tax returns. 
 
 Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 reflected benefits of million from tax settlements, million from investments in solar energy assets qualifying for federal tax credits under Section 48 of the Internal Revenue Code, million due to the realization of additional federal and state benefits, as well as adjustments to deferred taxes due to the completion of our 2022 tax returns. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash paid for income taxes was million and million, respectively. 
 We have deferred tax assets related to state net operating loss carryforwards. We provide a partial valuation allowance due to uncertainty surrounding the future utilization of these carryforwards in the taxing jurisdictions where the loss carryforwards exist. When determining the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all positive and negative evidence, including recent financial results, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies. The realization of our deferred tax asset for state loss carryforwards ultimately depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income in the appropriate state taxing jurisdictions in future periods. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent such evidence can be objectively verified. We continue to regularly monitor both positive and negative evidence in determining the ongoing need for a valuation allowance. As of September 30, 2024, the valuation allowance associated with our state loss carryforwards was million. 
 We are subject to income tax in the United States, as well as income tax in multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. Our compliance with income tax rules and regulations is periodically audited by taxing authorities. These authorities may challenge the positions taken in our tax filings. Thus, to provide for certain potential tax exposures, we maintain liabilities for uncertain tax positions for our estimate of the final outcome of these examinations. Our federal statute of limitations is closed through 2020. The federal statu t e of limitations applicable to an acquired subsidiary is closed through 2019. In addition, we are currently under state examination or administrative review in various jurisdictions for tax years 2012 through 2022. 
 We believe the recorded liabilities for uncertain tax positions are adequate. However, a significant assessment against us in excess of the liabilities recorded could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. As of September 30, 2024, we are unable to estimate the resolution of our gross unrecognized benefits over the next 12 months. 
 We recognize interest and penalties as incurred within the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statement of income. As of September 30, 2024, we accrued a liability for penalties of million and a liability for interest (including interest on penalties) of million related to our uncertain tax positions.

As of September 30, 2024, we recorded a quarterly dividend payable of million to shareholders of record at the close of business on October 2, 2024. 
 Earnings per Share 
 Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to Republic Services, Inc. by the weighted average number of common shares (including vested but unissued restricted stock units and performance stock units) outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is based on the combined weighted average number of common shares and common share equivalents outstanding, which include, where appropriate, the unvested restricted stock units (RSUs) and the unvested performance stock units (PSUs) at the expected attainment levels. We use the treasury stock method in computing diluted earnings per share.

 Fair Value Measurements 
 In measuring fair values of assets and liabilities, we use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs (Level 1) and minimize the use of unobservable inputs (Level 3). We also use market data or assumptions that we believe market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk when appropriate.

 Other non-core revenue consists primarily of revenue from National Accounts, which represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide or regional contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated material handling is subcontracted to local operators. Consequently, substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs, which are recorded in cost of operations. 
 See Note 12, Segment Reporting , for additional information regarding revenue by reportable segment. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Our service obligations of a long-term nature, e.g., certain collection service contracts, are satisfied over time, and we recognize revenue based on the value provided to the customer during the period. The amount billed to the customer is based on variable elements such as the number of residential homes or businesses for which collection services are provided, the volume of material collected, treated, transported and disposed, and the nature of the material accepted. We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for these contracts as our right to consideration corresponds directly to the value provided to the customer for services completed to date and all future variable consideration is allocated to wholly unsatisfied performance obligations. 
 Additionally, certain elements of our long-term customer contracts are unknown upon entering into the contract, including the amount that will be billed in accordance with annual price escalation clauses, our fuel recovery fee program and commodity prices. The amount to be billed is often tied to changes in an underlying base index such as a consumer price index or a fuel or commodity index, and revenue can be recognized once the index is established for the period. 
 Environmental solutions revenue is primarily generated from the fees we charge for the collection, treatment, consolidation, disposal and recycling of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, field and industrial services, equipment rental, emergency response and standby services and in-plant services, such as transportation and logistics, including at our transfer, storage and disposal facilities (TSDF). Activity for this service line varies across markets and reflects the regulatory environment, pricing and disposal alternatives available in any given market. Revenue recognized is variable in nature and primarily based on the volume and type of waste accepted or processed during the period. For certain field and industrial services contracts, we have a right to consideration from our customers in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the

million and million, respectively, of deferred contract costs and capitalized sales commissions. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we amortized million and million, respectively, of capitalized sales commissions to selling, general and administrative expenses and we amortized million and million, respectively, of other deferred contract costs as a reduction of revenue. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we amortized million and million, respectively, of capitalized sales commissions to selling, general and administrative expenses and we amortized million and million, respectively, of other deferred contract costs as a reduction of revenue. 
 Credit Losses 
 Accounts receivable represent receivables from customers for environmental services, including collection and processing of recyclable materials, collection, transfer, and disposal of solid waste, and other environmental solutions. Our receivables are recorded when billed or when the related revenue is earned and represent claims against third parties that will be settled in cash. The carrying value of our receivables, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts and customer credits, represents their estimated net realizable value. 
 We establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on various factors including the age of receivables outstanding, historical trends, economic conditions and other information. We also review outstanding balances on an account-specific basis based on the credit risk of the customer. We determined that all of our accounts receivable share similar risk characteristics. We monitor our credit exposure on an ongoing basis and assess whether assets in the pool continue to display similar risk characteristics. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers, but generally do not require collateral to support customer receivables.

million relating to our outstanding legal proceedings as of September 30, 2024. As of the end of each applicable reporting period, we review each of our legal proceedings and, where it is probable that a liability has been incurred, we accrue for all probable and reasonably estimable losses. Where we can reasonably estimate a range of losses we may incur regarding such a matter, we record an accrual for the amount within the range that constitutes our best estimate. If we can reasonably estimate a range but no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other, we use the amount that is the low end of such range. If we had used the high ends of such ranges, our aggregate potential liability would be approximately million higher than the amount recorded as of September 30, 2024. 
 Multiemployer Pension Plans 
 We participate in multiemployer pension plans that generally provide retirement benefits to participants of contributing employers. We do not administer these plans. 
 Under current law regarding multiemployer pension plans, our withdrawal (which we consider from time to time) or the mass withdrawal from any under-funded multiemployer pension plan (each, a Withdrawal Event) could require us to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the plan s unfunded vested liabilities. During the course of operating our business, we incur Withdrawal Events regarding certain of the multiemployer pension plans in which we participate. We accrue for such events when losses become probable and reasonably estimable.

 Overview 
 Republic is one of the largest providers of environmental services in the United States, as measured by revenue. As of September 30, 2024, we operated across the United States and Canada through 361 collection operations, 247 transfer stations, 75 recycling centers, 208 active landfills, 2 treatment, recovery and disposal facilities, 23 treatment, storage and disposal facilities (TSDF), 5 salt water disposal wells 12 deep injection wells, and 1 polymer center. We are engaged in 78 landfill gas-to-energy and renewable energy projects and had post-closure responsibility for 126 closed landfills as of September 30, 2024. 
 Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 7.7 to 11,986.0 million compared to 11,132.9 million for the same period in 2023. This change in revenue is due to increases in average yield of 5.4 , increased revenue from acquisitions, net of divestitures of 3.1 , and an increase in recycling processing and commodity sales of 0.5 . Additionally, revenue increased 0.1 due to the impact of the number of workdays during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in volume of 1.0 , a decrease in environmental solutions revenue of 0.2 , and a decrease in fuel recovery fees of 0.2 .

 We believe that presenting adjusted pre-tax income, adjusted tax impact, adjusted net income Republic, and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which are not measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, provides an understanding of operational activities before the financial impact of certain items. We use these measures, and believe investors will find them helpful, in understanding the ongoing performance of our operations separate from items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period. We have incurred comparable charges, costs and recoveries in prior periods, and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods. Our definitions of adjusted pre-tax income, adjusted tax impact, adjusted net income Republic, and adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Further information on each of these adjustments is included below. 
 (Gain) loss on extinguishment of debt and other related costs. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a loss of 2.4 million due to the amendment and restatement of the Credit Facility. Additionally, we recorded a net gain of 7.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, attributable to the early settlement of certain cash flow hedges related to the Term Loan Facility. The gain was recognized as a reduction of interest expense. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred a loss on the early extinguishment of debt related to the early repayment of a portion of our Term Loan Facility. We incurred non-cash charges related to the proportional share of unamortized deferred issuance costs of 0.2 million. 
 Restructuring charges. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we incurred restructuring charges of 8.2 million and 19.7 million, respectively, and during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred restructuring charges of 6.3 million and 27.3 million , respectively . The 2024 charges primarily related to the redesign of our asset management, and customer and order management software systems. Of the 2023 charges, 9.5 million related to the early termination of certain leases and 17.8 million related to the redesign of our asset management, and customer and order management software systems. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we paid 18.1 million and 32.4 million, respectively, related to these restructuring efforts. 
 During the remainder of 2024, we expect to incur additional restructuring charges of approximately 10 million , primarily related to the continued redesign of our asset management, and customer and order management software systems. Substantially all of these restructuring charges will be recorded in Corporate entities and other. 
 Loss (gain) on business divestitures and impairments, net. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a net loss on business divestitures and impairments of 0.5 million and a net gain on business divestitures and impairments of 0.9 million, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a net gain on business divestitures and impairments of 1.5 million. 
 Settlements and withdrawals on pension plans. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a settlement of our defined benefit pension plan. The settlement included a combination of lump-sum payments to participants who elected to receive them and the transfer of benefit obligations to a third-party insurance company under a group annuity contract. As a result of the settlements, we recognized a non-cash gain of 7.4 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to the accelerated recognition of the proportional share of unamortized net actuarial gains in accumulated other comprehensive loss. We expect to settle all remaining obligations by the end of 2024.

 US Ecology, Inc. acquisition integration and deal costs . During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred acquisition integration and deal costs of 6.2 million and 24.3 million, respectively, in connection with the acquisition of US Ecology, which included certain costs to integrate the business. The acquisition closed on May 2, 2022. Our integration of the business was substantially complete as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 We generate revenue by providing environmental services to our customers, including the collection and processing of recyclable materials, the collection, treatment, consolidation, transfer and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste and other environmental solutions. Our residential, small-container and large-container collection operations in some markets are based on long-term contracts with municipalities. Certain of our municipal contracts have annual price escalation clauses that are tied to changes in an underlying base index such as a consumer price index. We generally provide small-container and large-container collection services to customers under contracts with terms up to three years. Our transfer stations and landfills generate revenue from disposal or tipping fees charged to third parties. Our recycling centers generate revenue from tipping fees charged to third parties and the sale of recycled commodities. Our revenue from environmental solutions primarily consists of (1) fees we charge for the collection, treatment, transfer and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, (2) field and industrial services, (3) equipment rental, (4) emergency response and standby services, (5) in-plant services, such as transportation and logistics, including at our TSDFs and (6) in-plant services such as high-pressure cleaning, tank cleaning, decontamination, remediation, transportation, spill cleanup and emergency response at refineries, chemical, steel and automotive plants and other governmental, commercial and industrial facilities. Other non-core revenue consists primarily of revenue from National Accounts, which represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide or regional contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated material handling is subcontracted to local operators. Consequently, substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs, which are recorded in cost of operations. The following table reflects our revenue by service line for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue): Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Collection: Residential

 The following table reflects changes in components of our revenue, as a percentage of total revenue, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Average yield 4.6 5.8 5.4 6.1 Fuel recovery fees (0.2) (1.1) (0.2) (0.2) Total price 4.4 4.7 5.2 5.9 Volume (1.2) 0.1 (1.0) 0.7 Change in workdays 0.3 (0.4) 0.1 Recycling processing and commodity sales 0.7 (0.2) 0.5 (0.8) Environmental solutions 0.4 (0.2) 0.4 Total internal growth 4.2 4.6 4.6 6.2 Acquisitions / divestitures, net 2.3 1.7 3.1 5.3 Total 6.5 6.3 7.7 11.5 Core price 6.2 7.0 6.6 7.5 
 Average yield is defined as revenue growth from the change in average price per unit of service, expressed as a percentage. Core price is defined as price increases to our customers and fees, excluding fuel recovery fees, net of price decreases to retain customers. We also measure changes in core price, average yield and volume as a percentage of related-business revenue, defined as total revenue excluding recycled commodities, fuel recovery fees and environmental solutions revenue, to determine the effectiveness of our pricing and organic growth strategies. 
 The following table reflects core price, average yield and volume as a percentage of related-business revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 As a of Related Business As a of Related Business Core price 7.4 8.6 8.0 8.9 Average yield 5.5 7.2 6.5 7.2 Volume (1.5) 0.1 (1.2) 0.8 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we experienced the following changes in our revenue as compared to the same period in 2023: 
 Average yield increased revenue by 4.6 and 5.4 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, due to positive pricing changes in all lines of business. 
 The fuel recovery fee program, which mitigates our exposure to changes in fuel prices, decreased revenue by 0.2 for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, due to a decrease in fuel prices compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 Volume decreased revenue by 1.2 and 1.0 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The decline in revenue in our large-container collection line of business was primarily driven by a slowing in construction-related activity. The decline in our residential and small-container lines of business is primarily attributable to certain municipal contract losses and broker-related business. 
 The decline in volume in our landfill line of business is primarily attributable to decreased special waste volumes, partially offset by increased solid waste volumes. 
 Revenue increased by 0.3 and 0.1 due to the impact of the number of workdays during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023, which drove an increase in volume across all lines of business. 
 Recycling processing and commodity sales increased revenue by 0.7 and 0.5 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily due to an increase in overall commodity prices as compared to the same periods in 2023. The average price for recycled commodities at our recycling centers, excluding glass and

Table of Contents 

 organics, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 177 and 168 per ton, respectively, compared to 112 per ton for the same periods in 2023. 
 Changing market demand for recycled commodities causes volatility in commodity prices. At current volumes and mix of materials, we believe a 10 per ton change in the price of recycled commodities would change both annual revenue and operating income by approximately 10 million. 
 Environmental solutions decreased revenue by 0.2 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a reduction in E P disposal volumes which were impacted by a decline in oil rig counts, and lower event-based volumes relative to the same period in 2023, partially offset by price increases. 
 Acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased revenue by 2.3 and 3.1 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, reflecting the results of our continued growth strategy of acquiring environmental services companies that complement and expand our existing business platform. 
 Cost of Operations 
 Cost of operations includes labor and related benefits, which consists of salaries and wages, health and welfare benefits, incentive compensation and payroll taxes. It also includes transfer and disposal costs representing tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities and transfer stations; maintenance and repairs relating to our vehicles, equipment and containers, including related labor and benefit costs; transportation and subcontractor costs, which include costs for independent haulers that transport our waste to disposal facilities and costs for local operators that provide waste handling services associated with our National Accounts in markets outside our standard operating areas; fuel, which includes the direct cost of fuel used by our vehicles, net of fuel tax credits; disposal fees and taxes, consisting of landfill taxes, host community fees and royalties; landfill operating costs, which includes financial assurance, leachate disposal, remediation charges and other landfill maintenance costs; risk management costs, which include insurance premiums and claims; cost of goods sold, which includes material costs paid to suppliers; and other, which includes expenses such as facility operating costs, equipment rent and gains or losses on sale of assets used in our operations. 
 The following table summarizes the major components of our cost of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue): Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Labor and related benefits 813.7 20.0 744.1 19.4 2,412.3 20.1 2,233.0 20.1 Transfer and disposal costs 280.2 6.9 268.7 7.0 832.3 7.0 788.6 7.1 Maintenance and repairs 379.8 9.3 357.6 9.3 1,105.6 9.2 1,036.1 9.3 Transportation and subcontract costs

 These cost categories may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories presented by other companies. As such, you should take care when comparing our cost of operations by component to that of other companies and of ours for prior periods. 
 The most significant items impacting our cost of operations during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are summarized below: 
 Labor and related benefits increased due to higher hourly and salaried wages as a result of annual merit increases. Acquisition-related growth also contributed to the increase in labor and related benefits. 
 Transfer and disposal costs increased in aggregate dollars primarily due to acquisition activity and higher disposal rates. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , approximately 67 of the total solid waste volume we collected was disposed at landfill sites that we owned or operated (internalization), as compared to 68 for the same periods in 2023 . 
 36 

Table of Contents 

 Maintenance and repairs expense increa se d in aggregate dollars due to higher hourly wages as a result of annual merit increases, an increase in third-party maintenance, and parts inflation. Acquisition-related growth also contributed to the increase in maintenance and repairs expense. 
 Our fuel costs decreased due to a decrease in the average diesel fuel price per gallon. The national average diesel fuel price per gallon for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.69 and 3.83, respectively, as compared to 4.24 and 4.20, respectively, for the same periods in 2023. 
 At current consumption levels, we believe a twenty-cent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel would change our fuel costs by approximately 27 million per year. Offsetting these changes in fuel expense would be changes in our fuel recovery fee charged to our customers. At current participation rates, a twenty-cent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel would change our fuel recovery fee by approximately 36 million per year. 
 Landfill operating costs increased primarily due to increased leachate transportation and maintenance on our gas extraction systems due in part to increased rainfall in select geographic regions. 
 Risk management expenses increased in aggregate dollars primarily due to higher premium costs as well as unfavorable claims development in our auto liability program, partially offset by favorable claims development in our general and worker's compensation liability programs. 
 Other costs of operations increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to increased occupancy and facility related expenses as well as acquisition-related growth. These increases were partially offset by a favorable non-recurring insurance recovery related to a prior year claim. 
 Depreciation, Amortization and Depletion of Property and Equipment 
 The following table summarizes depreciation, amortization and depletion of property and equipment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue): Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment

 382.5 9.4 349.0 9.1 1,122.2 9.4 1,004.2 9.0 
 Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to assets added through acquisitions. 
 Landfill depletion and amortization expense increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to an increase in our overall average depletion rate. 
 Amortization of Other Intangible Assets 
 Amortization of other intangible assets primarily relates to customer relationships and, to a lesser extent, non-compete agreements. Expenses for amortization of other intangible assets were 17.8 million and 54.3 million, or 0.4 of revenue, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 17.3 million and 47.4 million, or 0.5 and 0.4 of revenue, respectively, for the same periods in 2023. Amortization expense increased due to assets added through acquisition activity. 
 Amortization of Other Assets 
 Our other assets primarily relate to the prepayment of fees and capitalized implementation costs associated with cloud-based hosting arrangements. Expenses for amortization of other assets were 21.7 million and 57.7 million, or 0.6 and 0.5 of revenue, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 16.0 million and 47.8 million, or 0.4 of revenue for the same periods in 2023. Amortization expense increased due to an increase in fees for cloud-based hosting arrangements. 
 Accretion Expense 
 Accretion expense was 26.7 million and 80.1 million, or 0.7 of revenue, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 24.6 million and 73.2 million, or 0.6 and 0.7 of revenue, respectively, for the same periods in 2023.

As such, you should take care when comparing our selling, general and administrative expenses by cost component to those of other companies and of ours for prior periods. 
 The most significant items affecting our selling, general and administrative expenses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are summarized below: 
 Salaries and related benefits increased primarily due to higher wages and benefits resulting from annual merit increases as well as acquisition-related growth. 
 Provision for doubtful accounts decreased primarily due to improvements in our cash collections and days sales outstanding as well as a favorable adjustment to a reserve established in a prior year. As of September 30, 2024 , our days sales outstanding were 41.2, or 30.4 days net of deferred revenue, compared to 43.5, or 32.0 days net of deferred revenue, as of September 30, 2023. 
 Other selling, general and administrative expenses increased in aggregate dollars for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to an increase in professional fees and acquisition-related growth. The increase in other selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was partially offset by a favorable legal settlement recognized during the period. 
 We incurred various acquisition integration and deal costs in connection with the acquisition of US Ecology. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, these charges totaled 6.2 million and 24.3 million, respectively. The 2023 costs primarily related to the integration of certain software systems as well as rebranding of the business. The acquisition closed on May 2, 2022. Our integration of the business was substantially complete as of December 31, 2023. 
 Loss (Gain) on Business Divestitures and Impairments, Net 
 We strive to have a number one or number two market position in each of the markets we serve, or have a clear path on how we will achieve a leading market position over time. Where we cannot establish a leading market position, or where operations are not generating acceptable returns, we may decide to divest of certain assets and reallocate resources to other markets. Business divestitures could result in gains, losses or impairment charges that may be material to our results of operations in a given period. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a net loss (gain) on business divestitures and impairments of 0.5 million and (0.9) million, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 we recognized a net gain on business divestitures and impairments of 1.5 million. 
 Restructuring Charges

 Interest Expense 
 The following table provides the components of interest expense, including accretion of debt discounts and accretion of discounts primarily associated with environmental and risk insurance liabilities assumed in acquisitions, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in millions of dollars): Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Interest expense on debt 
 121.2 108.6 357.2 317.1 Non-cash interest 19.1 20.4 54.0 65.5 Less: capitalized interest (2.1) (1.4) (5.4) (3.8) Total interest expense 138.2 127.6 405.8 378.8 
 Total interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased primarily due to an increase in the overall principal balance of our fixed rate debt portfolio as a result of issuances of new senior notes and tax-exempt financings. This increase was partially offset by a gain of 7.8 million recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 attributable to the early settlement of certain cash flow hedges related to the Term Loan Facility. The gain was recognized as a reduction of non-cash interest expense. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cash paid for interest, excluding net swap settlements for our floating-to-fixed interest rate swap, was 345.0 million and 321.5 million, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 2,034.4 million of principal floating rate debt. If interest rates increased or decreased by 100 basis points on our floating rate debt, annualized interest expense and net cash payments for interest would increase or decrease by approximately 20 million. 
 Loss on Extinguishment of Debt 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a loss of 2.4 million due to the amendment and restatement of the Credit Facility. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred a loss on the early extinguishment of debt related to the early repayment of a portion of our Term Loan Facility. We incurred non-cash charges related to the proportional share of unamortized deferred issuance costs of 0.2 million. 
 Settlements and Withdrawals on Pension Plans 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a settlement of our defined benefit pension plan. The settlement included a combination of lump-sum payments to participants who elected to receive them and the transfer of benefit obligations to a third-party insurance company under a group annuity contract. As a result of the settlements, we recognized a non-cash gain of 7.4 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to the accelerated recognition of the proportional share of unamortized net actuarial gains in accumulated other comprehensive loss. We expect to settle all remaining obligations by the end of 2024. 
 Income Taxes 
 Our effective tax rate, exclusive of non-controlling interests, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 12.5 and 19.4 , respectively. Our effective tax rate, exclusive of non-controlling interests, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 20.8 and 24.4 , respectively. Our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflects a benefit of 81.0 million and 122.0 million, respectively, due to our investments in renewable energy assets qualifying for tax credits under Section 48 of the Internal Revenue Code, 6.2 million due to the realization of additional federal and state benefits, as well as adjustments to deferred taxes due to the completion of our 2023 tax returns. 
 
 Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 reflected benefits of 20.6 million from tax settlements, 7.9 million from investments in solar energy assets qualifying for federal tax credits under Section 48 of the Internal Revenue Code, 6.8 million due to the realization of additional federal and state benefits, as well as adjustments to deferred taxes due to the completion of our 2022 tax returns. 
 Net cash paid for income taxes was 183.4 million and 137.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 Reportable Segments 
 Our senior management evaluates, oversees and manages the financial performance of our operations through three field groups, referred to as Group 1, Group 2 and Group 3. Group 1 is our recycling and waste business operating primarily in geographic areas located in the western United States. Group 2 is our recycling and waste business operating primarily in geographic areas located in the southeastern and mid-western United States, the eastern seaboard of the United States, and Canada. Group 3 is our environmental solutions business operating primarily in geographic areas located across the United States and Canada. These groups are presented below as our reportable segments, which each provide integrated environmental services, including but not limited to collection, transfer, recycling and disposal. 
 Corporate entities and other include legal, tax, treasury, information technology, risk management, human resources, closed landfills, and other administrative functions. National Accounts revenue included in Corporate entities and other represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide and regional contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated material handling is subcontracted to local operators. Consequently, substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs, which are recorded in cost of operations. Revenue and overhead costs of Corporate entities and other are either specifically assigned or allocated on a rational and consistent basis among our reportable segments to calculate Adjusted EBITDA. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is the single financial measure our chief operating decision maker (CODM) uses to evaluate operating segment profitability and determine resource allocations. Summarized financial information regarding our reportable segments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in millions of dollars) follows. For totals as well as further detail regarding our reportable segments and the adjustments used to calculate Adjusted EBITDA for each segment, see Note 12, Segment Reporting , of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 (1) The Recycling Waste Subtotal represents the combined results of our Group 1 and Group 2 reportable segments. 
 Significant changes in the revenue and Adjusted EBITDA of our reportable segments comparing the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are discussed below. 
 Group 1 
 Adjusted EBITDA in Group 1 increased from 553.9 million and 1,570.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, to 615.8 million and 1,765.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 The most significant items impacting adjusted EBITDA in Group 1 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 include: 
 Net revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 6.2 due to an increase in average yield in all lines of business and volume increases in our small container line of business. These increases were partially offset by decreased volume in our large container collection, transfer and landfill lines of business. 
 Net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 8.4 due to an increase in average yield in all lines of business and increased volumes in our small container collection line of business. These increases were partially offset by volume declines in our large-container collection, landfill and transfer lines of business. The decline in volume in our landfill line of business is primarily attributable to decreased special waste volumes, partially offset by increased solid waste and construction and demolition volumes. 
 Cost of operations increased primarily due to an increase in labor costs and higher third-party maintenance costs due to inflationary pressures and the impact of acquisitions. The unfavorable impact was partially offset by a decrease in fuel costs due to a decrease in average fuel price per gallon. 
 Group 2 
 Adjusted EBITDA in Group 2 increased from 500.4 million and 1,464.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, to 569.2 million and 1,643.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.

Table of Contents 

 The most significant items impacting adjusted EBITDA in Group 2 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 include: 
 Net revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 4.4 and 5.1 , respectively, due to an increase in average yield in all lines of business and increased volumes in our landfill line of business. The increase in volume in our landfill line of business was primarily due to increased solid and special waste volumes. These increases were partially offset by decreased construction and demolition landfill volumes as well as decreased volumes in our collection and transfer lines of business. 
 Cost of operations increased primarily due to an increase in labor costs and higher third-party maintenance costs due to inflationary pressures. The unfavorable impact was partially offset by a decrease in fuel costs due to a decrease in average fuel price per gallon. 
 Group 3 
 Adjusted EBITDA in Group 3 increased from 91.4 million and 266.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, to 118.3 million and 317.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 The most significant items impacting adjusted EBITDA in Group 3 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 include: 
 Net revenue for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased due to acquisition-related growth and favorable pricing. 
 Cost of operations increased primarily due to an increase in labor costs and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in subcontract volumes . 
 
 Landfill and Environmental Matters 
 Available Airspace 
 As of September 30, 2024 , we owned or operated 208 active landfills with total available disposal capacity estimated to be 5.1 billion in-place cubic yards. For these landfills, the following table reflects changes in capacity and remaining capacity, as measured in cubic yards of airspace: Balance as of December 31, 2023 
 New Expansions Undertaken Landfills Acquired, Net of Divestitures Permits Granted / New Sites, Net of Closures Airspace Consumed Changes in Engineering Estimates Balance as of September 30, 2024 
 Cubic yards (in millions): Permitted airspace 4,821.3 12.0 (64.8) 4,768.5 Probable expansion airspace 282.7 3.5 (4.4) 281.8 Total cubic yards (in millions) 5,104.0 3.5 7.6 (64.8) 5,050.3 Number of sites: Permitted airspace 207 1 208 Probable expansion airspace 14 1 (1) 14 
 Total available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated permitted airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace. Engineers develop these estimates at least annually using information provided by annual aerial surveys. Before airspace included in an expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace and, therefore, included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity, it must meet all of our expansion criteria. 
 As of September 30, 2024 , 14 of our landfills met all of our criteria for including their probable expansion airspace in their total available disposal capacity. At projected annual volumes, these 14 landfills have an estimated remaining average site life of 51 years, including probable expansion airspace. The average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is 56 years. We have other expansion opportunities that are not included in our total available airspace because they do not meet all of our criteria for treatment as probable expansion airspace. 
 Remediation and Other Charges for Landfill Matters 
 It is reasonably possible that we will need to adjust our accrued landfill and environmental liabilities to reflect the effects of new or additional information, to the extent that such information impacts the costs, timing or duration of the required actions. Future changes in our estimates of the costs, timing or duration of the required actions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

 Material Cash Requirements and Intended Uses of Cash 
 We expect existing cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities, cash flows from operations and financing activities to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Our known current- and long-term uses of cash include, among other possible demands: (1) capital expenditures and leases; (2) acquisitions; (3) dividend payments; (4) repayments to service debt and other long-term obligations; (5) payments for asset retirement obligations and environmental liabilities; and (6) share repurchases. 
 We may choose to voluntarily retire certain portions of our outstanding debt before their maturity dates using cash from operations or additional borrowings. We may also explore opportunities in the capital markets to fund redemptions should market conditions be favorable. Early extinguishment of debt will result in an impairment charge in the period in which the debt is repaid. The loss on early extinguishment of debt relates to premiums paid to effectuate the repurchase and the relative portion of unamortized note discounts and debt issue costs. 
 Acquisitions 
 Our acquisition growth strategy focuses primarily on acquiring privately held recycling and waste companies and environmental solutions businesses that complement our existing business platform. We continue to invest in value-enhancing acquisitions in existing markets. 
 In 2024, we expect to invest at least 250 million in acquisitions, including an investment in a post-collection business. 
 Summary of Cash Flow Activity 
 The major components of changes in cash flows are discussed in the following paragraphs. The following table summarizes our cash flow from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: Nine Months Ended September 30, 
 2024 2023 Cash Provided by Operating Activities 2,914.0 2,719.3 Cash Used in Investing Activities (1,748.5) (2,100.8) Cash Used in Financing Activities (1,188.1) (579.2) 
 Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities 
 We use cash flows from operations to fund capital expenditures and leases, acquisitions, dividend payments, share repurchases, interest payments and repayments of debt and other long-term obligations, and payments for asset retirement obligations and environmental liabilities. 
 The most significant items affecting the comparison of our cash flows provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are summarized below. 
 Changes in assets and liabilities, net of effects from business acquisitions and divestitures, decreased our cash flow from operations by 244.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to an increase of 68.9 million during the same period in 2023, primarily as a result of the following: 
 Our accounts receivable, exclusive of the change in allowance for doubtful accounts and customer credits, increased 99.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to the timing of billings net of collections, compared to a 161.0 million increase in the same period in 2023. As of September 30, 2024, our days sales outstanding were 41.2, or 30.4 days net of deferred revenue, compared to 43.5, or 32.0 days net of deferred revenue, as of September 30, 2023. 
 Our prepaid expenses and other assets increased 59.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a 121.4 million decrease in the same period in 2023. The increase in prepaid expenses and other assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily driven by an increase in capitalized implementation costs for our cloud-based hosting arrangements and higher insurance premium costs, partially offset by a decrease of tax receivables due to the timing of our estimated tax payments. 
 Our accounts payable decreased 26.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a 93.5 million increase in the same period in 2023, due to the timing of payments. 
 Cash paid for capping, closure and post-closure obligations was 35.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 40.5 million in the same period in 2023. 
 Cash paid for remediation obligations was 13.5 million higher during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023.

 In addition, cash paid for interest, excluding net swap settlements for our floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps, was 345.0 million and 321.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash paid for incomes taxes was 183.4 million and 137.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities 
 The most significant items affecting the comparison of our cash flows used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are summarized below: 
 Capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 1,357.4 million, compared with 1,083.2 million for the same period in 2023. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we paid 400.4 million and 1,051.1 million, respectively, for acquisitions and investments. 
 We intend to finance future capital expenditures and acquisitions through cash on hand, restricted cash held for capital expenditures, cash flows from operations, our revolving credit facilities, and tax-exempt bonds and other financings. We expect to primarily use cash and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities to pay for future acquisitions. 
 Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities 
 The most significant items affecting the comparison of our cash flows (used in) provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are summarized below: 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we issued 900.0 million of senior notes for cash proceeds, net of discounts and fees, of 888.8 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we issued 1,200.0 million of senior notes for cash proceeds, net of discounts and fees, of 1,183.6 million. Net payments from notes payable and long-term debt were 1,219.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net payments of 1,084.5 million during the same period in 2023. For a more detailed discussion, see the Financial Condition section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 1.7 million shares of our stock for 320.7 million, compared to repurchases of 1.3 million shares for 190.4 million during the same period in 2023. 
 Dividends paid were 504.8 million and 469.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Financial Condition 
 Debt Obligations 
 As of September 30, 2024 , we had 513.0 million of principal debt maturing within the next 12 months, which includes certain finance lease obligations. All of our tax-exempt financings are remarketed either quarterly or semiannually by remarketing agents to effectively maintain a variable yield, with the exception of three tax-exempt financings each with an initial remarketing period of 10 years. The holders of the bonds can put them back to the remarketing agents at the end of each interest period. If the remarketing agents are unable to remarket our bonds, the remarketing agents can put the bonds to us. In the event of a failed remarketing, as of September 30, 2024 , we had availability under our Credit Facility to fund these bonds until they are remarketed successfully. In the event of a failed re-borrowing under our commercial paper program, as of September 30, 2024 , we had availability under our Credit Facility to fund the commercial paper program until it is re-borrowed successfully. Accordingly, we have classified these tax-exempt financings and commercial paper program borrowings as long-term in our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 . 
 For further discussion of the components of our overall debt, see Note 7, Debt, of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Credit Facilities 
 Uncommitted Credit Facility 
 In January 2022, we entered into a 200.0 million unsecured uncommitted revolving credit facility (the Uncommitted Credit Facility). The Uncommitted Credit Facility bears interest at an annual percentage rate to be agreed upon by both parties. Borrowings under the Uncommitted Credit Facility can be used for working capital, letters of credit, and other general corporate purposes. The agreement governing our Uncommitted Credit Facility requires us to comply with certain covenants. The Uncommitted Credit Facility may be terminated by either party at any time. As of September 30, 2024, we had 92.6 million of borrowings outstanding under our Uncommitted Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2023, we had no borrowings outstanding under our Uncommitted Credit Facility.

 The Credit Facility 
 In July 2024, we and our subsidiary, USE Canada Holdings, Inc. (the Canadian Borrower) entered into the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Facility) which amends and restates the unsecured revolving credit facility we entered into in August 2021. The total outstanding principal amount that we may borrow under the Credit Facility may not exceed the current aggregate lenders' commitments of 3.5 billion, and borrowings under the Credit Facility mature in July 2029. As permitted by the Credit Facility, we have the right to request two one-year extensions of the maturity date, but none of the lenders are committed to participate in such extensions. The Credit Facility also includes a feature that allows us to increase availability, at our option, by an aggregate amount of up to 1.0 billion through increased commitments from existing lenders or the addition of new lenders. 
 All loans to the Canadian Borrower and all loans denominated in Canadian dollars cannot exceed 1.0 billion (the Canadian Sublimit). The Canadian Sublimit is part of, and not in addition to, the aggregate commitments under the Credit Facility. 
 Borrowings under the Credit Facility in United States dollars bear interest at a Base Rate, a daily floating SOFR or a term SOFR plus a current applicable margin of 0.920 based on our Debt Ratings (all as defined in the Credit Facility agreement). The Canadian dollar-denominated loans bear interest based on the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, C 241.0 million and C 201.5 million, respectively, were outstanding against the Canadian Sublimit. The weighted average interest rate for borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2024 was 5.525 . 
 The Credit Facility is subject to facility fees based on applicable rates defined in the Credit Facility agreement and the aggregate commitment, regardless of usage. The Credit Facility can be used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, letters of credit and other general corporate purposes. The Credit Facility agreement requires us to comply with financial and other covenants. We may pay dividends and repurchase common stock if we are in compliance with these covenants. 
 We had 178.3 million and 297.1 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We had 315.2 million and 336.5 million of letters of credit outstanding under our Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We also had 594.8 million and 495.3 million of principal borrowings outstanding (net of related discount on issuance) under our commercial paper program as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As a result, availability under our Credit Facility was 2,411.5 million and 2,371.2 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Financial and Other Covenants 
 The Credit Facility requires us to comply with financial and other covenants. To the extent we are not in compliance with these covenants, we cannot pay dividends or repurchase common stock. Compliance with covenants also is a condition for any incremental borrowings under the Credit Facility, and failure to meet these covenants would enable the lenders to require repayment of any outstanding loans (which would adversely affect our liquidity). The Credit Facility provides that our total debt to EBITDA ratio may not exceed 3.75 to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. In the case of an "elevated ratio period", which may be elected by us if one or more acquisitions during a fiscal quarter involve aggregate consideration in excess of 200.0 million (the Trigger Quarter), the total debt to EBITDA ratio may not exceed 4.25 to 1.00 during the Trigger Quarter and for the three fiscal quarters thereafter. The Credit Facility also provides that there may not be more than two elevated ratio periods during the term of the Credit Facility agreement. As of September 30, 2024, our total debt to EBITDA ratio was approximately 2.6 to 1.0 compared to the 3.75 to 1.0 maximum allowed by the covenants. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants unde r our Credit Facility, and we exp ect to be in compliance throughout the remainder of 2024. 
 EBITDA, which is a non-U.S. GAAP measure, is calculated as defined in our Credit Facility agreement. In this context, EBITDA is used solely to provide information regarding the extent to which we are in compliance with debt covenants and is not comparable to EBITDA used by other companies or used by us for other purposes. 
 Failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under the Credit Facility, as well as the occurrence of certain material adverse events, would constitute defaults and would allow the lenders under the Credit Facility to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the Credit Facility. This could have an adverse effect on the availability of financial assurances. In addition, maturity acceleration on the Credit Facility constitutes an event of default under other debt and derivative instruments. If such acceleration were to occur, we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness. We would likely have to seek an amendment under the Credit Facility for relief from the financial covenant or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity, or asset sales, if necessary. We may be unable to amend the Credit Facility or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturity is accelerated. 
 Term Loan Facility 
 On April 29, 2022, we entered into a 1.0 billion term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility) which bore interest at a base rate or a forward-looking SOFR, plus an applicable margin based on our debt ratings. We had 500.0 million of borrowings 
 46 

Table of Contents 

 outstanding under the Term Loan Facility as of December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repaid the remaining balance of the Term Loan Facility. 
 Commercial Paper Program 
 We have entered into a commercial paper program for the issuance and sale of unsecured commercial paper in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed 1.5 billion outstanding at any one time. The weighted average interest rate for borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2024 was 4.910 with a weighted average maturity of 11 days. 
 We had 595.0 million and 496.0 million in aggregate principal amount of commercial paper issued and outstanding under the program as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In the event of a failed re-borrowing, we currently have availability under our Credit Facility to fund the commercial paper program until it is re-borrowed successfully. Accordingly, we have classified these borrowings as long-term in our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. 
 Senior Notes and Debentures 
 In March 2023, we issued 400.0 million of 4.875 senior notes due 2029 (the Existing 2029 Notes) and 800.0 million of 5.000 senior notes due 2034. We used the proceeds from the March 2023 notes issuance for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of a portion of amounts outstanding under the Uncommitted Credit Facility, the Commercial Paper Program, the Credit Facility, and the Term Loan Facility. As a result of the Term Loan Facility repayment, we incurred a non-cash loss on the early extinguishment of debt related to the ratable portion of unamortized deferred issuance costs of 0.2 million. 
 In December 2023, we issued an additional 350.0 million of 4.875 senior notes due 2029 (the New 2029 Notes, and together with the Existing 2029 Notes, the 2029 Notes). After giving effect to the issuance of the New 2029 Notes, 750.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Notes is outstanding. The New 2029 Notes are fungible with the Existing 2029 Notes, and taken together, the 2029 Notes are treated as a single series. 
 In December 2023, we also issued 650.0 million of 5.000 senior notes due 2033. The proceeds of the December 2023 notes issuance were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of a portion of amounts outstanding under the Uncommitted Credit Facility, the Commercial Paper Program, the Credit Facility, and the Term Loan Facility. 
 In June 2024, we issued 400.0 million of 5.000 senior notes due 2029 and 500.0 million of 5.200 senior notes due 2034. We used the proceeds from the June 2024 notes issuance for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of a portion of amounts outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program and the Credit Facility; and repayment of the remaining amount outstanding under the Term Loan Facility and the Uncommitted Credit Facility. 
 Our senior notes and debentures are general unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured obligations. 
 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Relationships 
 Our ability to obtain financing through the capital markets is a key component of our financial strategy. Historically, we have managed risk associated with executing this strategy, particularly as it relates to fluctuations in interest rates, by using a combination of fixed and floating rate debt. From time to time, we also have entered into interest rate swap and lock agreements to manage risk associated with interest rates, either to effectively convert specific fixed rate debt to a floating rate (fair value hedges), or to lock interest rates in anticipation of future debt issuances (cash flow hedges). 
 Additionally, we amended certain interest rate lock agreements, extending the mandatory maturity date and dedesignated them as cash flow hedges (the Extended Interest Rate Locks). In addition, we entered into offsetting interest rate contracts to offset future exposures to fair value fluctuations of the Extended Interest Rate Locks. 
 For a description of our derivative contracts and hedge accounting, see Note 7, Debt , to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Tax-Exempt Financings 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 1,408.7 million and 1,280.6 million, respectively, of certain variable rate tax-exempt financings outstanding, with maturities ranging from 2026 to 2054 and from 2024 to 2053, respectively. 
 Finance Leases 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had finance lease liabilities of 291.1 million and 251.3 million, respectively, with maturities ranging from 2024 to 2063 for both periods. 
 Credit Ratings 
 Our continued access to the debt capital markets and to new financing facilities, as well as our borrowing costs, depend on multiple factors, including market conditions, our operating performance and maintaining strong credit ratings. As of 
 47 

Table of Contents 

 September 30, 2024, our credit ratings were BBB+, Baa1 and A- by Standard Poor s Ratings Services, Moody s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings, Inc, respectively. If our credit ratings were downgraded, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, our ability to access the debt markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, our cost of funds and other terms for new debt issuances, could be adversely impacted. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We have no off-balance sheet debt or similar obligations, other than short-term operating leases and financial assurances, which are not classified as debt. We have no transactions or obligations with related parties that are not disclosed, consolidated into or reflected in our reported financial position or results of operations. We have not guaranteed any third-party debt. 
 Seasonality and Severe Weather 
 Our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement or severe weather, which could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts (without corresponding compensation), delay the collection and disposal of waste, reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites, or delay the construction or expansion of our landfills and other facilities. Our operations also can be favorably affected by severe weather, which could increase the volume of waste in situations where we are able to charge for our additional services. 
 Contingencies 
 For a description of our commitments and contingencies, see Note 6, Landfill and Environmental Costs , Note 8, Income Taxes, and Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies , to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates 
 We identified and discussed our critical accounting judgments and estimates in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Although we believe our estimates and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information available at the time the judgment or estimate is made. Actual results may differ significantly from estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 New Accounting Pronouncements 
 For a description of new accounting standards that may affect us, see Note 1, Basis of Presentation , to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
 Fuel Price Risk 
 Fuel costs represent a significant operating expense. When economically practical, we may enter into new fuel hedges, renew contracts, or engage in other strategies to mitigate market risk. As of September 30, 2024, we had no fuel hedges in place. While we charge fuel recovery fees to a majority of our customers, we are unable to charge such fees to all customers. 
 At current consumption levels, we believe a twenty-cent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel would change our fuel costs by approximately 27 million per year. Offsetting these changes in fuel expense would result in changes in our fuel recovery fee charged to our customers. At current participation rates, we believe a twenty-cent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel would change our fuel recovery fee by approximately 36 million per year. 
 Our operations also require the use of certain petrochemical-based products (such as liners at our landfills) the cost of which may vary with the price of petrochemicals. An increase in the price of petrochemicals could increase the cost of those products, which would increase our operating and capital costs. We also are susceptible to increases in fuel recovery fees from our vendors. 
 Our fuel costs were 360.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, or 3.0 of revenue, compared to 406.3 million, or 3.6 of revenue, during the comparable period in 2023. 
 Commodities Price Risk 
 We market recovered materials such as old corrugated containers and old newsprint from our recycling centers. Changes in market supply and demand for recycled commodities causes volatility in commodity prices. In prior periods, we have entered into derivative instruments such as swaps and costless collars designated as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to changes in prices of these commodities. As of September 30, 2024, we had no recycling commodity hedges in place. 
 At current volumes and mix of materials, we believe a 10 change in the price of recycled commodities would change both annual revenue and operating income by approximately 10 million. 
 48 

Table of Contents 

 Revenue from recycling processing and commodity sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 310.6 million and 226.6 million, respectively. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are subject to interest rate risk on our variable rate long-term debt. Additionally, we enter into various interest rate swap agreements with the goal of reducing overall borrowing costs and increasing our floating interest rate exposure, as well as interest rate locks to manage exposure to fluctuations in anticipation of future debt issuances. Our interest rate swap and lock contracts have been authorized pursuant to our policies and procedures. We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 2,034.4 million of principal floating rate debt. If interest rates increased or decreased by 100 basis points on our floating rate debt, annualized interest expense and net cash payments for interest would increase or decrease by approximately 20 million. This analysis does not reflect the effect that interest rates would have on other items, such as new borrowings and the impact on the economy. See Note 7, Debt, of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information regarding how we manage interest rate risk. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e), and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Based on an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this Form 10-Q identified in connection with that evaluation, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 In November 2023, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock or other ownership interests of Advanced Chemical Transport LLC. In December 2023, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership and other equity interests of Central Texas Refuse, LLC and an affiliate thereof. As permitted by the SEC Staff interpretive guidance for newly acquired businesses, management's assessment of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024 did not include an assessment of internal control over financial reporting as it relates to these acquisitions. We will continue the process of implementing internal controls over financial reporting for these acquired businesses. These businesses contributed approximately 2 of revenue to our unaudited consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 
 General Legal Proceedings 
 We are subject to extensive and evolving laws and regulations and have implemented safeguards to respond to regulatory requirements. In the normal course of our business, we become involved in legal proceedings. Some may result in fines, penalties or judgments against us, or settlements, which may impact earnings and cash flows for a particular period. Although we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any legal matter with certainty, we do not believe the outcome of any of our pending legal proceedings will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 As used in the immediately following paragraph, the term legal proceedings refers to litigation and similar claims against us and our subsidiaries, excluding: (1) ordinary course accidents, general commercial liability and workers' compensation claims, which are covered by insurance programs, subject to customary deductibles, and which, together with self-insured employee health care costs, are discussed in Note 5, Other Liabilities, to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q; and (2) environmental remediation liabilities, which are discussed in Note 6, Landfill and Environmental Costs, to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 We accrue for legal proceedings when losses become probable and reasonably estimable. We recorded an aggregate accrual of approximately 13 million relating to our outstanding legal proceedings as of September 30, 2024. As of the end of each applicable reporting period, we review each of our legal proceedings and, where it is probable that a liability has been incurred, we accrue for all probable and reasonably estimable losses. Where we are able to reasonably estimate a range of losses we may incur with respect to such a matter, we record an accrual for the amount within the range that constitutes our best estimate. If we are able to reasonably estimate a range but no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other, we use the amount that is the low end of such range. If we had used the high ends of such ranges, our aggregate potential liability would be approximately 8 million higher than the amount recorded as of September 30, 2024. 
 Legal Proceedings over Certain Environmental Matters Involving Governmental Authorities with Possible Sanctions of 1,000,000 or More 
 Item 103 of the SEC's Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and the proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions unless we reasonably believe the monetary sanctions will not equal or exceed a threshold which we determine is reasonably designed to result in disclosure of any such proceeding that is material to our business or financial condition. We have determined such disclosure threshold to be 1,000,000. We have no matters to disclose in accordance with that requirement. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

While the Board of Directors has approved the program, the timing of any purchases, the prices and the number of shares of common stock to be purchased will be determined by our management, at its discretion, and will depend upon market conditions and other factors. The share repurchase program may be extended, suspended or discontinued at any time. As of September 30, 2024, there were 0.1 million repurchased shares pending settlement. 
 (b) The total number of shares purchased as part of the publicly announced program were all purchased pursuant to the October 2023 authorization.
