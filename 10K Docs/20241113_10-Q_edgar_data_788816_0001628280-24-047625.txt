(F) members. These contracts, which extend to December 31, 2085, are substantially identical and obligate our members jointly and severally to pay all expenses associated with owning and operating our power supply business. As a cooperative, we operate on a not-for-profit basis and, accordingly, seek only to generate revenues sufficient to recover our cost of service and to generate margins sufficient to establish reasonable reserves and meet certain financial coverage requirements. We also sell energy and capacity to non-members through industry standard contracts and negotiated agreements, respectively. We do not have multiple operating segments. 
 services, capacity and energy. Capacity and energy revenues are recognized by us upon transfer of control of promised services to our members and non-members in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those services. Capacity and energy are distinct and we account for them as separate performance obligations. The obligations to provide capacity and energy are satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of these services. Both performance obligations are provided directly by us and not through a third party. 
 Each of our members is obligated to pay us for capacity and energy we furnish under the wholesale power contract in accordance with rates we establish. We review our rates periodically but are required to do so at least once every year. Revenues from our members are derived through a cost-plus rate structure which is set forth as a formula in the rate schedule to the wholesale power contracts. The formulary rate provides for the pass-through of our (i) fixed costs (net of any income from other sources) plus a targeted margin as capacity revenues and (ii) variable costs as energy revenues from our members. Power purchase and sale agreements between us and non-members obligate each non-member to pay us for capacity, if any, and energy furnished in accordance with the prices mutually agreed upon. Margins produced from non-member sales are included in our rate schedule formula and reduce revenue requirements from our members. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we did not have any significant long-term contracts with non-members. 
 The consideration we receive for providing capacity services to our members is determined by our formulary rate on an annual basis. The components of the formulary rate associated with capacity costs include the annual budget of fixed costs, a targeted margin and income from other sources. Capacity revenues, therefore, vary to the extent these components vary. Fixed costs include items such as fixed operation and maintenance expenses, administrative and general expenses, depreciation and interest. Year to year, capacity revenue fluctuations are generally due to the recovery of fixed operation and maintenance expenses. Fixed costs also include certain costs, such as major maintenance costs, which will be recognized as expense in future periods. Recognition of revenues associated with these future expenses is deferred pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 980, Regulated Operations. The regulatory liabilities are amortized to revenue in accordance with the associated revenue deferral plan as the expenses are recognized. For information regarding regulatory accounting, see Note J. 
 Capacity revenues are recognized by us for standing ready to deliver electricity to our customers. Our capacity revenues are based on the associated costs we expect to recover in a given year and are generally recognized and billed to our members in equal monthly installments over the course of the year regardless of whether our generation and purchased power resources are dispatched to produce electricity. Non-member capacity revenues are billed and recognized in accordance with the terms of the associated contract. 
 We have a power bill prepayment program pursuant to which our members may prepay future capacity costs and receive a discount. As this program provides us with financing, we adjust our capacity revenues by the amount of the discount, which is based on our avoided cost of borrowing. For additional information regarding our member prepayment program, see Note K. 
 We satisfy our performance obligations to deliver energy as energy is delivered to the applicable meter points. We determine the standard selling price for energy we deliver to our members based upon the variable costs incurred to generate or purchase that energy. Fuel expense is the primary variable cost. Energy revenue recognized equals the actual variable expenses incurred in any given accounting period. Our member energy revenues fluctuate from period to period based on several factors, including fuel costs, weather and other seasonal factors, load requirements in our members' service territories, variable operating costs, the availability of electric generation resources, our decisions of whether to dispatch our owned or purchased resources or member-owned resources over which we have dispatch rights, and by members' decisions of whether to purchase a portion of their hourly energy requirements from our resources or from other suppliers. The standard selling price for our energy revenues from non-members is the price mutually agreed upon.

for each fiscal year. For 2024 and 2025, our board has approved targeted margins for interest ratios of and , respectively. Historically, our board of directors has approved adjustments to revenue requirements by year end such that revenue in excess of that required to meet the targeted margins for interest ratio is refunded to the members. Given that our capacity revenues are based upon budgeted expenditures and generally recognized and billed to our members in equal monthly installments over the course of the year, we may recognize capacity revenues that exceed our actual fixed costs and targeted margins in any given interim reporting period. At each interim reporting period we assess our projected revenue requirements through year end to determine whether a refund to our members of excess consideration is likely. If so, we reduce our capacity revenues and recognize a refund liability to our members. Refund liabilities, if any, are included in accounts payable on our unaudited consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we recognized refund liabilities totaling and , respectively. As of December 31, 2023, we recognized refund liabilities totaling . Based on our current agreements with non-members, we do not refund any consideration received from non-members. 
 Energy revenues Total 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a reduction of in fuel expense and a corresponding decrease in member energy revenues for the settlement of claims related to spent nuclear fuel storage costs. The combined settlements were credited to fuel expense, electric plant in service and production expenses, the accounts to which the original costs were recorded. For additional information regarding the claims for spent nuclear fuel storage costs, see Note P. 
 Receivables from contracts with our members at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were and , respectively. 
 Capacity revenues Total 
 Energy revenues from non-members for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were primarily from the sale of the BC Smith Energy Facility's deferring members' output into the wholesale market. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we also recognized capacity revenues from non-members related to a tolling agreement associated with the units we acquired at the Washington Power Plant in 2022. No capacity revenues were recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to the expiration of the tolling agreement in May 2024. 
 The remainder of our receivables is primarily related to transactions with Georgia Power, affiliated companies and investment income. Our receivables from non-members at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were and , respectively. Of our non-members receivables, receivables from Georgia Power at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were and , respectively. Our Georgia Power receivables at September 30, 2024 included related to spent nuclear fuel storage costs litigation. For additional information on spent nuclear fuel storage costs, see Note P.

. 
 In 2018, we began an additional rate management program that allowed us to recover future expense on a current basis from our members. In general, the program allowed for additional collections over a period with those amounts then applied to billings over the subsequent period. The program is designed primarily as a mechanism to assist our members in managing the rate impacts associated with the commercial operation of the new Vogtle units. In December 2022, collections from our members ended for this rate management program. Under this program, billing credits to participating members during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were and , respectively. Funds collected through this program are invested and held until applied to members' bills. Investments that mature and are expected to be applied to members' bills within the next twelve months are included in the Short-term investments line item within our unaudited consolidated balance sheets. In conjunction with this program, we applied regulated operations accounting to defer these revenues and related investment income on the funds collected. Amounts deferred under the program are amortized to income when applied to members' bills. The cumulative amount billed since inception of the program totaled . As of September 30, 2024, was our remaining liability to be credited to our members' bills. For additional information regarding our revenue deferral plan, see Note J. 
 
 (G) undivided interest in Scherer Unit No. 2 and railcar leases for the transportation of coal. We also have various other leases of minimal value. 
 Scherer Unit No. 2 leases as finance leases and our railcar leases as operating leases. We have made an accounting policy election not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities that arise from short-term leases, leases having an initial term of 12 months or less, for any class of underlying asset. We recognize lease expense for short-term leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease expense recognized for our short-term leases during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was insignificant. 
 Finance Leases 
 of our Scherer Unit No. 2 finance leases have lease terms through December 31, 2027, and lease extends through June 30, 2031. At the end of the leases, we can elect at our sole discretion to: 
 Renew the leases for a period of not less than and not more than at fair market value, 
 Purchase the undivided interest at fair market value, or 
 Redeliver the undivided interest to the lessors. 
 For rate-making purposes, we include the actual lease payments for our finance leases in our cost of service. The difference between lease payments and the aggregate of the amortization on the right-of-use asset and the interest on the finance lease obligation is recognized as a regulatory asset. Finance lease amortization is recorded in depreciation and amortization expense. 
 Operating Leases 
 Our railcar operating leases have terms that extend through March 31, 2029. At the end of the railcar operating leases, we can renew at terms mutually agreeable by us and the lessors, purchase the assets or return the assets to the lessors. We have additional operating leases including for office equipment that has a term extending through October 31, 2028 and for real property at one of our electric generating facilities that has a term extending through February 2042 with renewal option for a year term. 
 The exercise of renewal options for our finance and operating leases is at our sole discretion.

additional complaints, on October 8, 2021, on February 7, 2022, and on January 9, 2023, were filed in the Superior Court of Monroe County, Georgia against Georgia Power alleging that releases from Plant Scherer have impacted groundwater and air, resulting in alleged personal injuries and property damage. The plaintiffs sought an unspecified amount of monetary damages including punitive damages. After Georgia Power removed each of these cases to the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Georgia, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their complaints without prejudice in November 2022 and February 2023. On May 12, 2023, the plaintiffs refiled their complaints in the Superior Court of Monroe County. Also on May 12, 2023, a new complaint was filed in the Superior Court of Monroe County, Georgia against Georgia Power alleging that the construction and operation of Plant Scherer have impacted groundwater and air, resulting in alleged personal injuries. The plaintiff seeks an unspecified amount of monetary damages, including punitive damages. On May 18, 2023, Georgia Power removed all of these cases to the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Georgia. The plaintiffs are requesting the court remand the cases back to the Superior Court of Monroe County.

 million in asset retirement obligations and a corresponding decrease in asset retirement costs (electric plant in service). The decrease was primarily due to extending the assumed decommissioning dates of the reactors and an increase in credit-adjusted risk-free rates, partially offset by an increase in base year decommissioning costs. While evaluating the probability of the assumed dates of decommissioning, factors considered included, but were not limited to, examination of the nuclear unit's remaining operating and economic life, re-licensing expectations, and industry trends. Ultimately, the revised cost site studies reflected later assumed dates of decommissioning than the prior studies. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, change in cash flow estimates related to existing coal ash related asset retirement obligations was recorded. We expect to receive updated estimates from Georgia Power regarding closure costs and the timing of expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2024.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 General 
 We are a Georgia electric membership corporation (an EMC) incorporated in 1974 and headquartered in metropolitan Atlanta. We are owned by our 38 retail electric distribution cooperative members. Our members are consumer-owned distribution cooperatives providing retail electric service in Georgia on a not-for-profit basis. Our principal business is providing wholesale electric power to our members, which we provide primarily from our generation assets and, to a lesser extent, from power purchased from other suppliers. As with cooperatives generally, we operate on a not-for-profit basis. 
 We have a substantially similar wholesale power contract with each member that extends to December 31, 2085, and each contract will continue thereafter until terminated by three years' written notice by us or the respective member. For additional information regarding our wholesale power contracts with our members, see Item 1 BUSINESS OGLETHORPE POWER CORPORATION Wholesale Power Contracts in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 In September 2024, Hurricane Helene caused extensive damage in the Southeastern United States, including large areas of Georgia. While the hurricane only resulted in minor impacts on our generation resources during the storm, it caused significant damage in several of our members service territories and to the electrical transmission and distribution systems across Georgia, including the distribution systems of a few of our members. We are working with a couple of our smaller members to allow a relatively short grace period for their October 2024 bills totaling less than 4.5 million combined. We do not expect the hurricane to affect our financial condition or results of operations. 
 Results of Operations 
 For the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Net Margin 
 Our net margins for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 were 10.6 million and 76.9 million, compared to 27.1 million and 70.0 million for the same periods of 2023, respectively. Through September 30, 2024, we collected approximately 111 of our targeted net margin of 69.4 million for the year ending December 31, 2024. These collections are typical as our capacity revenues are generally recorded evenly throughout the year. We anticipate our board of directors will approve a budget adjustment by year end so that margins will achieve, but not exceed, the 2024 targeted margins for interest ratio of 1.14. As a result, we assessed our projected margin and annual revenue requirement to meet the targeted margins for interest ratio to determine if a refund liability should be recognized. As a result of this assessment, we recognized cumulative refund liabilities of 41.8 million and 10.3 million as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. For 2025, our board has approved a targeted margins for interest ratio of 1.10. For additional information regarding our net margin requirements and policy, see "Item 7 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Summary of Cooperative Operations Margins " in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Operating Revenues 
 Our operating revenues fluctuate from period to period based on several factors, including fuel costs, weather and other seasonal factors, load requirements in our members' service territories, operating costs, availability of electric generation resources, our decisions of whether to dispatch our owned, purchased or member-owned resources over which we have dispatch rights and our members' decisions of whether to purchase a portion of their hourly energy requirements from our resources or from other suppliers, and sales to non-members. 
 Sales to Members. We generate revenues principally from the sale of electric capacity and energy to our members. Capacity revenues are the revenues we receive for electric service whether or not our generation and purchased power resources are dispatched to produce electricity. These revenues are designed to recover the fixed costs associated with our business, including fixed production expenses, depreciation and amortization expenses and interest charges, plus a targeted margin. Energy revenues are the sales of electricity generated or purchased for our members. Energy revenues recover the variable costs of our business, including fuel, purchased energy and variable operation and maintenance expense.

The components of member revenues for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) (dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Capacity revenues 362,852 287,067 26.4 1,120,280 763,294 46.8 Energy revenues 152,645 184,421 (17.2) 492,854 461,343 6.8 Total 515,497 471,488 9.3 1,613,134 1,224,637 31.7 MWh Sales to members (1)

 (1) Excludes test energy megawatt-hours from Plant Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4 supplied to members. Any revenues and costs associated with test energy were capitalized. 
 
 Energy revenues from members decreased for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to recording the litigation settlement related to spent nuclear fuel storage costs in September 2024. Upon recognition of the settlement, we recorded a 37.3 million reduction in fuel expense and a corresponding decrease in member energy revenues. This decrease in member energy revenues was partially offset by an increase in megawatt-hours sold to members during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024. For additional information regarding spent nuclear fuel storage costs litigation, see Notes F and P of Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. Energy revenues from members increased for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to the increase in megawatt-hours sold to members and recovery of higher fuel costs. For a discussion of fuel costs, which are the primary costs recovered by energy revenues, see " Operating Expenses ." Capacity revenues from members increased for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to the recovery of increased fixed operating expenses, net interest expense and depreciation expense as a result of Plant Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4 being placed in service on July 31, 2023 and April 29, 2024, respectively. 
 
 Sales to non-members. Sales to non-members during the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) (dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Energy revenues 25,173 20,705 21.6 26,368 42,011 (37.2) Capacity revenues 8,583 (100.0) 1,572 12,970 (87.9) Total 25,173 29,288 (14.1) 27,940 54,981 (49.2) MWh Sales to non-members 707,330 591,926 19.5 760,831 1,317,214 (42.2) Cents/kWh 3.56 4.95 (28.1) 3.67 4.17 (12.0) 
 Energy revenues from non-members were primarily from the sale of the BC Smith Energy Facility's deferring members' output into the wholesale market. Energy revenues from non-members increased for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to an increase in megawatt-hours sold to non-members. Energy revenues from non-members decreased for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to a decrease in megawatt-hours sold to non-members as a result of a scheduled major maintenance outage at BC Smith that ended in the third quarter of 2024. Capacity revenues from non-members are related to a tolling agreement associated with the two units we acquired at the Washington Power Plant in December 2022. Capacity revenues from non-members decreased for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 due to the expiration of the tolling agreement on May 31, 2024.

 Total fuel costs decreased for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 as a result of the recognition of a 37.3 million reduction in fuel expense associated with the recovery of spent nuclear fuel storage costs and a decrease in the average cost of fuel. This decrease in fuel costs was offset by an increase in generation for members. Total fuel costs increased for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 as a result of an increase in generation for members offset by the decrease in energy costs related to the litigation settlement. The increase in generation was primarily due to Plant Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4 being placed in service on July 31, 2023 and April 29, 2024, respectively, and our members obtaining more of their energy requirements from us rather than their third party suppliers due to relative energy prices during the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in average fuel cost was primarily due to a reduction in fuel costs related to the spent nuclear fuel storage costs litigation and partially due to an increase in generation from our relatively more economical nuclear units. 
 Production Expenses 
 Production costs increased for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023 as a result 54.9 million higher fixed major maintenance outage costs associated with our combined cycle plants. Production costs also increased as a result of 48.6 million in production costs related to Plant Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4 for the nine-month 
 25 

period. Production costs for the new Vogtle units are net of 54.8 million in credits recognized during the period from the sale of nuclear production tax credits to Georgia Power. Production costs remained relatively unchanged for the comparable three-month periods. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expenses 
 Depreciation and amortization increased for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily as a result of 33.9 million and 84.0 million in depreciation expense for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, related to Plant Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4 being placed in service. 
 Interest Charges 
 Net interest charges increased for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023 as a result of lower capitalization of interest expense due to Plant Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4 being placed in service. 
 
 Financial Condition 
 Balance Sheet Analysis as of September 30, 2024 
 Assets 
 Electric plant in service increased by approximately 3.2 billion with a corresponding decrease of 3.0 billion in construction work in progress, primarily due to Plant Vogtle Unit No. 4 being placed in service. During the third quarter of 2024, we recorded a decrease of approximately 235.2 million in electric plant in service and a corresponding decrease in asset retirement obligations as we obtained revised decommissioning cost site studies for all our nuclear units. The decrease was primarily due to extending the assumed date of decommissioning for the reactors and an increase in credit-adjusted risk-free rates, partially offset by an increase in base year decommissioning costs. For additional information regarding such change in our asset retirement obligations, see Note O of Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash used for property additions for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 totaled 515.6 million. Of this amount, 109.7 million was associated with nuclear fuel purchases, 87.5 million was for construction expenditures for Vogtle Unit No. 4 and 75.2 million for the Walton acquisition. The remainder was for expenditures related to normal additions and replacements to our existing generation facilities. 
 
 The 85.7 million increase in the nuclear decommissioning trust fund was primarily due to reinvestment of fund earnings and an increase in the fair market value of investments due to continued appreciation in the stock market during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Long-term investments decreased 42.4 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to 155.6 million redeemed to fund expenses associated with our revenue deferral rate management plan, which was designed primarily to assist our members in managing the rate impacts associated with the new Vogtle units, and to fund major maintenance outages expenses. Largely offsetting these decreases was a 70.0 million increase in funds invested, including reinvestment of earnings, and a 25.4 million increase in fair market value. See Notes F and J of Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our member rate management programs and regulatory liabilities. 
 Receivables increased 66.7 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to a 76.6 million increase in receivables from Georgia Power related to a 78.3 million settlement receivable for spent nuclear fuel storage costs litigation judgements. See Notes F and P of Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the spent nuclear fuel storage costs litigation. 
 Prepayments and other current assets increased 24.0 million during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to a 12.3 million increase in the fair value of our natural gas hedges and an 8.1 million increase in prepayments for future major maintenance outage costs at our natural gas-fired facilities. 
 Equity and Liabilities 
 Long-term debt and long-term debt and finance leases due within one year increased 169.6 million primarily as a result of the issuance of 350.0 million of Series 2024A green first mortgage bonds and 124.9 million in advances under our Rural Utilities Service-guaranteed loans. Offsetting these increases was 304.6 million in debt service payments. See Note L of Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding long-term debt. 
 Short-term borrowings, which primarily provides interim financing for Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4 construction costs and the Walton acquisition, decreased 254.3 million during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. During this period, repayments totaled 493.0 million and total short-term borrowings were 238.7 million. 
 26 

Asset retirement obligations decreased 131.7 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to a decrease in cash flows estimates for nuclear asset retirement obligations of 235.2 million offset by recognized nuclear asset retirement obligations of 65.1 million due to Plant Vogtle Unit No. 4's nuclear reactor achievement of self-sustaining nuclear fission and 54.7 million in accretion expense. See Note O of Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our asset retirement obligations. 
 
 Regulatory liabilities decreased 17.2 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to a net 81.4 million decrease in the liability for our revenue deferral rate management plan, which is associated with the new Vogtle units, and a net 28.6 million decrease in the liability for collections of future major maintenance outage costs. Offsetting these decreases was a 69.7 million increase in deferred nuclear asset retirement obligations that was primarily driven by an increase in unrealized gains associated with our nuclear decommissioning investments, and a 12.2 million increase in the liability for collections of future debt service payments. See Notes F and Note J of Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our member rate management programs and regulatory liabilities. 
 Capital Requirements and Liquidity and Sources of Capital 
 Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4 
 We, Georgia Power, the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia (MEAG), and the City of Dalton, Georgia, acting by and through its Board of Water, Light and Sinking Fund Commissioners, doing business as Dalton Utilities (collectively, the Co-owners) are parties to an Ownership Participation Agreement that, along with other agreements, governs our participation in two additional nuclear units at Plant Vogtle, Units No. 3 and No. 4. The Co-owners appointed Georgia Power to act as agent under this agreement. Pursuant to this agreement, Georgia Power has designated Southern Nuclear Operating Company, Inc. as its agent for licensing, engineering, procurement and contract management. 
 Georgia Power placed Unit No. 3 in service on July 31, 2023 and placed Unit No. 4 in service on April 29, 2024. 
 Our ownership interest and proportionate share of the cost to construct Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4 is 30 , representing approximately 660 megawatts. As of September 30, 2024, our actual costs related to the new Vogtle units were approximately 8.3 billion, net of 1.1 billion we received from Toshiba Corporation under a Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately 427 million we received from Georgia Power. We estimate that our proportionate share of remaining additional capital costs to be incurred on the project through the end of 2024 to be 10- 15 million. 
 
 See Item 1 BUSINESS OUR POWER SUPPLY RESOURCES Future Power Resources Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4 in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 for additional information regarding our participation in Plant Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4. 
 
 Other Future Power Resources 
 As a result of projected load growth in Georgia, we and our members have approved the development and construction of two new natural gas-fired generation resources. One of the projects is an approximately 1,200 to 1,500 megawatt two-unit combined cycle generation facility to be located on land we own adjacent to the Smarr Energy Facility in Monroe County, Georgia. Our preliminary cost estimate for this facility is approximately 1.8 billion and the projected commercial operation date is 2029. The other project is an approximately 240 megawatt combustion turbine unit to be constructed at our Talbot Energy Facility in Talbot County, Georgia. Our preliminary cost estimate for this unit is approximately 360 million and the projected commercial operation date is 2029. In connection with these additional resources, we entered into agreements to provide firm capacity on new natural gas pipeline infrastructure to meet our anticipated fuel supply needs. We and our members may also continue to consider additional generation beyond these resources in the future. 
 
 Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships (GRIP) Program 
 
 On October 18, 2023, the Georgia Environmental Finance Authority, together with application partners Oglethorpe, Georgia Transmission Corporation and Georgia System Operations Corporation, announced that they had been selected for a 250 million grant under the Department of Energy s Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships (GRIP) Program. As part of the grant application, Oglethorpe applied for an aggregate of 75 megawatts of utility-scale battery storage which is estimated to utilize approximately 80 million of the total award. On October 1, 2024, Oglethorpe and its application partners were awarded the grant under the GRIP program. Receipt of any grant proceeds is subject to meeting program requirements. 
 
 Environmental Regulations 
 Federal and state laws and regulations regarding environmental matters affect operations at our facilities. For a discussion regarding potential effects on our business from environmental regulations, including potential capital requirements, see "Item 1 BUSINESS REGULATION Environmental," "Item 1A RISK FACTORS" and "Item 7 MANAGEMENT'S

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Financial Condition Capital Requirements Capital Expenditures " in our 2023 Form 10-K and "Risk Factors" in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2024. 
 On April 25, 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency issued a final rule to regulate carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil-fueled electric generating units under section 111 of the Clean Air Act (CAA). The primary focus of EPA s final rule is to (i) establish emission guidelines for states to set CO2 performance standards for existing coal-fired generating units and other fossil-fueled steam generating units that burn oil and natural gas under section 111 (d) of the Clean Air Act; and (ii) revise the new source performance standards for CO2 emissions from new and reconstructed stationary combustion turbines that burn natural gas and/or other fossil fuels under section 111 (b) of the CAA. We expect that the final rule is likely to have a significant impact on the power sector and we are reviewing the final rule to determine its impact on our operations. We believe that key assumptions in the rule, particularly regarding resource adequacy, availability and timing of required infrastructure and permitting, carbon capture and sequestration and the pace of technological advancements, continue to be unrealistic. A number of industry groups, electric generators and states have challenged the final rule in the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. On July 19, 2024, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit denied motions to stay the new rule pending judicial review. On October 16, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court denied emergency applications to stay implementation of the new rule. The ultimate impact of the rule will not be known until these legal challenges are complete. At this time, we cannot predict the outcome or potential cost of this rule, but such costs could be significant. 
 
 The incoming Trump administration is expected to direct EPA to reconsider and revise or rescind the EPA s final rule regulating CO2 emissions from power plants, among other regulatory actions affecting the power sector. Although we anticipate EPA s review of such regulations likely will result in less stringent requirements, we cannot predict the outcome of any final agency actions or court challenges to such final actions. 
 
 Liquidity 
 On May 23, 2024, we amended our syndicated line of credit among eleven lenders, including National Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance Corporation, as administrative agent to extend the maturity date for five years to May 23, 2029. In connection with this amendment, we increased the available amount under the credit agreement to 1.275 billion from 1.21 billion. On September 26, 2024, we amended our JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. line of credit facility to extend the maturity date to March 26, 2027. In connection with this amendment, we decreased the available amount under the credit agreement to 200 million from 350 million. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 1.6 billion of unrestricted available liquidity to meet our short-term cash needs and liquidity requirements. This amount included 243 million in cash and cash equivalents, and 1.4 billion available under our 1.7 billion of committed credit arrangements, the details of which are reflected in the table below: 
 Committed Credit Facilities Authorized Amount Available September 30, 2024 Expiration Date (dollars in millions) Unsecured Facilities: Syndicated Line among 11 banks led by CFC (1) 
 1,275 920 
 May 2029 CFC Line of Credit (2)

 200 197 
 March 2027 Secured Facilities: CFC Term Loan (2) 
 250 140 December 2028 
 (1) This facility is dedicated to support outstanding commercial paper and the portion of this facility that was unavailable represents outstanding commercial paper at September 30, 2024. 
 
 (2) Any amounts drawn under the 110 million unsecured line of credit with CFC will reduce the amount that can be drawn under the 250 million secured term loan. Therefore, we reflect 140 million as the amount available under the term loan even though there are no amounts outstanding under that facility. Any amounts borrowed under the 250 million term loan would be secured under our first mortgage indenture, with a maturity no later than December 31, 2043. 
 (3) At September 30, 2024, 2.5 million of this facility was used for letters of credit issued to provide performance assurance to third parties. 

We have the flexibility to use the 1.275 billion syndicated line of credit for several purposes, including borrowing for general corporate purposes, issuing letters of credit and backing up commercial paper. 
 
 28 

Under our commercial paper program, we are authorized to issue commercial paper in amounts that do not exceed the amount of our committed backup lines of credit, thereby providing 100 dedicated support for any commercial paper outstanding. Due to this requirement, any commercial paper we issue will reduce the availability under the 1.275 billion syndicated line of credit. At September 30, 2024, our outstanding commercial paper primarily was used to provide interim funding for: 
 
 payments related to the construction of Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4, 
 
 principal payments made under our Department of Energy-guaranteed loans, from February 2020 prior to the commercial operation date of Vogtle Unit 4, and 
 
 costs related to the Walton acquisition. 
 
 We plan to refinance our commercial paper with long-term debt. We intend to issue first mortgage bonds to provide for long-term financing of the construction costs for Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4 that have been financed on an interim basis with commercial paper, refinancing of the principal payments made under our Department of Energy-guaranteed loans prior to commercial operation of Vogtle Unit No. 4, and certain other costs not financed through the Rural Utilities Service. Rural Utilities Service financing is our preferred source of long-term financing for the Walton acquisition. 
 
 Our unsecured committed lines of credit permit the issuance of up to 810 million in letters of credit on our behalf, of which 807 million remained available at September 30, 2024. This letter of credit issuance capacity includes 500 million under our 1.275 billion syndicated line of credit, 200 million under our JPMorgan Chase line of credit, and 110 million under our CFC line of credit. 
 
 Three of our credit facilities contain a financial covenant that requires us to maintain minimum levels of patronage capital. At September 30, 2024 , t he highest required minimum level was 900 million and our actual patronage capital was 1.3 billion. Two of these agreements contain an additional covenant that limits our unsecured indebtedness, as defined in the credit agreements, to 4 billion. At September 30, 2024, we had 354 million of unsecured indebtedness outstanding. 
 
 Under our power bill prepayment program, members can prepay their power bills from us at a discount for an agreed number of months in advance, after which point the funds are credited against the participating members' monthly power bills. At September 30, 2024, we had six members participating in the program and a balance of 79.6 million remaining to be applied against future power bills. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 First Mortgage Indenture. At September 30, 2024, we had 12.3 billion of long-term debt outstanding under our first mortgage indenture secured equally and ratably by a lien on substantially all of our owned tangible and certain of our intangible property, including property we acquire in the future. See "Item 1 BUSINESS OGLETHORPE POWER CORPORATION First Mortgage Indenture" in our 2023 Form 10-K for further discussion of our first mortgage indenture. 
 
 Rural Utilities Service-Guaranteed Loans. A summary of our current Rural Utilities Service-Guaranteed Loans as of September 30, 2024 is provided in the table below: 
 
 Current Rural Utilities Service-Guaranteed Loans Amount Approved Amount Advanced September 30, 2024 Amount Remaining September 30, 2024 (dollars in millions) General and Environmental Improvements 630.3 455.3 
 175.0 General and Environmental Improvements 755.2 755.2 Washington Acquisition 87.9 87.9 Baconton Acquisition 17.5 17.5 Total 1,490.9 560.7 930.2 
 
 In August 2024, we fully advanced the Washington and Baconton acquisition loans. In October 2024, we began advancing on the 755.2 million approved general and environmental improvements loan and received 187.3 million in loan advances. 
 29 

When advanced, the debt will be secured ratably under our first mortgage indenture. As of September 30, 2024, we had 2.6 billion of debt outstanding under various Rural Utilities Service-guaranteed loans. 
 
 Department of Energy-Guaranteed Loans. We have loans from the Federal Financing Bank guaranteed by the Department of Energy that provided funding for over 4.6 billion of the cost to construct our interest in Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4. Under the Department of Energy-guaranteed loans we have 4.1 billion outstanding at September 30, 2024. All of the debt advanced under the loan guarantee agreement is secured ratably with all other debt under our first mortgage indenture. 
 
 In accordance with the promissory notes, we began principal repayments of our Department of Energy-guaranteed loans in February 2020. As of September 30, 2024 , we had repaid 550.1 million under these loans. We refinanced a portion of this amount by issuing green first mortgage bonds in June 2024. 
 
 For more information regarding the loan guarantee agreement, see Note L of Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. For more detailed information regarding our financing plans, see "Item 7 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Financial Condition Financing Activities " in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Bond Financings . On June 21, 2024, we issued 350 million of 5.80 green first mortgage bonds, Series 2024A, for the purpose of refinancing commercial paper we had issued to refinance Department of Energy guaranteed loans that matured prior to the commercial operation date of Vogtle Unit 4. In conjunction with the issuance of the bonds, we repaid 346 million of outstanding commercial paper. The bonds are due to mature in June 2054 and are secured under our first mortgage indenture. 
 
 We plan to issue approximately 350- 450 million of additional taxable first mortgage bonds in early 2025 to provide long-term financing or refinancing of expenditures related to Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4, including up to 350 million for the remaining long-term financing of the Vogtle units and up to 100 million, which, in addition to the 350 million that we issued in June 2024, will be used to refinance a portion of the 486 million of principal payments on our Department of Energy-guaranteed loans that were made prior to Vogtle Unit No. 4's in-service date.

In addition, the following terms have the following meanings in this Eighty-Ninth Supplemental Indenture unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. Business Day means each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday which is not a day on which banking institutions in New York or Georgia are generally authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close. Closing Date means June 21, 2024. Interest Payment Date means June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on December 1, 2024. Par Call Date has the meaning set forth in Section 2.2(a)(i) hereof.

Treasury Rate means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the yield determined by the Company in accordance with the following two paragraphs. The Treasury Rate shall be determined by the Company after 4:15 p.m., New York City time (or after such time as yields on U.S. government securities are posted daily by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System), on the third Business Day preceding the Redemption Date based upon the yield or yields for the most recent day that appear after such time on such day in the most recent statistical release published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System designated as Selected Interest Rates (Daily) - H.15 (or any successor designation or publication) H.15 under the caption U.S. government securities Treasury constant maturities Nominal (or any successor caption or heading) H.15 TCM ). In determining the Treasury Rate, the Company shall select, as applicable: (1) the yield for the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 exactly equal to the period from the Redemption Date to the Par Call Date (the Remaining Life or (2) if there is no such Treasury constant maturity on H.15 exactly equal to the Remaining Life, the two yields one yield corresponding to the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 immediately shorter than and one yield corresponding to the Treasury constant maturity on

For purposes of this paragraph, the applicable Treasury constant maturity or maturities on H.15 shall be deemed to have a maturity date equal to the relevant number of months or years, as applicable, of such Treasury constant maturity from the Redemption Date. If on the third Business Day preceding the Redemption Date H.15 TCM is no longer published, the Company shall calculate the Treasury Rate based on the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity at 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the second Business Day preceding such Redemption Date of the United States Treasury security maturing on, or with a maturity that is closest to, the Par Call Date, as applicable. If there is no United States Treasury security maturing on the Par Call Date but there are two or more United States Treasury securities with a maturity date equally distant from the Par Call Date, one with a maturity date preceding the Par Call Date and one with a maturity date following the Par Call Date, the Company shall select the United States Treasury security with a maturity date preceding the Par Call Date. If there are two or more United States Treasury securities maturing on the Par Call Date or two or more United States Treasury securities meeting the criteria of the preceding sentence, the Company shall select from among these two or more United States Treasury securities the United States Treasury security that is trading closest to par based upon the average of the bid and asked prices for such United States Treasury securities at 11:00 a.m., New York City time.

The Trustee may impose a charge sufficient to reimburse the Company or the Trustee for any tax, fee or other governmental charge required to be paid with respect to such exchange or any transfer of a Series 2024A Bond. The cost, if any, of preparing each new Series 2024A Bond issued upon such exchange or transfer, and any other expenses of the Company or the Trustee incurred in connection therewith, shall be paid by the person requesting such exchange or transfer. Interest on the Series 2024A Bonds shall be payable by check mailed to the registered owners thereof.

8 plus, in either case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but excluding, the Redemption Date. (ii) If the Redemption Date is on or after the Par Call Date, the Redemption Price for the Series 2024A Bonds will be 100 of the aggregate principal amount of the Series 2024A Bonds being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but excluding, the Redemption Date. (b) The Company s actions and determinations in determining the Redemption Price shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. (c) Notice of redemption shall be given by first class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date to the registered address of each Holder of Series 2024A Bonds being redeemed, except as otherwise required by the procedures of the Securities Depository.

(e) If, at the time the notice of optional redemption of the Series 2024A Bonds is given, the Company has not deposited sufficient funds with the Trustee to pay the full Redemption Price of the Series 2024A Bonds to be redeemed, the notice of optional redemption will so state and will further state that the Series 2024A Bonds will remain Outstanding as though no redemption notice had been given unless the Company provides, or causes to be provided, to the Trustee, by 2:00 p.m. New York City time on the Redemption Date, funds sufficient to pay the full Redemption Price of the Series 2024A Bonds to be redeemed. The failure of the Company to deposit sufficient funds with the Trustee to effect the redemption will not constitute a payment or other default by the Company under the Indenture and the Company will not be liable to any Holder of those Series 2024A Bonds as a result of the failed redemption. If the Company has deposited funds with the Trustee sufficient to pay the full Redemption Price of the Series 2024A Bonds to be redeemed at the time the notice of optional redemption is given, then the Company is obligated to redeem the Series 2024A Bonds as provided in that notice.

The Treasury Rate shall be determined by the Company after 4:15 p.m., New York City time (or after such time as yields on U.S. government securities are posted daily by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System), on the third Business Day preceding the Redemption Date based upon the yield or yields for the most recent day that appear after such time on such day in the most recent statistical release published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System designated as Selected Interest Rates (Daily) - H.15 (or any successor designation or publication) H.15 under the caption U.S. government securities Treasury constant maturities Nominal (or any successor caption or heading) H.15 TCM ). In determining the Treasury Rate, the Company shall select, as applicable: (1) the yield for the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 exactly equal to the period from the Redemption Date to the Par Call Date (the Remaining Life or (2) if there is no such Treasury constant maturity on H.15 exactly equal to the Remaining Life, the two yields one yield corresponding to the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 immediately shorter than and one yield corresponding to the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 immediately longer than the Remaining Life and shall interpolate to the Par Call Date on a straight-line basis (using the actual number of days) using such yields and rounding the result to three decimal places; or (3) if there is no such Treasury constant maturity on H.15 shorter than or longer than the Remaining Life, the yield for the single Treasury constant maturity on H.15 closest to the Remaining Life. For purposes of this paragraph, the applicable Treasury constant maturity or maturities on H.15 shall be deemed to have a maturity date equal to the relevant number of months or years, as applicable, of such Treasury constant maturity from the Redemption Date. If on the third Business Day preceding the Redemption Date H.15 TCM is no longer published, the Company shall calculate the Treasury Rate based on the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity at 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the second Business Day preceding such Redemption Date of the United States Treasury security maturing on, or with a maturity that is closest to, the Par Call Date, as applicable. If there is no United States Treasury security maturing on the Par Call Date but there are two or more United States Treasury securities with a maturity date equally distant from the Par Call Date, one with a maturity date preceding the Par Call Date and one with a maturity date following the Par Call Date, the Company shall select the United States Treasury security with a maturity date preceding the Par Call Date. If there are two or more United States Treasury securities maturing on the Par Call Date or two or more United States Treasury securities meeting the criteria of the preceding sentence, the Company shall select from among these two or more United States Treasury securities the United States Treasury security that is trading closest to par based upon the average of the bid and asked prices for such United States Treasury securities at 11:00 a.m., New York City time. In determining the Treasury Rate in accordance with the terms of this paragraph, the semi-annual yield to maturity of the applicable United States Treasury security shall be based upon the average of the bid and asked prices (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) at 11:00 a.m., New York City time, of such United States Treasury security, and rounded to three decimal places.
