Overview

Ollie s is a highly differentiated and fast-growing, extreme value retailer of brand name merchandise at drastically reduced prices. Known for our assortment of products offered as Good Stuff
 Cheap, we offer customers a broad selection of brand name products, including housewares, bed and bath, food, floor coverings, health and beauty aids, books and stationery, toys, and electronics. Our differentiated go-to market strategy is
 characterized by a unique, fun and engaging treasure hunt shopping experience, compelling customer value proposition and witty, humorous in-store signage and advertising campaigns . 

Our Growth Strategy

Since the founding of Ollie s in 1982, our principal growth strategy has been the opening of new stores. Historically, we have grown organically by backfilling existing markets and leveraging
 our brand awareness, marketing and infrastructure to expand into new markets in contiguous states. More recently, we have expanded through acquiring former 99 Cents Only and Big Lots stores through a bankruptcy auction process. As of November
 2, 2024, we operated a total of 546 stores located in 31 states.

Our stores are supported by four distribution centers, one each in York, PA, Commerce, GA, Lancaster, TX, and Princeton, IL. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company acquired land in
 Princeton, IL, for the construction of its fourth distribution center and broke ground on construction of our 615,000 square feet facility in April 2023. We completed the construction of the Princeton, IL distribution center in the second
 quarter of 2024 and began shipping product in July 2024. With the addition of our fourth distribution center, we believe our distribution capabilities will support up to 750 stores.

We have invested in our associates, infrastructure, distribution network and information systems to allow us to continue to rapidly grow our store footprint, including:

growing our merchant buying team to increase our access to brand name/closeout merchandise;

adding members to our senior management team;

expanding the capacity of our distribution centers to their current 3.0 million square feet with the completion of our fourth distribution center in Princeton, IL; and

investing in information technology, accounting, and warehouse management systems.

Our business model has produced consistent and predictable store growth over the past several years, during both strong and weaker economic cycles. We plan to continue to enhance our
 competitive positioning and drive growth in sales and profitability by executing on the following strategies:

growing our store base;

increasing our offerings of great bargains; and

leveraging and expanding Ollie s Army.

We have a proven portable, flexible, and highly profitable store model that has produced consistent financial results and returns. Our new store model targets a store size between 25,000 to
 35,000 square feet and an average initial cash investment of approximately 1.0 million, which includes store fixtures and equipment, store-level and distribution center inventory (net of payables), and pre-opening expenses. We target new
 store sales of approximately 4.0 million in their first full year of operations.

16 

Index 

While we are focused on driving comparable store sales and managing our expenses, our revenue and profitability growth will primarily come from opening new stores. The core elements of our
 business model are procuring great deals, offering extreme values to our customers and creating consistent, predictable store growth and margins. In addition, our new stores generally open strong, immediately contributing to the growth in net
 sales and profitability of our business. We plan to achieve continued net sales growth, including comparable stores sales, by adding stores to our store base and by continuing to provide quality merchandise at a value for our customers as we
 scale and gain more access to purchase directly from major manufacturers. We also plan to leverage and expand our Ollie s Army database marketing strategies. In addition, we plan to continue to manage our selling, general, and administrative
 expenses SG A by continuing to make process improvements and by maintaining our strong expense control discipline.

Our ability to grow and our results of operations may be impacted by additional factors and uncertainties, such as consumer spending habits, which are subject to macroeconomic conditions and
 changes in discretionary income. Our customers discretionary income is primarily impacted by gas prices, wages, rising interest rates, and consumer trends and preferences, which fluctuate depending on the environment. The potential
 consolidation of our competitors or other changes in our competitive landscape could also impact our results of operations or our ability to grow, even though we compete with a broad range of retailers.

Our key competitive advantage is our direct buying relationships with many major manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors, brokers, and retailers for our brand name closeout products and
 unbranded goods. We also augment our product mix with private label brands. As we continue to grow, we believe our increased scale will provide us with even greater access to brand name closeout products as major manufacturers seek a single
 buyer to acquire an entire deal.

How We Assess the Performance of Our Business and Key Line Items

We consider a variety of financial and operating measures in assessing the performance of our business. The key measures we use are number of new stores, net sales, comparable store sales,
 gross profit and gross margin, SG A, pre-opening expenses, operating income, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.

Number of New Stores

The number of new stores reflects the number of stores opened during a particular reporting period. Before we open new stores, we incur pre-opening expenses described below under Pre-Opening
 Expenses and we make an initial investment in inventory. We also make initial capital investments in fixtures and equipment, which we amortize over time.

We expect new store growth to be the primary driver of our sales growth. Our initial lease terms are approximately seven years with options to renew for three to five successive five-year
 periods. Our portable and predictable real estate model focuses on backfilling existing markets and entering new markets in contiguous states. Our new stores often open with higher sales levels as a
 result of greater advertising and promotional spend in connection with grand opening events, but decline shortly thereafter to our new store model levels.

Net Sales

Ollie s recognizes retail sales in its stores when merchandise is sold and the customer takes possession of the merchandise. Also included in net sales is revenue allocated to certain redeemed
 discounts earned via the Ollie s Army loyalty program and gift card breakage. Net sales are presented net of returns and sales tax. Net sales consist of sales from comparable stores and non-comparable stores, described below under Comparable
 Store Sales. Growth of our net sales is primarily driven by expansion of our store base in existing and new markets. As we continue to grow, we believe we will have greater access to brand name closeout merchandise and an increased deal
 selection, resulting in more potential offerings for our customers. Net sales are impacted by product mix, merchandise mix and availability, as well as promotional activities and the spending habits of our customers. Our broad selection of
 offerings across diverse product categories supports growth in net sales by attracting new customers, which results in higher spending levels and frequency of shopping visits from our customers, including Ollie s Army members.

17 

Index 

The spending habits of our customers are subject to macroeconomic conditions and changes in discretionary income. Our customers discretionary income is primarily impacted by gas prices,
 wages, inflation, and consumer trends and preferences, which fluctuate depending on the environment. However, because we offer a broad selection of merchandise at extreme values, we believe we are less impacted than other retailers by economic
 cycles that correspond with declines in general consumer spending habits. We believe we also benefit from periods of increased consumer spending.

Comparable Store Sales

Comparable store sales measure performance of a store during the current reporting period against the performance of the same store in the corresponding period of the previous year. Comparable
 store sales consist of net sales from our stores beginning on the first day of the sixteenth full fiscal month following the store s opening, which is when we believe comparability is achieved. Comparable store sales are impacted by the same
 factors that impact net sales.

We define comparable stores to be stores that:

have been remodeled while remaining open;

are closed for five or fewer days in any fiscal month;

are closed temporarily and relocated within their respective trade areas; and

have expanded, but are not significantly different in size, within their current locations.

Non-comparable store sales consist of new store sales and sales for stores not open for a full 15 months. Stores which are closed temporarily, but for more than five days in any fiscal month,
 are included in non-comparable store sales beginning in the fiscal month in which the temporary closure begins until the first full month of operation once the store re-opens, at which time they are included in comparable store sales.

Opening new stores is the primary component of our growth strategy and as we continue to execute on our growth strategy, we expect a significant portion of our sales growth will be attributable
 to non-comparable store sales. Accordingly, comparable store sales are only one measure we use to assess the success of our growth strategy.

Gross Profit and Gross Margin

Gross profit is equal to our net sales less our cost of sales. Cost of sales includes merchandise costs, inventory markdowns, shrinkage and transportation, distribution and warehousing costs,
 including depreciation. Gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of our net sales. Gross margin is a measure used by management to indicate whether we are selling merchandise at an appropriate gross profit.

In addition, our gross margin is impacted by product mix, as some products generally provide higher gross margins, by our merchandise mix and availability, and by our merchandise cost, which
 can vary.

Our gross profit is variable in nature and generally follows changes in net sales. We regularly analyze the components of gross profit, as well as gross margin. Specifically, our product
 margin and merchandise mix is reviewed by our merchant team and senior management, ensuring strict adherence to internal margin goals. Our disciplined buying approach has produced consistent gross margins and we believe helps to mitigate
 adverse impacts on gross profit and results of operation.

The components of our cost of sales may not be comparable to the components of cost of sales or similar measures of our competitors and other retailers. As a result, our gross profit and gross
 margin may not be comparable to similar data made available by our competitors and other retailers.

18 

Index 

Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses

SG A are comprised of payroll and benefits for store, field support, and support center associates. SG A also include marketing and advertising expense, occupancy costs for stores and
 the store support center, insurance, corporate infrastructure, and other general expenses. The components of our SG A remain relatively consistent per store and for each new store opening. The components of our SG A may not be
 comparable to the components of similar measures of other retailers. Consolidated SG A generally increase as we grow our store base and as our net sales increase. A significant portion of our expenses is primarily fixed in nature, and we
 expect to continue to maintain strict discipline while carefully monitoring SG A as a percentage of net sales. We expect that our SG A will continue to increase in future periods with future growth.

Depreciation and Amortization Expenses

Property and equipment are stated at original cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses are calculated over the estimated useful lives of the
 related assets, or in the case of leasehold improvements, the lesser of the useful lives or the remaining term of the lease. Expenditures for additions, renewals, and betterments are capitalized; expenditures for maintenance and repairs are
 charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are computed on the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes. Depreciation as it relates to our distribution centers is included within cost of sales on the condensed
 consolidated statements of income.

Pre-Opening Expenses

Pre-opening expenses consist of expenses of opening new stores and distribution centers, as well as store remodel and closing costs. For opening new stores, pre-opening expenses include grand
 opening advertising costs, payroll expenses, travel expenses, employee training costs, rent expenses, and store setup costs. Pre-opening expenses for new stores are expensed as they are incurred, which is typically within 30 to 45 days of
 opening a new store. For opening distribution centers, pre-opening expenses primarily include inventory transportation costs, employee travel expenses, and occupancy costs. Store remodel costs primarily consist of payroll expenses, travel
 expenses, and store setup costs expensed as they are incurred. Store closing costs primarily consist of insurance deductibles, rent, and store payroll.

Operating Income

Operating income is gross profit less SG A, depreciation and amortization, and pre-opening expenses. Operating income excludes net interest income or expense, and income tax expense or
 benefit. We use operating income as an indicator of the productivity of our business and our ability to manage expenses.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are key metrics used by management and our Board to assess our financial performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are also frequently used by analysts, investors and
 other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. We use Adjusted EBITDA to supplement U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP measures of performance to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, to
 make budgeting decisions, to evaluate our performance in connection with compensation decisions and to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. Management believes it is useful to investors and
 analysts to evaluate these non-GAAP measures on the same basis as management uses to evaluate the Company s operating results. We believe that excluding items from operating income, net income and net income per diluted share that may not be
 indicative of, or are unrelated to, our core operating results, and that may vary in frequency or magnitude, enhances the comparability of our results and provides a better baseline for analyzing trends in our business.

19 

Index 

We define EBITDA as net income before net interest income or expense, depreciation and amortization expenses and income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA as further adjusted for
 non-cash stock-based compensation expense. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and you
 should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. In the future we may incur expenses or charges such as those added back to calculate Adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of Adjusted
 EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by these items. For further discussion of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and for reconciliations of net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure,
 to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, see Results of Operations. 

Factors Affecting the Comparability of our Results of Operations

Our results over the past two years have been affected by the following factors, which must be understood in order to assess the comparability of our period-to-period financial
 performance and condition.

Historical Results

Historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future period.

Store Openings and Closings

We opened 24 new stores and closed three stores, two closures where the Company chose not to renew the leases and one temporary closure related to Hurricane Helene, in the third quarter of
 fiscal 2024 and opened 23 new stores in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. We opened 37 new stores and closed three stores in the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 and opened 38 new stores and closed one store in the thirty-nine weeks
 ended October 28, 2023.

Seasonality

Our business is seasonal in nature and demand is generally the highest in our fourth fiscal quarter due to the holiday sales season. To prepare for the holiday sales season, we must order and
 keep in stock more merchandise than we carry during other times of the year and generally engage in additional marketing efforts. We expect inventory levels, along with accounts payable and accrued expenses, to reach their highest levels in
 our third and fourth fiscal quarters in anticipation of increased net sales during the holiday sales season. As a result of this seasonality, and generally because of variation in consumer spending habits, we experience fluctuations in net
 sales and working capital requirements during the year. Because we offer a broad selection of merchandise at extreme values, we believe we are less impacted than other retailers by economic cycles which correspond with declines in general
 consumer spending habits, and we believe we still benefit from periods of increased consumer spending.

Third Quarter of Fiscal 2024 Compared to Third Quarter of Fiscal 2023

Net Sales

Net sales increased to 517.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 from 480.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, an increase of 37.4 million, or 7.8 . The increase was the
 result of a non-comparable store sales increase of 39.8 million, partially offset by a decrease in comparable store sales of 2.5 million. The increase in non-comparable store sales was driven by new store unit growth.

Comparable store sales decreased 0.5 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared with a 7.0 increase in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The decrease in comparable store sales was due to a
 slight decline in the number of transactions and average transaction size.

Gross Profit and Gross Margin

Gross profit increased to 214.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 from 194.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, an increase of 20.3 million, or 10.5 . Gross margin
 increased 100 basis points to 41.4 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 from 40.4 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase in gross margin in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was primarily due to favorable supply chain costs,
 partially offset by lower merchandise margin from the higher mix of consumer staples.

Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses

SG A increased to 154.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 from 141.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, an increase of 12.8 million, or 9.0 , primarily driven by
 higher selling expenses related to new store openings. As a percentage of net sales, SG A increased 40 basis points to 29.9 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 29.5 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, due to deleverage of
 fixed expenses associated with the decrease in comparable store sales.

Pre-Opening Expenses

Pre-opening expenses increased to 7.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 from 6.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 due to increased costs associated with the recently
 acquired former 99 Cents Only and Big Lots store locations, as well as timing of our planned new store openings. We opened 24 stores and closed three stores, two planned closures and one temporary closure related to Hurricane Helene in the
 third quarter of fiscal 2024 and opened 23 new stores in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. As a percentage of net sales, pre-opening expenses increased to 1.4 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 from 1.3 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023.

22 

Index 

Interest Income, Net

Interest income, net remained flat at 4.0 million in the third quarters of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively.

Income Tax Expense

Income tax expense increased to 12.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 11.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The effective tax rate for the third quarters of
 fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 was 26.1 , respectively. The effective income tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate, primarily due to the effect of state taxes and discrete tax benefits primarily related to stock-based compensation.
 Discrete tax benefits totaled 0.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to discrete tax benefits of 0.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023.

Net Income

As a result of the foregoing, net income increased to 35.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 from 31.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, an increase of 4.1 million or
 12.8 .

Adjusted EBITDA

Adjusted EBITDA increased to 59.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 from 51.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, an increase of 8.7 million, or 17.0 .

Year-to-Date Fiscal 2024 Compared to Year-to-Date Fiscal 2023

Net Sales

Net sales increased to 1.605 billion in the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 from 1.454 billion in the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023, an increase of 151.0 million, or
 10.4 . The increase was the result of a non-comparable store sales increase of 110.6 million and an increase in comparable store sales of 40.4 million. The increase in non-comparable store sales was driven by new store unit growth.

Comparable store sales increased 2.8 in the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 compared with a 6.5 increase in the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023. The increase in comparable
 store sales primarily consisted of an increase in basket and an increase in the number of transactions.

Gross Profit and Gross Margin

Gross profit increased to 642.8 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 from 569.4 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023. Gross margin increased 90 basis
 points to 40.1 in the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 from 39.2 in the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023. The increase in gross margin in the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 was primarily due to favorable supply
 chain costs as well as higher merchandise margins.

Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses

SG A increased to 442.6 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 from 406.6 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023, an increase of 36.0 million, or 8.9 ,
 primarily driven by higher selling expenses related to new store openings. As a percentage of net sales, SG A decreased 40 basis points to 27.6 in the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 from 28.0 in the thirty-nine weeks ended
 October 28, 2023. The decrease was primarily the result of leverage of fixed expenses on the increase in comparable store sales and disciplined expense control.

Pre-Opening Expenses

Pre-opening expenses increased to 14.5 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 from 12.4 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023 primarily due to the costs
 associated with the startup of the Company s fourth distribution center in Princeton, IL as well as the comparative number of new stores. During the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024, we opened 37 new stores and closed three stores, two
 planned closures and one temporary closure related to Hurricane Helene. During the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023, we opened 38 new stores and closed one store. As a percentage of net sales, pre-opening expenses remained flat at 0.9 
 in the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, respectively.

23 

Index 

Interest Income, Net

Interest income, net increased to 12.3 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 from 10.1 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended
 October 28, 2023, primarily due to favorable interest rates and higher average cash and cash equivalent and short-term investments balances.

Income Tax Expense

Income tax expense in the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 was 42.8 million compared to income tax expense of 35.2 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023. The
 effective tax rates for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023 were 24.6 and 25.1 , respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate in the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 was primarily due to an
 increase in discrete tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Discrete tax benefits totaled 2.2 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 compared to discrete tax benefits of 0.7 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended
 October 28, 2023.

Net Income

As a result of the foregoing, net income increased to 131.2 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 from 105.0 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023, an
 increase of 26.2 million or 25.0 .

Adjusted EBITDA

Adjusted EBITDA increased to 203.7 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 from 164.6 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023, an increase of 39.1 million, or
 23.8 .

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Overview

Our primary sources of liquidity are net cash flows provided by operating activities and available borrowings under our 100.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. Our primary cash needs are for
 capital expenditures and working capital. As of November 2, 2024, we had 92.1 million available to borrow under our Revolving Credit Facility and 303.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand. For further
 information regarding our Revolving Credit Facility, see Note 7 under Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Our capital expenditures are primarily related to new store openings, store resets, which consist of improvements to stores as they are needed, expenditures related to our distribution centers,
 and infrastructure-related investments, including investments related to upgrading and maintaining our information technology systems. We spent 31.0 million and 36.1 million for capital expenditures during the third quarters of fiscal 2024
 and fiscal 2023, respectively. For the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024, we spent 96.2 million for capital expenditures compared to 81.4 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023. Included in capital expenditures in the
 thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024, is approximately 15.8 million for the acquisition of ten former 99 Cents Only Store locations and fifteen former Big Lots store leases. Of the ten 99 Cents Only store locations, three of these are
 owned properties and seven are leased properties with favorable rent and leasing structures, located in key markets across Texas. With the acquisition, we expect our total capital expenditures to be approximately 104 million, which includes
 the 14.6 million purchase price and build out costs for the newly acquired locations.

We expect to fund capital expenditures from cash on hand generated from operations. We opened 37 new stores and closed three stores, two closures where the Company chose not to renew the leases
 and one temporary closure related to Hurricane Helene, during the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024, and we recently completed the construction of our Princeton, IL distribution center, which provides an additional 615,000 square feet of
 distribution capacity. We expect to open approximately 50 stores during fiscal 2024. We also expect to invest in store-level initiatives at our existing stores, and general corporate capital expenditures, including information technology. We
 have experienced, and may continue to experience, delays in construction and permitting of new stores and other projects.

24 

Index 

Our primary working capital requirements are for the purchase of merchandise inventories, payroll, store rent associated with our operating leases, other store operating costs, distribution
 costs, and general and administrative costs. Our working capital requirements fluctuate during the year, rising in our third fiscal quarter as we increase quantities of inventory in anticipation of our peak holiday sales season in our fourth
 fiscal quarter. Fluctuations in working capital are also driven by the timing of new store openings.

Historically, we have funded our capital expenditures and working capital requirements during the fiscal year with cash flows from operations.

A financial instrument which potentially subjects the Company to a concentration of credit risk is cash. Ollie s currently maintains its day-to-day operating cash balances with major financial
 institutions. The Company s operating cash balances are in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC insurance limit. From time to time, Ollie s invests temporary excess cash in overnight investments with expected minimal
 volatility, such as money market funds. Although the Company maintains balances which exceed the FDIC insured limit, it has not experienced any losses related to these balances.

We believe our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments position, net cash provided by operating activities and availability under our Revolving Credit Facility will be adequate to
 finance our planned capital expenditures, working capital requirements, debt service and other financing activities over the next 12 months. If cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility are not
 sufficient or available to meet our capital requirements, we will then be required to obtain additional equity or debt financing in the future. There can be no assurance equity or debt financing will be available to us when needed or, if
 available, the terms will be satisfactory to us and not dilutive to our then-current stockholders.

Share Repurchase Program

On December 15, 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the repurchase of up to 100.0 million of shares of the Company s common stock. On March 16, 2021, the Board of Directors
 of the Company authorized an increase of 100.0 million in the Company s share repurchase program, resulting in 200.0 million approved for share repurchases through January 13, 2023. On November 30, 2021, the Board of Directors of the Company
 authorized an additional 200.0 million to repurchase stock pursuant to the Company s share repurchase program, expiring on December 15, 2023. On November 30, 2023, the Company s Board of Directors authorized an extension to the existing share
 repurchase program set to expire on December 15, 2023, until March 31, 2026. The shares to be repurchased may be purchased from time to time in open market conditions (including blocks) or in privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share
 repurchase programs or other derivative transactions, issuer self-tender offers or any combination of the foregoing. The timing of repurchases and the actual amount purchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of
 our shares, general market, economic, and business conditions, and other corporate considerations. Repurchases may be made pursuant to plans intended to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which could allow us to
 purchase our shares during periods when we otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. Repurchases are expected to be funded from cash on hand or through the
 utilization of our Revolving Credit Facility. The repurchase authorization does not require the purchase of a specific number of shares and is subject to suspension or termination by our Board of Directors at any time.

During the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024, we repurchased 587,633 shares of our common stock for 47.3 million, inclusive of transaction costs, pursuant to our share repurchase
 program. During the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023, we repurchased 634,733 shares of our common stock for 39.8 million inclusive of transaction costs, pursuant to our share repurchase program. These expenditures were funded by cash
 generated from operations. As of November 2, 2024, we had 38.4 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. There can be no assurances that any additional repurchases will be completed, or as to the timing or amount of any
 repurchases.

Cash Provided by Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was 79.7 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 as compared to 110.9 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023. The
 decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 was primarily due to changes in working capital, most notably the timing of inventory receipts and payments, including tax payments,
 partially offset by higher net income year over year.

Cash Used in Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities was 183.4 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 as compared to 125.3 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023. The
 increase in cash used in investing activities is primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures in the current year related to the completion of the Company s fourth distribution center in Princeton, IL, the acquisition of ten former 99
 Cents Only Store locations and the acquisition of 15 former Big Lots store leases, in addition to increased net investment of short-term investments thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 as compared to the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28,
 2023.

Cash Used in Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities was 33.8 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 as compared to 36.6 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023. The
 decrease was primarily due to an increase in the repurchase of common stock, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from stock option exercises in the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 as compared to the thirty-nine weeks ended
 October 28, 2023.

Contractual Obligations

We enter into long-term contractual obligations and commitments in the normal course of business, primarily operating leases. Except as set forth in Note 4 of the accompanying unaudited
 condensed consolidated financial statements, there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations as disclosed in our Annual Report, other than those which occur in the ordinary course of business.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on
 our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures.
 There have been no significant changes in the significant accounting policies and estimates.

ITEM 3. 

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest Rate Risk

We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, which bears interest at variable rates. As of November 2, 2024, we had no outstanding
 variable rate debt.

As of November 2, 2024, there were no material changes in the market risks described in the Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure of Market Risks section of our Annual Report.

Impact of Inflation

Our results of operations and financial condition are presented based on historical cost. While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the
 imprecise nature of the estimates required, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on our historical results of operations and financial condition have been immaterial. We cannot be assured that our results of operations and financial
 condition will not be materially impacted by inflation in the future.

ITEM 4. 

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
 procedures, as defined in Rule 13(a)-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act. Based
 on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are effective at a reasonable
 assurance level in ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is: (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported in a timely manner, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
 Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure
 controls and procedures will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. While our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of their effectiveness, because of the inherent limitations in all control
 systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect,
 our internal control over financial reporting.

 of operations, liquidity or capital resources.
