 Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements

An entity recognizes revenue in accordance with that
core principle by applying the following steps: Step 1: Identify the contract with the customer. Step 2: Identify the performance obligations
in the contract. Step 3: Determine the transaction price. Step 4. Allocate the transaction price. Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as)
the entity satisfies a performance obligation. 

The Company s revenues are recognized at a point-in-time
as translated material is transferred at a distinct point in time per the terms of a contract. The Company shall not be liable for any
failure to perform its obligations if such failure is due to circumstances beyond its reasonable control. Any liability of the Company
shall be limited to the total of all amounts paid by the customer for services under the contract. 

The Company collects payment from customers prior
to transferring the translated material and may require deposits from customers at the time an order is placed. When deposits are collected
prior to transferring the translated material, the Company recognizes deferred revenue until the transfer is made. During the nine months ended
August 31, 2024 and 2023, we have generated 0 and 28,509 revenue , respectively .

We
capitalized website development and databases costs of 64,500 , which is being amortized
over a 5-year life. During the nine months ended August 31, 2024, and August 31, 2023, we recognized 9,675 and 6,375 worth of amortization
expense, respectively. The Company expects to recognize additional amortization expense of 3,225 during the year ended November
30, 2024, 12,900 of amortization expense in the fiscal years ending November 2025 and 2026, 11,859 of amortization expense in the fiscal
year ending November 30, 2027, and 4,118 of amortization expense in the fiscal year ending November 30, 2028. 

and in prepaid expenses,
respectively. The prepaid balance as of August 31, 2024 is related to the Company s annual OTM Markets fee and a 12-month Server
Lease and the prepaid balance as of November 30, 2023 is related to a 12-month Server Lease. The 12-month Server Lease was not accounted
for under ASC 842 due to the Company s election to not apply the recognition requirements of ASC 842 to short-term leases (leases
with terms of twelve months or less). The balance will be amortized straight-line over the 12-month term of the lease which commenced
on November 8, 2023. During the nine months ended August
31, 2024 we recognized 90,840 of server expense.

Item 2. 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Business Overview 

We are developing our
Translation Platform (the Platform for regular users and/or small businesses for an annual license fee and/or a percentage
of profits. Our Platform is going to be a cloud-based marketplace that can be accessed by a web browser on any kind of device that allows
end-users to socially connect with translators that offer appropriate services in order to discuss suitable conditions of cooperation. 

Competition 

We face competition
in the social networking sector. Moving forward with development of our Platform, we plan to compete on a larger scale with Facebook,
LinkedIn, eBay, and other social networks and E-Commerce sites for users engagement, all of which have substantially more
financial resources, and a significantly larger user-base than we do. 

Competitive Advantages 

Our competitive advantage
is that we are solely dedicated to the translation industry that business and consumer users that do not feel comfortable sharing content
and information on other social networks like Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter, as it may either jeopardize their personal and professional
reputations or be completely lost in the white-noise of billions of other posts. 

Additionally, we are
planning to develop specialized features for this translation industry that will incorporate E-Commerce directly into a user s social
networking account. This integration of E-Commerce directly into social networking is expected to set our Platform apart from our current
competitors. 

Competitive Disadvantages 

Our competitive disadvantages
are that we do not have the operational and financial resources that our competitors have, which results in our having fewer resources
to market our online Translation Platform, advertise our digital services, acquire new users on our Platform, and sell our advertising
and digital services to business customers, as compared to our competitors. 

Marketing 

Our prospective marketing consists of the
following: 

- 
 Digital press advertising 
 
 - 
 Online videos 
 
 - 
 Social media 
 
 - 
 Blogging 
 
 - 
 Advertising networks

Item 3.

Not applicable to smaller
reporting companies.

Item 4. 
 Controls and Procedures. 

The Company is responsible
for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms.
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s
management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar
functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

An assessment was conducted
with the participation of our principal executive and principal financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of
our disclosure controls and procedures as of August 31, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. 

A material weakness
is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility
that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2024, the Company determined
that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as described below. 

1. We lack an adequate internal control structure Due to the size of the Company, we do not have the appropriate control activities,
risk assessment procedures, controls over information and communication, or effective monitoring controls. 

16 

2. We do not have appropriate segregation of duties or adequate accounting resources The Company has only one employee therefore
no reviews are in place to ensure adequate financial reporting. Additionally, we lack accounting personnel with sufficient accounting
knowledge, experience, and understanding of US GAAP or SEC rules. Further, while not being legally obligated to have an audit committee,
it is the management s view that such a committee, including a financial expert member, is an utmost important entity level control
over the Company s financial statements. Currently the Board of Directors acts in the capacity of the Audit Committee, and does
not include a member that is considered to be independent of management to provide the necessary oversight over management s activities. 

3. We did not implement appropriate information technology controls As of November 30, 2023, the
Company retains copies of all financial data and material agreements; however, there is no formal procedure or evidence of normal backup
of the Company s data or off-site storage of data in the event of theft, misplacement, or loss due to unmitigated factors. Further,
there are no IT controls in place to prevent changes to, or misstatement in, financial reporting. 

Accordingly, the Company
concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial
statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the Company s internal controls. 

As a result of the
material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial
reporting as of August 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control- Integrated Framework issued by COSO. 

Changes in Internal
Controls over Financial Reporting 

There has been no change
in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended August 31, 2024, that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
