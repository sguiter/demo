 . Contracts are typically non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions. Revenue is presented net of sales tax and other taxes the Company collects on behalf of governmental authorities. Partner and services The Company s partner and services revenue includes revenue share, partner technology integrations, and marketing services provided to partners. Revenue share relates to fees earned by the Company s partners from customers using the Company s platform, where the Company has an arrangement with such partners to share such fees as they occur. Revenue share is recognized at the time the earning activity is complete, which is generally monthly and variable based on customer usage on the platform. Revenue for partner technology integrations is recorded on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract commencing when the integration has been completed. Revenue for marketing services are recognized either at the time the earning activity is complete, or ratably over the length of the contract, depending on the nature of the obligations in the contract. Payments received in advance of services being rendered are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized when the obligation is completed. The Company also derives revenue from the sales of website themes and applications upon delivery. The Company recognizes partner revenue share on a net basis as the Company has determined that the Company is the agent in the Company s arrangements with third-party application providers. All other revenue is recognized on a gross basis, as the Company has determined the Company is the principal in these arrangements. Contracts with multiple performance obligations A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. The Company s subscription contracts are generally comprised of a single performance obligation to provide access to the Company s platform, but can include additional performance obligations. For contracts with multiple performance obligations where the contracted price differs from the standalone selling price SSP for any distinct good or service, the Company may be required to allocate the contract s transaction price to each performance obligation using the Company s best estimate of SSP. Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. A contract s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. The primary method used to estimate SSP is the observable prices of products or services sold or priced separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. Contracts with the Company s technology solution partners may include multiple performance obligations, which can include integrations and marketing activities. In determining whether integration services are distinct from hosting services the Company considers various factors. These considerations include the level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the implementation and hosting services. The Company has concluded that the integration services included in contracts with hosting obligations are not distinct. As a result, the Company defers any arrangement fees for integration services and recognizes such amounts over the life of the hosting obligation commencing when the integration has been completed. To determine if marketing activities are distinct, the Company considers the nature of the promise in the contract, the timing of payment, and the partner expectations. Additional consideration for some partner contracts varies based on the level of customer activity on the platform. Certain agreements contain minimum guarantees of revenue share. These contracts are evaluated to determine if the guaranteed minimum is substantive. If the minimum is deemed substantive, revenue is recognized ratably over the life of the agreement. For most

 million as of September 30, 2024 as compared to million as of December 31, 2023. The Company is exposed to credit losses primarily through sales of products and services to customers and partners. The Company assesses the collectability of outstanding contract assets on an ongoing basis and maintains a reserve which is included in the allowance for credit losses for contract assets deemed uncollectible. The Company analyzes the contract asset portfolio for significant risks by considering historical collection experience and forecasting future collectability to determine what will ultimately be collected from its customers and partners, delinquency level and customer type have been identified as the primary specific risk affecting the Company s contract assets, and the estimate for losses is analyzed annually and adjusted as necessary. The Company has provisioned million and million for credit losses related to contract assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Deferred revenue Deferred revenue primarily consists of amounts that have been received from customers in advance of the performance obligation being satisfied. The Company recognizes revenue from deferred revenue when the services are performed and the corresponding revenue recognition criteria are met. Amounts recognized from deferred revenue represent primarily revenue from the sale of subscription solutions, integration, and marketing services. The Company recognized million and million of previously deferred revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Remaining performance obligation As of September 30, 2024 , the Company had million of remaining performance obligations, which represents contracted revenue minimums that have not yet been recognized, including amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. Remaining performance obligation is subject to future economic risks, including bankruptcies, regulatory changes and other market factors. percent of the remaining performance obligations as revenue in the following month period, and the remaining balance in the periods thereafter. 

As of September 30, 2023 

Cost of revenue Cost of revenue consists primarily of personnel-related costs, including: stock-based compensation expenses for customer support and professional services personnel; costs of maintaining and securing infrastructure and platform; allocation of overhead costs and credit card processing fees; and amortization expense associated with capitalized internal-use software.

The Company assesses the collectability of outstanding accounts receivable on an ongoing basis and maintains an allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable deemed uncollectible. The Company analyzes grouped customers by similar risk profiles, along with the invoiced accounts receivable portfolio and unbilled accounts receivable for significant risks, historical collection activity, and

. The Company values RSUs at the closing market price on the date of grant. RSUs typically vest in equal installments over a period, subject to continued service, and compensation expense is recognized straight-line over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures. The Company grants PSUs which provide for shares of common stock to be earned based on the Company's total stockholder return compared to the Russell 2000 index, and referred to as market-based awards. The Company values these market-based awards on the grant date using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The determination of fair value is affected by the Company's stock price and a number of assumptions including the expected volatility and the risk-free interest rate. The Company assumes no dividend yield and recognizes stock-based compensation expense ratably from grant date over the performance period of the award. The market-based awards will cliff-vest at the end of the period ranging from percent to percent of the target number of PSUs granted. The Company also grants PSUs which provide for shares of common stock to be earned based on its attainment of the Company's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization adjusted EBITDA and revenue relative to a target specified in the applicable agreement, and are referred to as Company performance-based awards. The Company values these awards at the closing market price on the date of grant. The vesting of Company performance-based awards is conditioned upon the achievement of certain targets and will vest in annual tranches in a percentage of the target number of shares between percent to percent. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense over the performance period, if it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. Adjustments to stock-based compensation expense are made, as needed, each reporting period based on changes in our estimate of the number of units that are probable of vesting.

Restructuring charges In September 2024, the Company commenced a restructuring plan (the 2024 Restructure intended to reinvest in product delivery and increase sales capacity, to reduce operating costs, improve operating margins and continue to advance the Company's ongoing commitment to profitable growth. The 2024 Restructure includes a reduction of the Company's workforce, exits of certain office leases, impairment of certain software development projects and contract amendments and terminations to better align operating expenses with existing economic conditions and the Company's strategic priorities. In connection with the 2024 Restructure, the Company incurred million of restructuring charges for the three months ended September 30, 2024 consisting primarily of severance benefits, right-of-use asset impairments, lease termination gain, software impairments, and professional services costs. Within the condensed consolidated balance sheet, the liability for severance benefits of million as of September 30, 2024 is recorded to other current liabilities and million of professional services costs are recorded in accounts payable and other current liabilities.

The Company estimated its future stock price volatility using a combination of its observed option-implied volatilities and its peer historical volatility calculations. Management believes this is the best estimate of the expected volatility over the expected life of its stock options. The estimated life for the stock options is based on the weighted average of the remaining vesting term and the remaining contractual life of each award. The risk-free interest rate is based on the rate for a U.S. government security with the same estimated life at the time of the option grant. The estimated forfeiture rate applied is based on historical forfeiture rates. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore uses an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had an effective tax rate of percent and p ercent, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company s effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of percent primarily due to the Company s valuation allowance offsetting the benefits of losses. The Company s current income tax expenses and benefits consist primarily of state current income tax expense, deferred income tax expense relating to the tax amortization of acquired goodwill and current income tax expense from foreign operations. The Company has provided a valuation allowance against most of the Company s deferred tax assets as it believes the objective and verifiable evidence of the Company s historical pretax net losses outweighs any positive evidence of forecasted future results. The Company will continue to monitor the positive and negative evidence and will adjust the valuation allowance as sufficient objective positive evidence becomes available. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approxim ately million in uncertain tax positions rep resenting no increase from the balance on December 31, 2023. Operating losses generated in years prior to 2020 remain open to adjustment until the statute of limitations closes for the tax year in which the net operating losses are utilized. Tax years 2020 through 2023 generally remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject. The Company is currently not under audit by any taxing jurisdiction.

 Overview 
 BigCommerce is leading a new era of ecommerce. Our SaaS platform simplifies the creation of online stores by delivering a unique combination of ease-of-use, enterprise functionality, composability and flexibility. We allow merchants to build their ecommerce solution their way with the flexibility to fit their unique business and product offerings. We power both our customers branded ecommerce stores and their cross-channel connections to popular online marketplaces, social networks, and offline point of sale systems. Our strategy is to provide the world s best combination of freedom of choice and flexibility in a multi-tenant SaaS platform. We describe this strategy as Open SaaS. As of September 30, 2024 we served 5,892 accounts with at least one unique enterprise plan subscription or an enterprise-level feed management subscription (collectively enterprise accounts ). These accounts may have more than one Enterprise plan or a combination of Enterprise plans and Essentials plans. 
 We provide a comprehensive platform for launching and scaling an ecommerce operation, including store design, catalog management, hosting, checkout, order management, reporting, and pre-integration into third-party services like payments, shipping, and accounting. All of our stores run on a single code base and share a global, multi-tenant architecture purpose built for security, high performance, and innovation. Our platform serves stores in a wide variety of sizes, product categories, and purchase types, including B2C and B2B. 
 We offer access to our platform on a subscription basis. We serve customers with subscription plans tailored to their size and feature needs. For our larger customers, our Enterprise plan offers our full feature set at a subscription price tailored to each business. For small and medium business ("SMBs"), we offer three retail plans: Standard, Plus, and Pro, priced at 29, 79, and 299 per month (our Essentials plans) when pre-paid annually, or 39, 105, and 399 per month (our Essentials plans ), when paid monthly, respectively. Our Essentials plans include GMV thresholds with programmatic upgrades built in as merchants exceed each plan s threshold. 
 Our differentiated Open SaaS technology approach combines the flexibility and customization potential of open source software with the performance, security, usability, and value benefits of multi-tenant SaaS. This combination helps businesses turn digital transformation into competitive advantage. While some software conglomerate providers attempt to lock customers into their proprietary suites, we focus on the configurability and flexibility of our open platform, enabling each business to optimize their ecommerce approach based on their specific needs. 
 Partners are essential to our open strategy. We believe we possess one of the deepest and broadest ecosystems of integrated technology solutions in the ecommerce industry. We strategically partner with, rather than compete against, the leading providers in adjacent categories, including payments, shipping, point of sale, content management system, customer relationship management, and enterprise resource planning. We focus our research and development investments in our core product to create a best-of-breed ecommerce platform and co-market and co-sell with our strategic technology partners to our mutual prospects and customers. As a result, we earn high-margin revenue share from a subset of our strategic technology partners, which complements the high gross margin of our core ecommerce platform. 
 Our business has achieved significant growth since our inception. We plan to continue to invest in our Open SaaS strategy, building new partnerships and continuing to develop a platform that offers best-of-breed functionality with the cost-effectiveness of multi-tenant SaaS. As we work to develop and deliver this platform for our customers, we will also invest and grow our business by acquiring additional customers to our platform, growing our revenue with existing customers, cross-selling owned and partner solutions to existing customers, expanding our presence in new markets and geographies, and considering targeted acquisitions that can enhance our service to customers.

 Key factors affecting our performance 
 Our operational and financial results have been, and will continue to be, affected by a number of factors that present significant opportunities as well as risks and challenges, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this quarterly report and in our Annual Report, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors The key factors discussed below impacted our 2023 results or are anticipated to impact our future results . 
 Go-to-Market Strategy 
 We reorganized our business teams and leadership structure to introduce clear and unified end to end ownership of the customer. Sales, customer success, marketing, and our business development teams have congruent and clear targets that unify their efforts around customer success and growth. We centralized end to end customer success ownership under our Company's Chief Executive Officer, Travis Hess. Mr. Hess oversees all go-to-market efforts across the business, including the platform product, Feedonomics, and partner and services revenue. Additionally, we appointed Ms. Siminoff as Executive Chair of the Board to work with Mr. Hess and other members of the Company's executive team to provide, among other things, strategic expertise, leadership, and direction to the Board and senior management. 
 We continue to advance efficient revenue growth by ensuring investments spent in our go-to-market strategy yield greater returns for our customers and for us. We are focusing on brand architecture and integration and product strategy to shape our strategy moving forward: 
 Brand architecture and integration - We are streamlining our brand architecture to focus on integrating the capabilities of our platform with Feedonomics and Makeswift to offer a more comprehensive solution for our customers. 

Product strategy - We remain committed to driving value and business growth serving our core customers: mid-market and enterprise B2C and B2B customers, and sophisticated small business customers. We will focus our investments and innovation to serve these customers, including through the continued rollout of Catalyst for our B2C customers, continuing integration of our B2B features into our platform, and the launching of a hosted Catalyst solution that offers our small business customers a more cost-effective, easy-to-use platform. 

We have made strategic organizational changes that will allow us to scale efficiently to support these initiatives as described below in our results of operations. 
 Macroeconomic environment and customer spend 
 Consumer spending remains resilient across our major markets. We are encouraged overall by the underlying consumption signals that we are seeing in our business. 
 2024 Restructure 
 As discussed in Note 7 to our condensed consolidated financial statements, on September 30, 2024, we committed to a restructuring plan (the "2024 Restructure") intended to reinvest in product delivery and increase sales capacity, reduce operating costs, improve operating margins and continue to advance our commitment to profitable growth. The 2024 Restructure includes a reduction of our workforce, exits of certain office leases, impairment of certain software development projects and contract amendments and terminations to better align operating expenses with existing economic conditions and the Company s strategic priorities. Affected employees were notified on November 7, 2024, and are being provided severance arrangements. 
 We anticipate to incur additional expense related to the 2024 Restructure of approximately 3.5 million to 5.7 million through fiscal 2025 relating to severance benefits, contract terminations, accelerated depreciation, right-of-use asset impairments, software impairments, and professional services costs. The additional expenses we expect to incur are subject to assumptions, and actual expenses may differ from the estimates disclosed above. 
 Business metrics 
 We review the following business metrics to measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions. Increases or decreases in our business metrics may not correspond with increases or decreases in our revenue. As an example, some of our business metrics include annual revenue run-rate ARR ), subscription annual revenue run-rate Subscription ARR ), average revenue per account, lifetime value LTV to customer acquisition costs CAC and others are calculated as of the end of the last month of the reporting period.

 Annual revenue run-rate 
 We calculate ARR at the end of each month as the sum of: (1) contractual monthly recurring revenue at the end of the period, which includes platform subscription fees, invoiced growth adjustments, product feed management subscription fees, recurring professional services revenue, and other recurring revenue, multiplied by twelve to prospectively annualize recurring revenue, and (2) the sum of the trailing twelve-month non-recurring and variable revenue, which includes one-time partner integrations, one-time fees, payments revenue share, and any other revenue that is non-recurring and variable. 
 Subscription annual revenue run-rate 
 We calculate Subscription ARR at the end of each month as the sum of contractual monthly recurring revenue at the end of the period, which includes platform subscription fees, invoiced growth adjustments, product feed management subscription fees, recurring professional services revenue, and other recurring revenue, multiplied by twelve to prospectively annualize recurring revenue. 
 Average revenue per account 
 We calculate average revenue per account ARPA at the end of a period by including customer-billed revenue and an allocation of partner and services revenue, where applicable. We bill customers for subscription solutions and professional services, and we include both in ARPA for the reported period. For example, ARPA as of September 30, 2024, includes all subscription solutions and professional services billed between January 1, 2024, and September 30, 2024. We allocate partner revenue, where applicable, primarily based on each customer s share of GMV processed through that partner s solution. Partner revenue that is not directly linked to customer usage of a partner s solution is allocated based on each customer s share of total platform GMV. Each account s partner revenue allocation is calculated by taking the account s trailing twelve-month partner revenue, then dividing by twelve to create a monthly average to apply to the applicable period in order to normalize ARPA for seasonality. 
 Enterprise Account metrics 
 To measure the effectiveness of our ability to execute against our growth strategy, particularly within the mid-market and enterprise lines of business, we calculate ARR attributable to Enterprise Accounts.

Lifetime value to customer acquisition costs 
 We measure the efficiency of new customer acquisition by comparing the lifetime value of newly-acquired customers to the customer acquisition costs of the associated time period to get an LTV:CAC ratio. We calculate LTV as gross profit from new sales during the four quarters of any given year divided by the estimated future subscription churn rate. 
 Net revenue retention 
 We use net revenue retention NRR to evaluate our ability to maintain and expand our revenue with our account base of enterprise customers exceeding the ACV threshold over time. The total billings and allocated partner revenue, where applicable, for the measured period are divided by the total billings and allocated partner revenue for such accounts, corresponding to the period one year prior. An NRR greater than 100 percent implies positive net revenue retention. This methodology includes stores added to or subtracted from an account s subscription during the previous twelve months. It also includes changes to subscription and partner and services revenue billings, and revenue reductions from stores or accounts that leave the platform during the previous one-year period. Net new accounts added after the previous one-year period are excluded from our NRR calculations. NRR for enterprise accounts was 100 percent and 111 percent for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We update our reported NRR at the end of each fiscal year and do not report quarterly changes in NRR.

 Components of results of operations 
 Revenue 
 We generate revenue from two sources: (1) subscription solutions revenue and (2) partner and services revenue. 
 Subscription solutions revenue consists primarily of platform subscription fees from plans and recurring professional services. Subscription solutions are charged monthly, quarterly, or annually for our customers to sell their products and process transactions on our platform. Subscription solutions are generally charged per online store and are based on the store s subscription plan. Our Enterprise plan contracts are generally for a fixed term of 12 to 36 months and are non-cancelable. Our pricing strategy provides enterprise merchants a discount for a period of time from their contractual monthly. Merchants have full access to the functionality of our platform upon contract execution, and revenue is recognized ratably over the contract life. Our retail plans are generally month-to-month contracts. Monthly subscription fees for Enterprise plans are adjusted if a customer s GMV or orders processed are outside of specified plan thresholds on a trailing twelve-month basis. Fixed monthly fees and any transaction charges related to subscription solutions are recognized as revenue in the month they are earned. 
 Through Feedonomics, we provide feed management solutions under service contracts which are generally one year or less and, in many cases, month-to-month. These service types may be sold stand-alone or as part of a multi-service bundle (e.g. both marketplaces and advertising) and are billed monthly in arrears. 
 We generate partner revenue from our technology application ecosystem. Customers tailor their stores to meet their feature needs by integrating applications developed by our strategic technology partners. We enter into contracts with our strategic technology partners that are generally for one year or longer. We generate revenue from these contracts in three ways: (1) revenue-sharing arrangements, (2) technology integrations, and (3) partner marketing and promotion. We recognize revenue on a net basis from revenue-sharing arrangements when the underlying transaction occurs. 
 We also generate revenue from non-recurring professional services that we provide to complement the capabilities of our customers and their agency partners. Our services help improve customers time-to-market and the success of their businesses using BigCommerce. Our non-recurring services include education packages, launch services, solutions architecting, implementation consulting, and catalog transfer services. 
 Cost of revenue 
 Cost of revenue consists primarily of: (1) personnel-related costs (including stock-based compensation expense and associated payroll costs) for our customer success teams, (2) costs that are directly related to hosting and maintaining our platform, (3) fees for processing customer payments such as credit card processing charges, (4) personnel and other costs related to feed management, and (5) allocated costs, such as, depreciation, technology and facility costs. 
 As a result of our growth plans and integration of our previously acquired businesses, we have incurred expenses for equity and amortization of purchased intangibles. 
 Sales and marketing 
 Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of: (1) personnel-related expenses (including stock-based compensation expense and associated payroll costs), (2) sales commissions, (3) marketing programs, (4) travel-related expenses, and (5) allocated overhead sales and support costs such as technology and facility costs. We focus our sales and marketing efforts on creating sales leads and establishing and promoting our brand. We plan to increase our investment in sales and marketing by executing our go-to-market strategy globally and building our brand awareness. Incremental sales commissions for new customer contracts are deferred and amortized ratably over the estimated period of our relationship with such customers. 
 Research and development 
 Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses (including stock-based compensation expense and associated payroll costs) incurred in maintaining and developing enhancements to our ecommerce platform and allocated overhead costs. Software development costs associated with internal use software which are incurred during the application development phase and meet other requirements are capitalized. 
 We believe delivering new functionality is critical to attracting new customers and enhancing the success of existing customers. We expect to continue to make investments in research and development.

 General and administrative 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of: (1) personnel-related expenses (including stock-based compensation expense and associated payroll costs) for finance, legal and compliance, and human resources, (2) external professional services, and (3) allocated overhead costs, such as technology and facility costs. 
 Acquisition related expenses 
 Acquisition related expenses consists of cash payments for third-party acquisition costs and other acquisition related expenses, including contingent compensation arrangements entered into in connection with acquisitions. 
 Restructuring charges 
 Restructuring charges consist primarily of severance payments, right-of-use asset impairments, lease termination gain, software impairments, and professional services costs. 
 Amortization of intangible assets 
 Amortization of intangible assets consist of amortization of acquired intangible assets which were recognized as a result of business combinations and are being amortized over their expected useful life. 
 Gain on convertible notes extinguishment 
 Gains recorded net of proportionate share of unamortized debt issuance costs and certain third party transaction costs relate to the repurchase transactions of the 2026 Convertible Notes and exchange transaction of the 2026 Convertible Notes for the 2028 Convertible Notes. 
 Interest income 
 Interest income is earned on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. 
 Interest expense 
 Interest expense consists primarily of the interest expense from the amortization of the debt issuance costs and coupon interest attributable to our 2028 and 2026 Convertible Notes with offsetting amortization of the debt premium related to the 2028 Convertible Notes, as well as interest associated with a financing agreement entered into in the first half of 2023. 
 Other expense 
 Other expense primarily consists of foreign currency translation adjustments. 
 Provision for income taxes 
 Our provision for income taxes consists primarily of deferred income taxes associated with amortization of tax deductible goodwill and current income taxes related to certain foreign and state jurisdictions in which we conduct business. For U.S. federal income tax purposes and in certain foreign and state jurisdictions, we have NOL carryforwards. The foreign jurisdictions in which we operate have different statutory tax rates than those of the United States. Additionally, certain of our foreign earnings may also be currently taxable in the United States. Accordingly, our effective tax rate will vary depending on the relative proportion of foreign to domestic income, use of foreign tax credits, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, applicability of any valuation allowances, and changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate.

 Acquisition related expense decreased 0.7 million, or (68.7) percent, to 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and decreased 8.3 million, or 89.3 percent, to 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 9.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Acquisition costs recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 represent the amortization of deferred compensation for the Makeswift acquisition. Acquisition costs in prior years related to other transactions and acquisition costs for Feedonomics were recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Restructuring charges 
 Restructuring charges were 9.9 million and 5.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and were 12.5 million and 6.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 9.9 million is a result of 6.9 million of severance and related charges, 2.1 million of capitalized software related charges due to impairment of software due to change in market strategy, 1.1 million of real estate related charges, 0.6 million of professional services related to our change in market strategy as described above in relation to the 2024 Restructure, and 0.2 million of professional services related to our capital structure and various alternatives associated with inbound inquiries partially offset by a 1.0 million gain on real estate modification. The charges for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily related to charges from the 2023 Restructure which included a one time charge of 5.5 million resulting from severance and other related charges. 
 Gain on convertible note extinguishment 
 Gain on convertible note extinguishment was 12.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The 12.1 million consisted of a 10.4 million gain on the repurchase of 2026 Convertible Notes and 1.7 million gain on the exchange of 2028 Convertible Notes. 
 Interest income 
 Interest income decreased 0.7 million, or 20.5 percent, to 2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 3.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily a result of lower cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance during the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to cash outflows for financing activities. Interest income increased 0.5 million, or 6.0 percent to 8.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 8.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily a result of higher cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 
 Interest expense 
 Interest expense was 1.9 million and 0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and was 3.3 million and 2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The increase in interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily a result of the issuance of the 2028 Convertible Notes that have a higher effective interest rate than the 2026 Convertible Notes. 
 
 Liquidity and capital resources 
 We are committed to cash flow generation and cash management by focusing on operational discipline, and we continue to evaluate all of our spending to look for opportunities to drive improvements in cash flow. Our success in transitioning our customer base from legacy month-to-month contracts to annual contracts has continued to result in better cash flow as these efforts have increased the timing of our cash receipts and reduced our overall subscription churn rate.

Table of Content 

 Our operational short-term liquidity needs primarily include working capital for sales and marketing, research and development, and continued innovation. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, levels of revenue, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, market acceptance of our platform, the results of business initiatives including our efforts in transitioning our customers to annual billings, continued reduction in churn, the timing of new product introductions, the continued impact of the inflation on the global economy, market risk due to elevated interest rates, our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and our cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months. In the future, we may attempt to raise additional capital through the sale of additional equity or debt financing. 
 Additionally, with our convertible notes restructuring, there was a reduction in liquidity. However, we believe as a result of the renegotiation and extension of the remaining obligation, we have decreased our overall debt leverage and better optimized our maturities. The restructuring of the convertible notes requires semi-annual interest payments and increases our contractual interest rate to 7.50 percent. 
 From time to time, we may seek to repurchase, redeem or otherwise retire our convertible notes through cash repurchases and/or exchanges for equity securities, in open market repurchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers or otherwise. Such repurchases, redemptions or other transactions, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. We do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements that we expect would materially affect our liquidity and capital resources .

As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 37.0 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, a decrease of 33.9 million compared to 70.9 million as of September 30, 2023. Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly-liquid investments with original maturities of less than three months. Our restricted cash balance of 1.5 million and 1.1 million at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, consisted of security deposits for future chargebacks and amounts on deposit with certain financial institutions. Our marketable securities balance of 133.0 million and 195.6 million at September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively, consisted of investments in corporate and US treasury securities. We maintain cash account balances in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insured limits. 
 Operating activities 
 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 5.6 million and 31.4) million, respectively. This consisted primarily of our net losses adjusted for certain non-cash items including depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, convertible note premium and convertible note issuance costs amortization, stock-based compensation, bad debt expense, impairment losses, gains on settlement of lease liabilities, gain on extinguishment of convertible notes, and the effect of changes in working capital. The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by cost reductions associated with the 2023 Restructure and focus on reduction of variable spend. 
 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 13.9 million and 37.5) million respectively.

 Indebtedness 
 2028 Convertible Notes 
 In August 2024, we issued 150.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Company s new 7.50 percent convertible senior notes due 2028 (the 2028 Convertible Notes ). The 2028 Convertible Notes were issued pursuant to, and are governed by, an indenture (the 2028 Convertible Notes Indenture ), dated as of August 7, 2024, between the Company and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee. 
 The 2028 Convertible Notes are the Company s senior, initially unsecured obligations and will accrue interest at a rate of 7.50 percent per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on October 1, 2024. The 2028 Convertible Notes will mature on October 1, 2028, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. Before July 3, 2028, noteholders will have the right to convert their 2028 Convertible Notes only upon the occurrence of certain events. From and after July 3, 2028, noteholders may convert their 2028 Convertible Notes at any time at their election until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. The Company will settle conversions by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at the Company s election. The initial conversion rate is 62.5000 shares of common stock per 1,000 principal amount of 2028 Convertible Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of 16.00 per share of common stock. The conversion rate and conversion price will be subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, if certain corporate events that constitute a Make-Whole Fundamental Change (as defined in the 2028 Convertible Notes Indenture) occur, then the conversion rate will, in certain circumstances, be increased for a specified period of time. 
 The Company may not redeem the 2028 Convertible Notes at its option at any time before October 7, 2026. The 2028 Convertible Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part (subject to the Partial Redemption Limitation (as defined in the 2028 Convertible Notes Indenture)), at the Company s option at any time, and from time to time, on or after October 7, 2026 and on or before the 25th

 scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, but only if the last reported sale price per share of the Company s common stock exceeds 130 percent of the conversion price for a specified period of time and certain other conditions are satisfied. The redemption price will be equal to the principal amount of the 2028 Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. In addition, calling any 2028 Convertible Note for redemption will constitute a Make-Whole Fundamental Change with respect to that 2028 Convertible Note, in which case the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of that 2028 Convertible Note will be increased in certain circumstances if it is converted after it is called for redemption. Pursuant to the Partial Redemption Limitation, the Company may not elect to redeem less than all of the outstanding 2028 Convertible Notes unless at least 100.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2028 Convertible Notes are outstanding and not subject to redemption as of the time the Company sends the related redemption notice. 
 If certain corporate events that constitute a Fundamental Change (as defined in the 2028 Convertible Notes Indenture) occur, then, subject to a limited exception for certain cash mergers, noteholders may require the Company to repurchase their 2028 Convertible Notes at a cash repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the 2028 Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. The definition of Fundamental Change includes certain business combination transactions involving the Company and certain de-listing events with respect to the Company s common stock. 
 The 2028 Convertible Notes have customary provisions relating to the occurrence of Events of Default (as defined in the 2028 Convertible Notes Indenture), which include the following: (i) certain payment defaults on the 2028 Convertible Notes (which, in the case of a default in the payment of interest on the 2028 Convertible Notes, will be subject to a 30-day cure period); (ii) the Company s failure to send certain notices under the 2028 Convertible Notes Indenture within specified periods of time; (iii) the Company s failure to comply with certain covenants in the 2028 Convertible Notes Indenture relating to the Company s ability to consolidate with or merge with or into, or sell, lease or otherwise transfer, in one transaction or a series of transactions, all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to another person; (iv) a default by the Company in its other obligations or agreements under the 2028 Convertible Notes Indenture or the 2028 Convertible Notes if such default is not cured or waived within 60 days after notice is given in accordance with the 2028 Convertible Notes Indenture; (v) certain payment defaults on the Company s credit facility if the Company has entered into the Security Documents (as defined in the 2028 Convertible Notes Indenture), (vi) certain defaults by the Company or any of its significant subsidiaries with respect to indebtedness for borrowed money of at least 20,000,000; and (vii) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency and reorganization involving the Company or any of its significant subsidiaries. 
 If an Event of Default involving bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization events with respect to the Company (and not solely with respect to a significant subsidiary of the Company) occurs, then the principal amount of, and all accrued and unpaid interest on, all of the 2028 Convertible Notes then outstanding will immediately become due and payable without any further action or notice by any person. If any other Event of Default occurs and is continuing, then, the Trustee, by notice to the Company, or noteholders of at least 25 percent of the aggregate principal amount of 2028 Convertible Notes then outstanding, by notice to the Company and the trustee, may declare the principal amount of, and all accrued and unpaid interest on, all of the 2028 Convertible Notes then outstanding to become due and payable immediately. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may elect, at its option, that the sole remedy for an Event of Default relating to certain failures by the Company to comply with certain reporting covenants in the Indenture consists exclusively of the right of the noteholders to receive special interest on the 2028 Convertible Notes for up to 180 days at a specified rate per annum not exceeding 0.50 percent on the principal amount of the 2028 Convertible Notes. 
 The 2028 Convertible Notes Indenture contains a number of restrictive covenants and limitations, including restrictions on the Company s ability to incur certain indebtedness, as further described in the Indenture. In addition, to the extent the Company incurs subordinated indebtedness pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, it will be required to secure the 2028 Convertible Notes, subject only to prior security interests in favor of lenders under any senior secured revolving credit facility, if then outstanding. 
 2026 Convertible Notes 
 In September 2021, we issued 345.0 million principal amount of 0.25 percent convertible notes due 2026 (the 2026 Convertible Notes ). The 2026 Convertible Notes were issued pursuant to, and are governed by, an indenture (the 2026 Convertible Notes Indenture ), dated as of September 14, 2021, between us and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The 2026 Convertible Notes accrue interest at a rate of 0.25 percent per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on April 1, 2022. 
 In August 2024, in addition to the Exchange Agreement, the Company entered into separate, privately negotiated repurchase agreements with a limited number of holders of its outstanding 2026 Convertible Notes to repurchase (the "Repurchase Transactions") approximately 120.6 million aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Convertible Notes for aggregate cash consideration of approximately 108.7 million, including accrued but unpaid interest of approximately 0.2 million on such 2026 Convertible Notes. The Repurchase Transactions settled in August 2024. Following the Repurchase Transactions, approximately 63.1 million principal amount of 2026 Convertible Notes remain outstanding.

 The 2026 Convertible Notes are our senior, unsecured obligations and are (i) equal in right of payment with our future senior, unsecured indebtedness; (ii) senior in right of payment to our future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the 2026 Convertible Notes in right of payment; (iii) effectively subordinated to our future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness; and (iv) structurally subordinated to all future indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, and (to the extent we are not a holder thereof) preferred equity, if any, of our subsidiaries. 
 The remaining outstanding 2026 Convertible Notes will mature on October 1, 2026, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Before July 1, 2026, noteholders have the right to convert the remaining outstanding 2026 Convertible Notes only upon the occurrence of certain events. From and after July 1, 2026, noteholders may convert their 2026 Convertible Notes at any time at their election until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. We will settle conversions by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. The initial conversion rate of the remaining outstanding 2026 Convertible Notes was 13.6783 shares of common stock per 1,000 principal amount of 2026 Convertible Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately 73.11 per share of common stock. The conversion rate and conversion price are subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, if certain corporate events that constitute a Make-Whole Fundamental Change (as defined in the 2026 Convertible Notes Indenture) occur, then the conversion rate will, in certain circumstances, be increased for a specified period of time. 
 The remaining outstanding 2026 Convertible Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part (subject to the Partial Redemption Limitation (as defined in the 2026 Convertible Notes Indenture)), at our option at any time, and from time to time, on or after October 7, 2024 and on or before the 25th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, but only if the last reported sale price per share of our common stock exceeds 130 percent of the conversion price on (i) each of at least 20 trading days, whether or not consecutive, during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately before the date we send the related redemption notice; and (ii) the trading day immediately before the date we send such notice. The redemption price will be a cash amount equal to the principal amount of the 2026 Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. In addition, calling any 2026 Convertible Note for redemption will constitute a Make-Whole Fundamental Change with respect to that 2026 Convertible Note, in which case the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of that 2026 Convertible Note will be increased in certain circumstances if it is converted after it is called for redemption. Pursuant to the Partial Redemption Limitation, we may not elect to redeem less than all of the outstanding 2026 Convertible Notes unless at least 150.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2026 Convertible Notes are outstanding and not subject to redemption as of the time we send the related redemption notice. 
 If certain corporate events that constitute a Fundamental Change (as defined in the 2026 Convertible Notes Indenture) occur, then, subject to a limited exception for certain cash mergers, noteholders may require us to repurchase their Notes at a cash repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the remaining outstanding 2026 Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. The definition of Fundamental Change includes certain business combination transactions involving us and certain de-listing events with respect to our common stock. 
 The 2026 Convertible Notes have customary provisions relating to the occurrence of Events of Default (as defined in the Convertible Notes Indenture), which include the following: (i) certain payment defaults on the 2026 Convertible Notes (which, in the case of a default in the payment of interest on the 2026 Convertible Notes, will be subject to a 30-day cure period); (ii) our failure to send certain notices under the 2026 Convertible Notes Indenture within specified periods of time; (iii) our failure to comply with certain covenants in the 2026 Convertible Notes Indenture relating to our ability to consolidate with or merge with or into, or sell, lease or otherwise transfer, in one transaction or a series of transactions, all or substantially all of the assets of us and our subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to another person; (iv) a default by us in our other obligations or agreements under the 2026 Convertible Notes Indenture or the 2026 Convertible Notes if such default is not cured or waived within 60 days after notice is given in accordance with the 2026 Convertible Notes Indenture; (v) certain defaults by us or any of our significant subsidiaries with respect to indebtedness for borrowed money of at least 65.0 million; and (vi) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency and reorganization involving us or any of our significant subsidiaries. 
 If an Event of Default involving bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization events with respect to us (and not solely with respect to a significant subsidiary of us) occurs, then the principal amount of, and all accrued and unpaid interest on, all of the 2026 Convertible Notes then outstanding will immediately become due and payable without any further action or notice by any person. If any other Event of Default occurs and is continuing, then, the trustee, by notice to us, or noteholders of at least 25 percent of the aggregate principal amount of 2026 Convertible Notes then outstanding, by notice to us and the trustee, may declare the principal amount of, and all accrued and unpaid interest on, all of the 2026 Convertible Notes then outstanding to become due and payable immediately. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, we may elect, at our option, that the sole remedy for an Event of Default relating to certain failures by us to comply with certain reporting covenants in the 2026 Convertible Notes Indenture consists exclusively of the right of the noteholders to receive special interest on the 2026 Convertible Notes for up to 180 days at a specified rate per annum not exceeding 0.50 percent on the principal amount of the 2026 Convertible Notes.

 Critical accounting policies and estimates 
 Our condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We also make estimates and assumptions on the reported revenue generated and reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates described in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations set forth in our Annual Report.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Interest rate risk 
 Our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, consist primarily of interest-bearing accounts. Such interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. To minimize interest rate risk in the future, we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents in a variety of investment-grade securities, which may include commercial paper, money market funds, and government and non-government debt securities. Because of the short-term maturities of our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities, we do not believe that an increase in market rates would have any significant negative impact on the realized value of our investments. An immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points at September 30, 2024 could result in a 1.3 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. 
 In September 2021, we issued the 2026 Convertible Notes with an aggregate principal amount of 345.0 million, of which 63.1 million remains outstanding as of September 30, 2024. The 2026 Convertible Notes have a fixed interest rate of 0.25 percent; we do not face variable interest rate risk with respect to the 2026 Convertible Notes. The fair value of the 2026 Convertible Notes changes when the market price of our stock fluctuates or market interest rates change. 
 In August 2024, we issued the 2028 Convertible Notes with an aggregate principal amount of 150.0 million, the full amount of which is outstanding as of September 30, 2024. The 2028 Convertible Notes have a fixed interest rate of 7.50 percent; we do not face variable interest rate risk with respect to the 2028 Convertible Notes. The fair value of the 2028 Convertible Notes changes when the market price of our stock fluctuates or market interest rates change. 
 Foreign currency exchange risk 
 All of our revenue and a majority of our expense and capital purchasing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were transacted in U.S. dollars. As we expand our sales and operations internationally, we will be more exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. Our international revenue is currently collected in U.S. dollars. In the future, as we expand into additional international jurisdictions, we expect that our international sales will be primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. If we decide in the future to denominate international sales in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, unfavorable movement in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which we conduct foreign sales could have an adverse impact on our revenue. 
 A portion of our operating expenses are incurred outside the United States and are denominated in foreign currencies, which are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In particular, in our Mexico, Australia and UK-based operations, we pay payroll and other expenses in Mexican pesos, Australian dollars and British pounds sterling, respectively. Our operating results and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. However, we believe that the exposure to foreign currency fluctuation from operating expenses is relatively small at this time as the related costs do not constitute a significant portion of our total expenses. 
 We currently do not hedge foreign currency exposure. We may in the future hedge our foreign currency exposure and may use currency forward contracts, currency options, and/or other common derivative financial instruments to reduce foreign currency risk. It is difficult to predict the effect future hedging activities would have on our operating results. 
 Credit risk 
 Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and accounts receivable. Our investment policy limits investments to high credit quality securities issued by the U.S. government, U.S. government-sponsored agencies, and highly rated corporate securities, subject to certain concentration limits and restrictions on maturities. Our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash are held by financial institutions that management believes are of high credit quality. Amounts on deposit may at times exceed FDIC insured limits. We have not experienced any losses on our deposits of cash and cash equivalents, and accounts are monitored by management to mitigate risk. We are exposed to credit risk in the event of default by the financial institutions holding our cash and cash equivalents or an event of default by the issuers of the corporate debt securities we hold. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
 As of September 30, 2024, and under the direction of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded as of September 30, 2024, that our disclosure 
 41 

Table of Content 

 controls and procedures were not effective because of the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that was disclosed in our Annual Report. 
 As discussed in Part II, Item 9A, Controls and Procedures in our Annual Report, we identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting in the following areas: 
 (i) information technology IT general controls. 

We did not maintain effective controls over (i) user access to ensure appropriate segregation of duties and adequately restrict user and privileged access to financial applications, programs and data to the appropriate personnel; (ii) program change management for financial applications to ensure that IT program and data changes affecting financial IT applications and underlying accounting records are identified, tested, authorized and implemented appropriately; and (iii) IT operations controls to ensure that critical interface jobs are monitored. 
 Status of Remediation Efforts 
 In response to the material weakness identified and described above, our management, with the oversight of the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, will continue through 2024 to dedicate significant efforts and resources to further improve our control environment and to take steps to remediate this material weakness. 
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
 Except for the implementation of our remediation plans in connection with our ineffective disclosure controls and procedures described above, there have been no significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the three month period ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 From time to time, the Company may become involved in litigation related to claims arising from the ordinary course of our business. The Company believes that there are no claims or actions pending or threatened against us, the ultimate disposition of which would have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Item 1A. Ri sk Factors. 
 Except as set forth below there are no material changes to our risk factors as previously disclosed in Part I, Item 
 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Our failure to generate sufficient cash flow from our business to satisfy the interest rate of our 2028 Convertible Notes would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 The interest rate on the 150.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Convertible Notes outstanding as of 
 September 30, 2024, is 7.50 percent, payable semi-annually. Our ability to pay interest and required principal payments on our indebtedness depends upon cash flows generated by our operating performance. As a result, prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, may affect our ability to make these payments and reduce the level of our indebtedness over time. 
 If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy our debt servicing obligations, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness, selling assets or seeking to raise additional capital. 
 Further, our spending in relation to our debt restructuring combined with elevated interest rates could have significant adverse consequences, including: reducing cash resources available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, product development efforts and other general corporate purposes; impeding our ability to capitalize on strategic opportunities; reducing profitability; increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry, and market conditions; limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or better debt servicing options. 
 The terms of the indenture (the 2028 Convertible Notes Indenture that govern the 2028 Convertible Notes impose restrictions that may limit our current and future operating flexibility, particularly our ability to respond to changes in the economy or our industry or to take certain actions, which could harm our long-term interests. 
 The 2028 Convertible Notes Indenture and the exchange agreement governing the exchange of 2026 Convertible Notes for 2028 Convertible Notes (to the extent the exchanging holder continues to hold a specified amount of 2028 Convertible Notes) contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries (to the extent any such subsidiaries incur or guarantee indebtedness) to: 
 incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness, including a limitation on incurring revolving credit 		facility indebtedness in excess of 25 million in aggregate amount (the Senior Secured Revolving Indebtedness 		and the incurrence of any senior indebtedness; and 

issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities. 

As a result of these restrictions we may be: 
 limited in how we conduct our business; 

unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; or 

unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. 

These restrictions may hinder our ability to grow in accordance with our strategies. In addition, while we are not permitted to incur any additional senior indebtedness (other than the Senior Secured Revolving Indebtedness), the incurrence of subordinated indebtedness will be subject to the requirement that the 2028 Convertible Notes be secured by all of our assets (subject to customary exceptions) concurrently with any incurrence of subordinated indebtedness. 
 A breach of the covenants under the 2028 Convertible Notes Indenture or under the 2026 Convertible Notes Indenture could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. Such a default, if not cured or waived, may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt that is subject to an applicable cross-acceleration or cross-default

 provision. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under the 2028 Convertible Notes Indenture and the 2028 Convertible Notes are then secured, holders of the 2028 Convertible Notes could proceed against the collateral securing such indebtedness. If the holders of the 2028 Convertible Notes accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. 
 We have undertaken, and may in the future undertake, restructuring activities that could result in disruptions to our business or otherwise materially harm our results of operations or financial condition. 
 From time to time, we have implemented restructuring plans to support key strategic initiatives which include driving efficient revenue growth and delivering long-term profitability. For example, we initiated a restructuring plan in September 2023, intended to, among other things, advance the Company's ongoing commitment to profitable growth, which was materially complete at the end of fiscal 2023. This follows an earlier restructuring plan we initiated in December 2022 intended to reduce our cost structure through a reduction of Company workforce and office space, which was completed during the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. In September 2024, we implemented a new restructuring plan which will include workforce reductions, reduction in real estate footprint, and costs incurred associated with asset impairments. Our restructuring plans present potential risks that could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, or business reputation. 
 Changes resulting from our strategic restructuring plans and any future initiatives may not be successful in yielding our intended results and may not appropriately address the short-term and long-term strategic objectives for our business. Implementation of the restructuring plans and any other cost-saving initiatives may be costly and disruptive to our business, the expected costs and charges may be greater than we have forecasted, and the estimated cost savings may be lower than we have anticipated. Additionally, certain aspects of the 2024 Restructuring Plan, such as severance costs in connection with reducing our headcount, could negatively impact our cash flows. In addition, our initiatives could result in personnel attrition beyond our planned reduction in headcount or reduced employee morale, which could in turn adversely impact productivity, including through a loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge, inefficiency during transitional periods, or our ability to attract highly skilled employees. If any restructuring activities we have undertaken or undertake in the future fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
 Losing key members of our management or operations teams could hinder our ability to attract and retain the necessary talent for continued operations and growth. 
 Our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management, particularly our chief executive officer. From time to time, there may be changes in our management team resulting from the hiring, departure or realignment of executives. For example, in September 2024, Brent Bellm, our former CEO and Chairman of our Board of Directors, departed from these positions with the Company. Such changes may be disruptive to our business. Mr. Bellm was with the Company for nine years and during this time developed institutional knowledge and relationships. The departure of Mr. Bellm could lead to a loss of leadership continuity, key relationships, and in-depth understanding of our business, operations, and industry. 
 Effective succession planning for management is important to our long-term success. While we have a succession plan in place, a new CEO, Travis Hess, even with significant experience, may not possess the same level of institutional knowledge and partner relationships, potentially impacting our decision-making, strategic direction, and overall business performance during the transition period.
