 million and million of variable rate borrowings at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As a matter of policy, management does not use derivatives for speculative purposes. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had interest rate swap agreements. During 2021, the Company entered into fixed-rate interest swap agreements, each having notional amounts of million, which matured during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and with remaining terms of months as of September 30, 2024. interest rate swap agreement was entered into during 2019, having a notional amount of million, which matured during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company entered into fixed-rate interest swap agreements, each having notional amounts of million, and with remaining terms of months as of September 30, 2024. The derivative instruments were each designated as cash flow hedges at inception and recorded at fair value. 
 
 The Company evaluated the effectiveness of the swap agreements to hedge the interest rate risk associated with its variable rate debt and concluded at the swap inception dates that each swap was highly effective in hedging that risk. The Company evaluates the effectiveness of the hedging relationships on an ongoing basis and concluded there was no ineffectiveness in the hedges for the period ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Company estimates the fair value of derivative instruments using a discounted cash flow technique. Valuation of the derivative instruments requires certain assumptions for underlying variables and the use of different assumptions would result in a different valuation. Management believes it has applied assumptions consistently during the period. The Company applies hedge accounting and accounts for the change in fair value of its cash flow hedges through other comprehensive income for all derivative instruments that are effective and for which the related forecasted transaction is probable of occurring. 
 
 The net fair value of the interest rate swaps as of September 30, 2024 was million, representing an asset of million and a liability of million, and reflected within Other assets and Accounts payable and accrued expenses on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively. The net fair value of the interest rate swaps as of December 31, 2023 was million, representing an asset and reflected within Other assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company recorded an adjustment to interest expense of ) million and ) million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and ) million and ) million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, from derivative instruments.

 The effective portion of the change in fair value on a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and is reclassified into earnings in the period during which the transaction being hedged affects earnings when it is determined to be improbable that the forecasted transaction will occur. The ineffective portion of the hedges, if any, is recorded in earnings in the current period. 
 
 Counterparty Credit Risk 
 
 The Company evaluates the creditworthiness of the counterparties under its hedging agreements. The counterparties for the interest rate swaps are large financial institutions that possess investment grade credit ratings. Based on these ratings, the Company believes that the counterparties are credit-worthy and that their continuing performance under the hedging agreements is probable and does not require the counterparties to provide collateral or other security to the Company.

The Company s effective tax rates differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0 primarily due to executive compensation exceeding 1.0 million as defined in Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). 
 
 The Company records tax expense or benefit for unusual or infrequent items discretely in the period in which they occur. The Company s tax rate is subject to change based on changes in the mix of assets leased to domestic and foreign lessees, the proportion of revenue generated within and outside of California, the amount of executive compensation exceeding 1.0 million as defined in Section 162(m) of the Code, and numerous other factors, including changes in tax law.

 Employee Stock Purchase Plan Total Stock Compensation Expense 
 
 Under the 2023 Incentive Stock Plan (the 2023 Plan ), stock-based compensation is in the form of restricted stock awards RSAs ). The RSAs are subject to either service-based vesting, which is typically between one and , in which a specific period of continued employment must pass before an award vests, or performance-based vesting, which is typically between one and . The expense associated with these awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective vesting period, with forfeitures accounted for as they occur. For any vesting tranche of an award, the cumulative amount of compensation cost recognized is equal to the portion of the grant date fair value of the award tranche that is actually vested at that date. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had granted RSAs under the 2023 Plan and had shares available for future issuance. The fair value of the RSAs equaled the stock price at the grant date.

 Overview 
 
 Our core business is acquiring and leasing commercial aircraft and aircraft engines and related aircraft equipment pursuant to operating leases, all of which we sometimes collectively refer to as equipment. As of September 30, 2024, the majority of our leases were operating leases, with the exception of certain failed sale-leaseback transactions classified as notes receivable under the guidance provided by Accounting Standards Codification ASC 842 and investments in sales-type leases. As of September 30, 2024, we had 66 lessees in 34 countries. Our portfolio is continually changing due to equipment acquisitions and sales. As of September 30, 2024, we had 2,435.6 million of equipment held in our operating lease portfolio, 175.4 million of notes receivable, 31.5 million of maintenance rights, and 23.2 million of investments in sales-type leases, which represented 348 engines, 16 aircraft, one marine vessel, and other leased parts and equipment. As of September 30, 2024, we also managed 234 engines, aircraft and related equipment on behalf of other parties. 
 
 Our wholly-owned and vertically-integrated subsidiary Willis Asset Management Limited Willis Asset Management is focused on the engine management and consulting business. Willis Aeronautical Services, Inc. Willis Aero is a wholly-owned and vertically-integrated subsidiary whose primary focus is the sale of aircraft engine parts and materials through the acquisition or consignment of aircraft and engines. 
 
 We actively manage our portfolio and structure our leases to maximize the residual values of our leased assets. Our leasing business focuses on popular Stage IV commercial jet engines manufactured by CFMI, General Electric, Pratt Whitney, Rolls Royce and International Aero Engines. These engines are the most widely used engines in the world, powering Airbus, Boeing, Bombardier and Embraer aircraft. 
 
 Risks and Uncertainties 
 
 Given the uncertainty in the rapidly changing market and economic conditions related to the current high interest rate and inflationary environment, we will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to the Company s business and financial position. The ultimate extent of the current high interest rate and inflationary environment on the Company will depend on future developments, and such effects could exist for an extended period of time.

 Results of Operations 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenue is summarized as follows: 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change (dollars in thousands) Lease rent revenue 64,905 53,573 21.2 Maintenance reserve revenue 49,760 37,696 32.0 Spare parts and equipment sales 10,863 3,359 223.4 Interest revenue 3,412 2,106 62.0 Gain on sale of leased equipment 9,519 773 1,131.4 Maintenance services revenue 5,948 6,199 (4.0) Other revenue 1,816 2,039 (10.9) Total revenue 146,223 105,745 38.3 
 
 Lease Rent Revenue. Lease rent revenue consists of rental income from long-term and short-term engine leases, aircraft leases, and other leased parts and equipment. Lease rent revenue increased by 11.3 million, or 21.2 , to 64.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 53.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is due to an increase in the average size of the portfolio as compared to that of the prior year period as well as an increase in the average lease rate factor. 
 
 Two customers accounted for approximately 11 each of total lease rent revenue of the Company, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and one customer accounted for approximately 16 of total lease rent revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company had 2,435.6 million of equipment held in our operating lease portfolio, 175.4 million of notes receivable, 31.5 million of maintenance rights, and 23.2 million of investments in sales-type leases. At September 30, 2023, the Company had 2,171.0 million of equipment held in our operating lease portfolio, 94.0 million of notes receivable, 13.4 million of maintenance rights, and 5.5 million of investments in sales-type leases. Average utilization (based on net book value) was approximately 83 and 85 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Maintenance Reserve Revenue . Maintenance reserve revenue increased 12.1 million, or 32.0 , to 49.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 37.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Long-term maintenance revenue is influenced by end of lease compensation and the realization of long-term maintenance reserves associated with engines coming off lease. We recognized 1.2 million in long-term maintenance revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.3 million in long-term maintenance revenue recognized in the comparable prior period. Engines on lease with non-reimbursable usage fees generated 48.5 million of short-term maintenance revenues, compared to 34.4 million in the comparable prior period. These short-term maintenance revenues are a proxy for flight time of our portfolio of engines. 
 
 Spare Parts and Equipment Sales . Spare parts and equipment sales increased by 7.5 million, or 223.4 , to 10.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in spare parts sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 reflects the demand for surplus material that we are seeing as operators extend the lives of their current generation engine portfolios. Equipment sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 1.0 million for the sale of one engine. There were no equipment sales for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Interest Revenue. Interest revenue increased by 1.3 million, or 62.0 , to 3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase primarily reflects an increase in notes receivable related to failed sale-leasebacks in which the Company was the buyer-lessor and on sales-type leases. 
 
 Gain on Sale of Leased Equipment. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 13 engines and other parts and equipment from the lease portfolio for a net gain of 9.5 million. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we sold one engine, one airframe, and other parts and equipment from the lease portfolio for a net gain of 0.8 million.

 Maintenance Services Revenue . Maintenance services revenues predominately represent fleet management, engine and aircraft storage and repair services, and revenue related to fixed base operator services provided to third parties, such as refueling, maintenance, and hangar services. Maintenance services revenue decreased by 0.3 million, or 4.0 , to 5.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 6.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other Revenue. Other revenue decreased by 0.2 million, or 10.9 , to 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Other revenue consists primarily of managed service fee revenue related to the servicing of engines for the Willis Mitsui Company Engine Support Limited WMES lease portfolio. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by 0.6 million, or 2.4 , to 23.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 23.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to an increase in the size of our lease portfolio. 
 Cost of Spare Parts and Equipment Sales . Cost of spare parts and equipment sales increased by 6.8 million, or 337.8 , to 8.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting the increase in spare parts and equipment sales. Cost of equipment sales were 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. There were no equipment or cost of equipment sales for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Cost of Maintenance Services. Cost of maintenance services predominately represent the costs of fleet management, engine and aircraft storage and repair services, and the management of fixed base operator services provided to third parties. Cost of maintenance services increased by 0.8 million, or 14.7 , to 6.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily related to an increase in personnel costs, as a result of expansion of our aircraft tear down and repair services business, as well as an increase in facility related costs. 
 Write-down of Equipment. There was 0.6 million in write-downs of equipment for the three months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting the write-down of three engines. Write-down of equipment was 0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting the write-down of one engine and two airframes. 
 General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by 13.5 million, or 50.8 , to 40.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 26.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase primarily reflects a 13.6 million increase in personnel costs. Increased personnel costs included approximately 7.8 million of costs related directly and indirectly to share-based compensation, which was influenced by the rapid appreciation of the Company s market value of equity. Share-based compensation included a one-time special award of 3.0 million made at the direction of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company to our Executive Chairman for the Company s year-to-date performance. Further, incentive compensation increased by 2.5 million as a result of business performance to date. 
 
 Technical Expense. Technical expense consists of the non-capitalized cost of engine repairs, engine thrust rental fees, outsourced technical support services, sublease engine rental expense, engine storage and freight costs. Technical expense decreased by 3.6 million to 5.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 8.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a lower level of engine repair activity as compared to that of the prior period. 
 
 Net Finance Costs. Net finance costs increased 8.8 million, or 46.0 , to 27.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 19.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a higher level of debt obligations, including increased borrowing costs. Additionally, derivative-related receipts were 3.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 6.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 as certain interest rate swap positions ran off. These increases were offset by a decrease in interest expense associated with our credit facility that matures in June 2025 due to principal payments made and a decrease in the outstanding balance of the credit facility. 
 
 Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense was 10.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to income tax expense of 5.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was 30.1 compared to 28.1 in the prior year period. The Company s effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0 primarily due to executive compensation exceeding 1.0 million as defined in Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ).

 Write-down of Equipment. Write-down of equipment was 0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily reflecting the write-down of one airframe and three engines. Write-down of equipment was 2.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily reflecting the write-down of three engines and two airframes. 
 
 General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by 18.2 million, or 21.1 , to 104.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 86.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase primarily reflects a 23.2 million increase in personnel costs, partially offset by a 3.4 million decrease in other taxes related to international tax treaties. Increased personnel costs included approximately 9.3 million of costs related directly and indirectly to share-based compensation, which was influenced by the rapid appreciation of the Company s market value of equity. Share-based compensation included a one-time special award of 3.0 million made at the direction of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company to our Executive Chairman for the Company s year-to-date performance. Further, incentive compensation increased by 7.6 million as a result of business performance to date. 
 
 Technical Expense. Technical expense decreased by 1.8 million, or 9.3 , to 17.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 19.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a lower level of engine repair activity as compared to that of the prior period. 
 
 Net Finance Costs. Net finance costs increased by 18.9 million, or 33.4 , to 75.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 56.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due a higher level of debt obligations, including increased borrowing costs. Additionally, derivative-related receipts were 9.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 17.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as certain interest rate swap positions ran off. These increases were offset by a decrease in interest expense associated with our credit facility that matures in June 2025 due to principal payments made and a decrease in the outstanding balance of the credit facility. 
 
 Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense was 34.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 13.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 28.4 compared to 28.9 in the prior year period. The Company s effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0 primarily due to executive compensation exceeding 1.0 million as defined in Section 162(m) of the Code. 
 
 Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company had 5.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and 99.3 million of restricted cash. We fund our operations primarily from cash provided by our leasing activities. We finance our growth through borrowings secured primarily by our equipment lease portfolio. Cash of approximately 518.9 million and 159.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, was derived from our borrowing activities. In these same time periods, 331.2 million and 221.9 million, respectively, was used to pay down related debt.

 For any interest rate swaps that we enter into, we will be exposed to risk in the event of non-performance of the interest rate hedge counter-parties. We may hedge additional amounts of our floating rate debt in the future. 
 
 Cash Flows Discussion 
 
 Cash flows provided by operating activities were 216.4 million and 169.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 47.5 million, or 28.1 , increase in operating cash flows was primarily driven by a 62.0 increase in maintenance reserve revenue, reflecting increased levels of usage fees resulting from high levels of travel and supply chain constraints. Additionally, payments received on sales-type leases increased 28.0 million, gain on sale of leased equipment increased 28.0 million, and changes in receivables contributed to 26.9 million of incremental operating cash flows as collections improved. Partially offsetting these increases in operating cash flows was a period over period decline of 30.7 million in cash flows from changes in inventory, reflecting investment in high demand engine types. Cash flows from operations are driven significantly by payments made under our lease agreements, which comprise lease revenue, security deposits and maintenance reserves, and are offset by interest expense and general and administrative costs. Cash received as maintenance reserve payments for some of our engines on lease are partially restricted by our debt arrangements. The lease revenue stream, in the short-term, is at fixed rates while a portion of our debt is at variable rates. If interest rates increase, it is unlikely we could increase lease rates in the short-term and this would cause a reduction in our earnings and operating cash flows. Revenue and maintenance reserves are also affected by the amount of equipment off lease. Approximately 80 and 84 , by book value, of our assets were on-lease as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The average utilization rate (based on net book value) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 83 and 85 , respectively. If there is an increase in off-lease rates or deterioration in lease rates that are not offset by reductions in interest rates, there will be a negative impact on earnings and cash flows from operations. 
 
 Cash flows used in investing activities were 455.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and primarily reflected 488.4 million for the purchase of equipment held for operating lease and for sale (including capitalized costs and prepaid deposits made in the period) and 89.6 million related to leases entered into which were classified as notes receivable under ASC 842, partially offset by proceeds from sale of equipment (net of selling expenses) of 117.9 million. Cash flows used in investing activities were 132.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and primarily reflected 142.5 million for the purchase of equipment held for operating lease and for sale (including capitalized costs and prepaid deposits made in the period) and 15.4 million related to leases entered into which were classified as notes receivable under ASC 842, partially offset by proceeds from sale of equipment (net of selling expenses) of 25.0 million. 
 Cash flows provided by financing activities were 175.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and primarily reflected 518.9 million in proceeds from debt obligations and 13.1 million in proceeds from issuance of preferred stock, partially offset by 331.2 million in principal payments, 8.9 million in cash dividends paid to shareholders of common stock, and 7.2 million in cancellation of restricted stock in satisfaction of withholding tax. Cash flows used in financing activities were 70.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and primarily reflected 221.9 million in principal payments, partially offset by 159.8 million in proceeds from debt obligations.

 Cash Dividends 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company paid cash dividends of 8.9 million to shareholders of common stock. 
 Preferred Stock Dividends 
 On September 27, 2024, the Company entered into a Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement with Development Bank of Japan Inc. (the Stock Purchase Agreement ), which refinanced the Company s Series A-1 and Series A-2 Preferred Stock into one 65.0 million Series A Preferred Stock series the Series A Preferred Stock ), which accrues quarterly dividends at the rate per annum of 8.35 per share. The Company s Series A-1 Preferred Stock accrued quarterly dividends at the rate per annum of 6.5 per share through October 15, 2023 and accrued at the rate per annum of 8.5 per share thereafter through September 26, 2024. The Series A-2 Preferred Stock accrued quarterly dividends at the rate per annum of 6.5 per share. During each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company paid total preferred stock dividends of 3.4 million and 2.4 million, respectively. 
 Debt Obligations and Covenant Compliance 
 At September 30, 2024, debt obligations consisted of loans totaling 1,990.5 million, net of unamortized issuance costs and note discounts, payable with interest rates varying between approximately 3.1 and 8.0 . Substantially all of our assets are pledged to secure our obligations to creditors. For further information on our debt instruments, see Note 4 Debt Obligations in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Virtually all of our debt requires our ongoing compliance with certain financial covenants including debt/equity ratios, minimum tangible net worth and minimum interest coverage ratios, and other eligibility criteria including customer and geographic concentration restrictions. Under our revolving credit facility, we can borrow no more than 85 of an engine s net book value and 65 of the net book value of an airframe, spare parts or other assets. Therefore, we must have other available funds for the balance of the purchase price of any new equipment to be purchased. Our revolving credit facility, certain indentures and other debt related agreements also contain cross-default provisions. If we do not comply with the covenants or eligibility requirements, we may not be permitted to borrow additional funds and accelerated payments may become necessary. Additionally, much of the debt is secured by engines and aircraft, and to the extent that engines or aircraft are sold, repayment of that portion of the debt could be required. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants specified in our revolving credit facility, including the Interest Coverage Ratio requirement of at least 2.25 to 1.00, and the Total Leverage Ratio requirement of not greater than 4.50 to 1.00. The Interest Coverage Ratio, as defined in the credit facility, is the ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and other one-time charges to consolidated interest expense. The Total Leverage Ratio, as defined in the credit facility, is the ratio of total indebtedness to tangible net worth. At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants specified in the WEST III, WEST IV, WEST V, WEST VI, WEST VII, and Willis Warehouse Facility LLC indentures and servicing and other debt related agreements. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements or obligations that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, change in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that are material to investors.

 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 
 Repayments of our gross debt obligations primarily consist of scheduled installments due under term loans and are funded by the use of unrestricted cash reserves and from cash flows from ongoing operations. The table below summarizes our contractual commitments at September 30, 2024: 
 Payment due by period (in thousands) Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years Debt obligations 2,014,734 473,793 469,872 715,531 355,538 Interest payments under debt obligations 366,560 109,203 149,993 100,025 7,339 Purchase obligations 426,740 120,555 306,185 Operating lease obligations 6,583 3,243 2,147 867 326 Total 2,814,617 706,794 928,197 816,423 363,203 
 
 From time to time we enter into contractual commitments to purchase engines directly from original equipment manufacturers. We are currently committed to purchasing seven additional new LEAP-1B engines, and 18 additional new LEAP-1A engines for an aggregate total of 426.7 million by 2027. Our purchase agreements generally contain terms that allow the Company to defer or cancel purchase commitments in certain situations. These deferrals or cancellations would not result in penalties or increased costs other than any potential increase due to the normal year-over-year change in engine list prices, which is akin to ordinary inflation. 
 
 In December 2020, we entered into definitive agreements for the purchase of 25 Pratt Whitney aircraft engines. As part of the purchase, we have committed to certain future overhaul and maintenance services which are anticipated to range between 88.5 million and 121.5 million by 2030. 
 
 We have estimated the interest payments due under debt obligations by applying the interest rates applicable at September 30, 2024 to the remaining debt, adjusted for the estimated debt repayments identified in the table above. Actual interest payments made will vary due to changes in the rates. 
 
 We believe our equity base, internally generated funds and existing debt facilities are sufficient to maintain our level of operations for the next twelve months. The level of internally generated funds could decline if the amount of equipment off-lease increases, there is a decrease in availability under our existing debt facilities, or there is a significant increase in borrowing costs. Such decline would impair our ability to sustain our current level of operations. We continue to discuss additions to our capital base with our commercial and investment banks. If we are not able to access additional capital, our ability to continue to grow our asset base consistent with historical trends will be impaired and our future growth would be limited to that which can be funded from internally generated capital. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 The most recent adopted accounting pronouncements and accounting pronouncements to be adopted by the Company are described in Note 1 to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Our primary market risk exposure is that of interest rate risk. A change in interest rates would affect our cost of borrowing. Increases in interest rates, which may cause us to raise the implicit rates charged to our customers, could result in a reduction in demand for our leases. Alternatively, we may price our leases based on market rates so as to keep the fleet on-lease and suffer a decrease in our operating margin due to interest costs that we are unable to pass on to our customers. As of September 30, 2024, 616.9 million of our outstanding debt is variable rate debt. We estimate that for every one percent increase or decrease in interest rates on our variable rate debt, net of our interest rate swaps, our annual interest expense would increase or decrease by 2.7 million. 
 We hedge a portion of our borrowings from time to time, effectively fixing the rate of these borrowings. This hedging activity, which at times is required by our borrowing facilities, helps protect us against reduced margins on longer term fixed rate leases. Such hedging activities may limit our ability to participate in the benefits of any decrease in interest rates but may also protect us from increases in interest rates. Furthermore, since lease rates tend to vary with interest rate levels, it is possible that we can adjust lease rates for the effect of changes in interest rates at the termination of leases. Other financial assets and liabilities are at fixed rates.

 We are also exposed to currency devaluation risk. Substantially all of our leases require payment in U.S. dollars. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 70 and 66 , respectively, of our lease rent revenues came from non-United States domiciled lessees. If these lessees currency devalues against the U.S. dollar, the lessees could potentially encounter difficulty in making their lease payments. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. In accordance with Rule 13a-15(b) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act ), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), of the effectiveness and design of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 (b) Inherent limitations on controls. Management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. 
 
 (c) Changes in internal control over financial reporting. There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 Investors should carefully consider the risks in the Risk Factors in Part 1: Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 14, 2024, and our other filings with the SEC. These risks are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations. Any of these risks could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. The trading price of our common stock could fluctuate due to any of these risks, and investors may lose all or part of their investment. In assessing these risks, investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 
 (a) On September 27, 2024, the Company entered into the Stock Purchase Agreement, which refinanced the Company s Series A-1 and Series A-2 Preferred Stock into one 65.0 million of Series A Preferred Stock, which accrues quarterly dividends at the rate per annum of 8.35 per share. The Company s Series A-1 Preferred Stock accrued quarterly dividends at the rate per annum of 6.5 per share through October 15, 2023 and accrued at the rate per annum of 8.5 per share thereafter through September 26, 2024. The Series A-2 Preferred Stock accrued quarterly dividends at the rate per annum of 6.5 per share. During each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company paid total preferred stock dividends of 3.4 million and 2.4 million, respectively.

Except as otherwise required by law, notice of each meeting of the stockholders, whether annual or special, shall be given not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting by delivering a typewritten or printed notice thereof to him personally, or by depositing such notice in the United States mail, in a postage prepaid envelope, directed to him at his post office address furnished by him to the Corporate Secretary of the Corporation for such purpose or, if he shall not have furnished to the Corporate Secretary his address for such purpose, then at his post office address last known to the Corporate Secretary, or by transmitting a notice thereof to him at such address by telegraph, cable, or wireless. Except as otherwise expressly required by law, no publication of any notice of a meeting of the stockholders shall be required. Every notice of a meeting of the stockholders shall state the place, date and hour of the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, shall also state the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Notice of any meeting of stockholders shall not be required to be given to any stockholder who shall have waived such notice and such notice shall be deemed waived by any stockholder who shall attend such meeting in person or by proxy, except a stockholder who shall attend such meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Except as otherwise expressly required by law, notice of any adjourned meeting of the stockholders need not be given if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken.

The vote at any meeting of the stockholders on any question need not be by ballot, unless the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of all classes of stock entitled to vote thereon present in person or by proxy shall so determine. On a vote by ballot, each ballot shall be signed by the stockholder voting, or by his proxy, if there be such proxy, and it shall state the number of shares voted. (c) Shares of its own stock belonging to the Corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors in such other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes. Persons holding stock of the Corporation in a fiduciary capacity shall be entitled to vote such stock. Persons whose stock is pledged shall be entitled to vote, unless in the transfer by the pledgor on the books of the Corporation he shall have expressly empowered the pledgee to vote thereon, in which case only the pledgee, or his proxy, may represent such stock and vote thereon. Stock having voting power standing of record in the names of two or more persons, whether fiduciaries, members of a partnership, joint tenants in common, tenants by entirety or otherwise, or with respect to which two or more persons have the same fiduciary relationship, shall be voted in accordance with the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any other change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting, nor more than 60 days prior to any other action. If no record date is fixed: (1) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day before the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day before the day on which the meeting is held; and (2) the record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of such meeting; provided, however, that the Board may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting. When a record date is so fixed, only shareholders of record at the close of business on that date are entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting or to receive the dividend, distribution, or allotment of rights, or to exercise the rights, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of the Corporation after the record date.

The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. SECTION 2.09 Judges. If at any meeting of the stockholders a vote by written ballot shall be taken on any question, the chairman of such meeting may appoint a judge or judges to act with respect to such vote. Each judge so appointed shall first subscribe an oath faithfully to execute the duties of a judge at such meeting with strict impartiality and according to the best of his ability. Such judges shall decide upon the qualification of the voters and shall report the number of shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on such question, shall conduct and accept the votes, and, when the voting is completed, shall ascertain and report the number of shares voted respectively for and against the question. Reports of judges shall be in writing and subscribed and delivered by them to the Corporate Secretary of the Corporation. The judges need not be stockholders of the Corporation, and any officer of the Corporation may be a judge on any question other than a vote for or against a proposal in which he shall have a material interest.

The Board may also provide that the Corporation shall reimburse each such director for any expense incurred by him on account of his attendance at any meetings of the Board or Committees of the Board.

ARTICLE VII. Indemnification SECTION 7.01 Indemnification. Subject to any limitation which may be contained in the Certificate of Incorporation and the other provisions of this Article VII, the Corporation shall to the full extent permitted by law, including, without limitation, Delaware General Corporation Law 145, as such law or Section now exists or shall hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than such law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), indemnify any person who was, is or is threatened to be made a party, a named defendant or respondent to any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, arbitral, administrative, or investigative, any appeal in such action, suit, or proceeding, and any inquiry or investigation that could lead to such an action, suit, or proceeding, because such person is or was a director, officer employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, partner, venturer, proprietor, trustee, employee, agent, or similar functionary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, sole proprietorship, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise, against judgments, penalties (including excise and similar taxes), fines, settlements, and reasonable expenses (including attorneys fees) actually incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit, or proceeding; provided, however, that, except as provided in Section 7.03 of this Article VII with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if (i) such indemnification is expressly required to be made by law, (ii) the proceeding was expressly authorized by the Board of Directors of the corporation, (iii) such indemnification is provided by the corporation, in its sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in the corporation under the Delaware General Corporation Law or (iv) such indemnification is required to be made under subsection Section 7.03 of this Article VII. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that an individual did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably 

believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. SECTION 7.02 Expenses. Subject to any limitation which may be contained in the Certificate of Incorporation, the Corporation shall, to the full extent permitted by law, including, without limitation, 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, as such law or Section now exists or shall hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than such law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), pay or reimburse on a current basis the expenses incurred by any person described in Section 7.01 in connection with any such action, suit, or proceeding in advance of the final disposition thereof, if the Corporation has received (i) a written affirmation by the recipient of his good faith belief that he has met the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification under the Delaware General Corporation Law and (ii) a written undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay the amount paid or reimbursed if it is ultimately determined that he has not satisfied such standard of conduct or if indemnification is prohibited by law. SECTION 7.03 Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit. If a claim under Sections 7.01 or 7.02 of this Article VII is not paid in full by the Corporation within sixty (60) days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. To the fullest extent permitted by law, if successful in whole or in part in any such suit, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder it shall be a defense that the indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, under this Article VII or otherwise shall be on the Corporation. SECTION 7.04 Other Rights and Remedies. The indemnification provided by this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification may be entitled under any Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such person s official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. The rights provided in this Article VII shall be deemed to be provided by a contract between the Corporation and the individuals who serve in the capacities described in Section 7.01 at any time while these bylaws are in effect, and no repeal or modification of this Article VII by the stockholders shall adversely affect any right of any person otherwise entitled to indemnification by virtue of this Article VII at the time of such repeal or modification. SECTION 7.05 Insurance. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such person s status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this Article. SECTION 7.06 Constituent Corporations. For the purposes of this Article, references to the Corporation include all constituent corporations absorbed in a consolidation or merger as well as the resulting or surviving corporation, so that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such a constituent corporation or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as such person would if such person had served the resulting or surviving corporation in the same capacity. ARTICLE VIII. Miscellaneous SECTION 8.01 Fiscal Year. The fiscal year of the Corporation shall end on the 31st day of December. SECTION 8.02 Waiver of Notices. Whenever notice is required to be given by these Bylaws or the Certificate of Incorporation or by law, the person entitled to said notice may waive such notice in writing, either before or after the time stated therein, and such waiver shall be deemed equivalent to notice. SECTION 8.03 Seal. The Corporation may have a corporate seal which shall have the name of the Corporation and shall be in such form as may be approved from time to time by the Board. The corporate seal may be used by causing it or a facsimile thereof to be impressed or affixed or in any other manner reproduced. SECTION 8.04 Interested Directors; Quorum. No contract or transaction between the Corporation and one or more of its directors or officers, or between the Corporation and any other corporation, partnership, association or other organization in which one or more of its directors or officers are directors or officers, or have financial interest, shall be void or voidable solely for this reason, or solely because the director or officer is present at or participates in the meeting of the Board or committee thereof which authorizes the contract or transaction, or solely because his or their votes are counted for such purpose, if: (1) the material facts as to his relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board or the committee, and the Board or committee in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative votes of a majority of the disinterested directors, even though the disinterested directors be less than a quorum; or (2) the material facts as to his relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the stockholders entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or transaction is specifically approved in good faith by vote of the stockholders; or (3) the contract or transaction is fair as to the Corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified, by the Board, a committee thereof or the stockholders. Common or interested directors may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the Board or of a committee which authorizes the contract or transaction.

SECTION 8.08 Severability. Any determination that any provision of these Bylaws is for any reason inapplicable, illegal or ineffective shall not affect or invalidate any other provision of these Bylaws. SECTION 8.09 Pronouns. All pronouns used in these Bylaws shall be deemed to refer to the masculine, feminine or neuter, singular or plural, as the identity of the person or persons may require.

If (i) Employee's employment terminates by reason of Employee's voluntary resignation for Good Reason, or (ii) Employee provides Employer with a notice of nonrenewal pursuant to Section 2(b) hereof for Good Reason, Employee will be paid the severance which is described in Section 9 below. Good Reason means Employee's voluntary termination following: (i) a reduction in compensation which is not in proportion to any salary reduction program approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board which affects all executive officers of Employer; (ii) a reduction in material benefits; (iii) a material reduction in Employee's position, title, duties and status; (iv) requiring Employee to work at a location more than 25 road miles from the location of Employee s home; or (v) any willful and material breach by Employer of its obligations under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Good Reason shall not exist unless the Employee gives the Employer written notice of the condition within 90 days after the condition or conditions become 7 Good Reason and the Employer fails to remedy the condition within 30 days after receiving the Employee s written notice. 9. Severance Payment. (a) Amount. In the event severance is payable hereunder, such severance shall be in an amount equal to (i) one times Employee's annual base salary at the time of termination, pursuant to Section 7(b) or Section 8(b), or if during a Change in Control Extension, one and one-half times Employee s base salary at the time of termination, plus (ii) any unpaid base salary and any annual incentive compensation to which Employee is entitled as of the Termination Date, and accrued vacation and sick pay, plus (iii) if during a Change in Control Extension, an amount equal to the average annual incentives paid to Employee attributable to the two years prior to the year of termination, plus (iv) distribution of unpaid deferred compensation, plus (v) an amount equal to the average of the largest and smallest of the last five (5) annual Incentive Bonuses the Employee received from the Employer prior to termination, excluding from calculation of the average any Incentive Bonus equal to zero, plus (vi) accelerated vesting of unvested restricted stock, plus (vii) if the Termination Date occurs, or notice (including any notice of nonrenewal) that will result in termination is given, on or before April 1, 2025, an amount equal to the Employee s average annual total compensation, including (but not limited to) the value of all salary, bonus, grants of restricted stock, perquisites and benefits, for the immediately preceding five (5) years. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 9(a)(vii) shall not apply if the Termination Date is after April 1, 2025, plus (viii) continued coverage under all group benefit plans (e.g., medical, dental and vision) for a period of eighteen months following the Termination Date, or if during a Change in Control Extension, for a period of twenty-four months following the Termination Date, in each case at the same cost to Employee as prior to the Termination Date. If Employer is unable to provide this continuing coverage, Employer shall pay for or reimburse Employee for the cost of obtaining any missing coverage. (b) Payment. All cash components of the above-described severance payments shall be paid in a lump sum within thirty (30) days of the Termination Date; provided that, only to the extent required by Section 409A of the Code (defined below), such payments shall be made in a lump sum six months after the Termination Date. 8 (c) Limitation on Payments. If any payment or benefit Employee would receive from Employer or otherwise Payment would (i) constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), and (ii) but for this sentence, be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the Excise Tax ), then such Payment shall be reduced to the Reduced Amount. The Reduced Amount shall be either (x) the largest portion of the Payment that would result in no portion of the Payment being subject to the Excise Tax or (y) the largest portion, up to and including the total, of the Payment, whichever amount, after taking into account all applicable federal, state and local employment taxes, income taxes, and the Excise Tax (all computed at the highest applicable marginal rate), results in Employee s receipt, on an after-tax basis, of the greater amount of the Payment notwithstanding that all or some portion of the Payment may be subject to the Excise Tax. If a reduction in payments or benefits constituting parachute payments is necessary so that the Payment equals the Reduced Amount, reduction shall occur in the following order unless Employee elects in writing a different order (provided, however, that such election shall be subject to Employer approval if made on or after the date on which the event that triggers the Payment occurs): reduction of cash payments; cancellation of accelerated vesting of stock awards; and reduction of employee benefits. In the event that acceleration of vesting of stock award compensation is to be reduced, such acceleration of vesting shall be cancelled in the reverse order of the date of grant of Employee s stock awards unless Employee elects in writing a different order for cancellation. The accounting firm engaged by Employer for general audit purposes as of the day prior to the effective date of the event that triggers the Payment shall perform the foregoing calculations. If the accounting firm so engaged by Employer is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity or group effecting the change in ownership as described in Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code, Employer shall appoint a nationally recognized accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder. Employer shall bear all expenses with respect to the determinations by such accounting firm required to be made hereunder. The accounting firm engaged to make the determinations hereunder shall provide its calculations, together with detailed supporting documentation, to Employer and Employee within fifteen (15) calendar days after the date on which Employee s right to a Payment is triggered (if requested at that time by Employer or Employee) or such other time as requested by Employer or Employee. If the accounting firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable with respect to a Payment, either before or after the application of the Reduced Amount, it shall furnish Employer and Employee with an opinion reasonably acceptable to Employee that no Excise Tax will be imposed with respect to such Payment. Any good faith determinations of the accounting firm made hereunder shall be final, binding and conclusive upon Employer and Employee. 10. Benefits Upon Termination. Except as otherwise expressly provided by this Agreement and without limiting any rights granted to Employee hereunder, all insurance benefits provided under Section 5 of this Agreement shall be extended, at Employee's election and cost, to the extent permitted by Employer's insurance policies and benefit plans, for one year after Employee's Termination Date, except (a) as required by law (e.g., COBRA health insurance continuation election) or (b) in the event of a termination described in Section 7(a) or 8(a). 

9 11. Death/Disability. (a) In the event (during the Employment Term) of Employee's death, (i) this Agreement shall terminate, (ii) Employer shall pay to Employee's estate or heirs any unpaid base salary and any annual incentive compensation to which Employee may be entitled as of the Termination Date, and (iii) Employee's estate and heirs shall not be entitled to any severance payments hereunder. In addition, the restricted stock or stock options scheduled to vest following the date of Employee's death shall receive accelerated vesting and shall become exercisable upon Employee's death. Employee's estate shall have the right to receive or exercise such grants or options for the shorter of (i) two (2) years from the date of death, and (ii) the term of the grant or option. (b) In the event (during the Employment Term) of Employee's long term disability (as defined in Employee's Group Disability Plan) and the passing of the Elimination Period (as defined in Employee's Group Disability Plan), (i) this Agreement shall terminate, (ii) Employer shall pay to Employee any unpaid base salary and any annual incentive compensation to which Employee is entitled as of the Termination Date, and (iii) Employee shall not be entitled to any severance payments hereunder. In addition, the restricted stock or stock options scheduled to vest after the date of Employee's disability shall receive accelerated vesting and shall become exercisable upon the termination of this Agreement due to Employee's disability. Employee shall have the right to receive or exercise such grants or options for the shorter of (i) two (2) years from the date of disability, and (ii) the term of the grant or option. 12. Maintenance of Confidentiality and Duty of Loyalty. (a) General. Employee acknowledges that, pursuant to his employment with Employer, he will necessarily have access to trade secrets and information that is confidential and proprietary to Employer in connection with the performance of his duties. In consideration for the disclosure to Employee of, and the grant to Employee of access to such valuable and confidential information and in consideration of his employment, Employee shall comply in all respects with the provisions of this Section 12. (b) Nondisclosure. During the Employment Term and for a period of three (3) years thereafter, Confidential and Proprietary Information of Employer of which Employee gains knowledge during the Employment Term shall be used by Employee only for the benefit of Employer in connection with Employee's performance of his employment duties, and Employee shall not, and shall not allow any other person that gains access to such information in any manner to, without the prior written consent of Employer, disclose, communicate, divulge or otherwise make available, or use, any such information, other than for the immediate benefit of Employer. For purposes of this Agreement, the term Confidential and Proprietary Information means information not generally known to the public and which is proprietary to Employer and relates to Employer's existing or reasonably foreseeable business or operations, including but not limited to trade secrets, business plans, advertising or public relations strategies, financial information, budgets, personnel information, customer information and lists, and information pertaining to research, development, manufacturing, engineering, processing, product designs (whether or not patented or patentable), purchasing and licensing, and which may be embodied in reports or other writings or in blue prints or in other tangible forms such as 10 equipment and models. Employee will refrain from any acts or omissions that would jeopardize the confidentiality or reduce the value of any Employer Confidential and Proprietary Information. (c) Covenant of Loyalty. During the Employment Term, Employee shall not, on his own account or as an employee, agent, promoter, consultant, partner, officer, director, or as a more than 1 shareholder of any other person, firm, entity, partnership or corporation, own, operate, lease, franchise, conduct, engage in, be connected with, have any interest in, or assist any person or entity engaged in any business in the continental United States that is in any way competitive with or similar to the business that is conducted by Employer or is in the same general field or industry as Employer. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Employee does hereby covenant that he will not, during the Employment Term: (i) solicit, accept or receive any compensation from any customer of Employer or any business competitive to that of Employer; or (ii) contact, solicit or call upon any customer or supplier of Employer on behalf of any person or entity other than Employer for the purpose of selling, providing or performing any services of the type normally provided or performed by Employer; or (iii) induce or attempt to induce any person or entity to curtail or cancel any business or contracts which such person or entity has with Employer; or (iv) induce or attempt to induce any person or entity to terminate, cancel or breach any contract which such person or entity has with Employer, or receive or accept any benefits from such termination, cancellation or breach. (d) No Solicitation. During the Employment Term and for a period of three (3) years thereafter, Employee agrees not to interfere with the business of Employer or any Affiliate of Employer by directly or indirectly soliciting, attempting to solicit, inducing or otherwise causing any employee of Employer or any Affiliate of Employer to terminate his or her employment with Employer in order to become an employee, consultant or independent contractor to or for any other person or entity. (e) Injunctive Relief. Employee expressly agrees that the covenants set forth in this Section 12 are reasonable and necessary to protect Employer and its legitimate business interests, and to prevent the unauthorized dissemination of Confidential and Proprietary Information to competitors of Employer. Employee also agrees that Employer will be irreparably harmed and that damages alone cannot adequately compensate Employer if there is a violation of this Section 12 by Employee, and that injunctive relief against Employee is essential for the protection of Employer. Therefore, in the event of any such breach, it is agreed that, in addition to any other remedies available, Employer shall be entitled as a matter of right to injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction, plus attorneys' fees actually incurred in seeking such relief. Furthermore, Employee agrees that Employer shall not be required to post a bond or other collateral security with the court if Employer seeks injunctive relief. To the extent any provision of this Section 12 is deemed unenforceable by virtue of its scope or limitation, 11 Employee and Employer agree that the scope and limitation provisions shall nevertheless be enforceable to the fullest extent permissible under the laws and public policies applied in such jurisdiction where enforcement is sought. 13. Affiliate. Affiliate means a person that, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the first mentioned person. 14. Notices. Any notice which either party may wish or be required to give to the other party pursuant to this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be either personally served or deposited in the United States mail, registered or certified, and with proper postage prepaid. Mailed notices to Employee shall be addressed to Employee at the home address which Employee most recently communicated to Employer in writing. In the case of Employer, mailed notices shall be addressed to its corporate headquarters, and all notices shall be directed to the attention of the Executive Chairman or the CEO. Notice given by personal service shall be deemed effective upon service. Notice given by registered or certified mail shall be deemed effective three (3) days after deposit in the mail. 15. Binding Effect. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, their respective legal representatives, and their successors and assigns. As used in this Agreement, the term successor shall include any person, firm, corporation or other business entity which at any time, whether by merger, purchase, consolidation, or otherwise, acquired all or substantially all of the assets or business of Employer. This Agreement shall be deemed to be willfully breached by Employer if any such successor does not absolutely and unconditionally assume all of Employer's obligations under this Agreement and agree expressly to perform the obligations in the same manner and to the same extent as Employer would be required to perform such obligations in the absence of the succession. Employee may not assign any of his duties hereunder and he may not assign any of his rights hereunder without the written consent of Employer, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. 16. Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains the entire agreement of the parties and supersedes and replaces all prior agreements and understandings between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any obligations of the Employer under the Prior Employment Agreement that have arisen but not been performed as of the Start Date shall remain in full force and effect. 17. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws (without reference to choice or conflict of laws) of the State of Florida. 18. Arbitration. Employer and Employee agree that, to the extent permitted by law and to the extent that the enforceability of this Agreement is not thereby impaired, any and all disputes, controversies or claims between Employee and Employer, except disputes concerning the use or disclosure of trade secrets, proprietary and/or confidential information, or otherwise arising under Section 12 hereof, shall be determined exclusively by final and binding arbitration in the County of Palm Beach, Florida, in accordance with the employment rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. The controversy or claim shall be submitted to three 12 arbitrators, one of whom shall be chosen by Employer, one of whom shall be chosen by Employee, and the third of whom shall be chosen by the two arbitrators so selected. The party desiring arbitration shall give written notice to the other party of its desire to arbitrate the particular matter in question, naming the arbitrator selected by it. If the other party shall fail within a period of 15 days after such notice shall have been given to reply in writing naming the arbitrator selected by it, then the party not in default may apply to the American Arbitration Association for the appointment of the second arbitrator. If the two arbitrators chosen as above shall fail within 15 days after their selection to agree upon a third arbitrator, then either party may apply to the American Arbitration Association for the appointment of an arbitrator to fill the place so remaining vacant. Employer shall pay the fees of the arbitrators so selected. The decision of any two of the arbitrators shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto and shall be delivered in writing signed in triplicate by the concurring arbitrators to each of the parties hereto. The parties agree that both parties will be allowed to engage in adequate discovery consistent with the nature of the claims in dispute. The arbitrators shall have the authority to entertain a motion to dismiss and/or a motion for summary judgment by any party and shall apply the standards governing such motions under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The arbitrators shall have discretion to award monetary and other damages, or no damages, and to fashion such other relief as the arbitrators deem appropriate. The arbitrators also shall have discretion to award the prevailing party reasonable costs and attorneys' fees incurred in bringing or defending an action under this Section 18, as permitted by applicable law. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section 18 shall limit the Employer's ability to seek injunctive relief for any violation of Employee's obligations concerning nondisclosure, loyalty and nonsolicitation as set forth in Section 12 hereof. Any such injunctive relief proceeding shall be without prejudice to any rights Employer or Employee may have under this Agreement to obtain relief in arbitration with respect to such matters. 19. Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision or any other jurisdiction, but this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions had never been contained herein. 20. Amendments and Waivers. This Agreement may be modified only by a written instrument duly executed by each party hereto. No breach of any covenant, agreement, warranty or representation shall be deemed waived unless expressly waived in writing by the party who might assert such breach. No waiver of any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver of any other right or of the same or a similar right on another occasion. 21. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by the parties in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument. 

13 22. Section Headings. The headings of each Section, subsection or other subdivision of this Agreement are for reference only and shall not limit or control the meaning thereof. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement to be effective as of the date first above written. Employer WILLIS LEASE FINANCE CORPORATION By: /s/ Austin C. Willis Austin C.
