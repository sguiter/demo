Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our
unaudited Condensed Financial Statements and related notes thereto included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q, and our audited financial statements and related notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 fiscal 2024 ). 

Overview 

Electromed,
Inc. we, our, us, Electromed or the Company develops and
provides innovative airway clearance products applying High Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation HFCWO technologies
in pulmonary care for patients. 

We
manufacture, market and sell products that provide HFCWO, including the SmartVest Airway Clearance System SmartVest
System that includes our newest generation SmartVest Clearway Airway Clearance System Clearway ), previous
generation SmartVest SQL , and related garments and accessories to patients with compromised pulmonary function. The SmartVest
Clearway, which received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in November 2022, provides patients with
proven quality of life outcomes while offering a state-of-the-art patient experience with a simple touch screen user interface,
small generator footprint and comfortable, lightweight vests. 

Our
products are sold in both the homecare market and the hospital market for inpatient use, which we refer to as hospital
sales. Since 2000, we have marketed the SmartVest System and its predecessor products to patients suffering from bronchiectasis,
cystic fibrosis, and other chronic pulmonary conditions which require external chest manipulation to enhance mucus transport.
Additionally, we offer our products to a patient population that includes neuromuscular disorders such as cerebral palsy, muscular
dystrophies, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS ), patients with post-surgical complications or who are ventilator
dependent and patients who have other conditions involving excess secretion and impaired mucus transport. 

The
SmartVest System is often eligible for reimbursement from major private insurance providers, health maintenance organizations HMOs ), state Medicaid systems, and the federal Medicare system, which we believe is an important consideration
for patients considering an HFCWO course of therapy. For domestic sales, the SmartVest System may be reimbursed under the Medicare-assigned
billing code (E0483) for HFCWO devices if the patient has cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis (including chronic bronchitis or COPD
that has resulted in a diagnosis of bronchiectasis), or any one of certain enumerated neuromuscular diseases and myopathies and
can demonstrate that another less expensive physical or mechanical treatment did not adequately mobilize retained secretions.
Private payers consider a variety of sources, including Medicare, as guidelines in setting their coverage policies and payment
amounts.

financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, of our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2024 .

Homecare
revenue . Homecare revenue increased by 2,058,000, or 18.5 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared
to the same period in fiscal 2024. The increase in revenue was due to an increase in referrals driven by an increase in direct
sales representatives, higher net revenues per approval, and efficiencies within our reimbursement department. 

Hospital
revenue. Hospital revenue increased by 183,000, or 36.1 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to
the same period in fiscal 2024. This increase was primarily due to an increase in capital and disposable demand. 

Homecare
distributor revenue . Homecare distributor revenue increased by 14,000 or 2.4 , for the three months ended September
30, 2024, compared to the same period in fiscal 2024. The change in Homecare distributor sales was primarily a result of the
timing of distributor purchases that can cause fluctuations in reported revenue on a quarterly basis. 

Other
revenue . Other revenue increased by 89,000, or 97.8 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the
same period in fiscal 2024. The increase in other revenue was primarily due to the timing of international distributor purchases and
purchases by customers that do not fall within the other markets described above, which can cause fluctuations in reported revenue
on a quarterly basis. 

Though we have not identified a material impact to our net revenues for the three months ended
September 30, 2024, we continue to monitor the potential impact of natural disasters such as hurricanes, which may have an impact on
providers and their patients getting access to our product. 

Gross
profit 

Gross
profit increased to 11,491,000, or 78.3 of net revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 9,498,000, or
77.1 of net revenues, in the same period in fiscal 2024. The increase in gross profit dollars for the three months ended September
30, 2024, was primarily due to increased revenue volume and a higher average net revenue per device. The gross margin rate increased
year over year driven by a higher average net revenue per device. 

Operating
expenses 

Selling,
general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses were 9,387,000
for the three months ended September 30, 2024, representing an increase of 237,000 or 2.6 , compared to the same period in the
prior year. 

SG A
payroll and compensation-related expenses including health insurance benefits and other compensation increased by 691,000, or
12.0 , to 6,457,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase
in the current period was primarily due to increases in share-based compensation associated with the vesting of performance-based
equity awards, salaries, and incentive compensation related to the higher average number of sales, sales support, marketing, and
reimbursement personnel to process higher patient referrals. We have also continued to provide regular merit-based increases for
our employees and are regularly benchmarking our compensation ranges including share-based compensation for new and existing employees
to ensure we can hire and retain the talent needed to drive growth in our business. Field sales employees totaled 60 as of September
30, 2024, 53 of which were direct sales representatives, compared to 59 field sales employees and 51 direct sales representatives
as of September 30, 2023. 

12 

Travel,
meals and entertainment expenses increased 47,000, or 5.1 , to 964,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared
to the same period in the prior year. The increase in the current year was primarily due to a higher average number of direct
sales representatives and higher travel costs. 

Total
discretionary marketing expenses decreased 263,000, or 49.9 , to 264,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared
to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due a one-time investment in market research in the prior year
that did not recur in the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Professional
fees decreased 171,000, or 13.0 , to 1,140,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in
the prior year. Professional fees are primarily for services related to legal costs, shareowner services and reporting requirements,
information technology technical support and consulting fees. The decrease was primarily due to clinical fees in the prior year
related to the finalization of a clinical study that did not recur in the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Research
and development expenses. Research and development R D expenses decreased 40,000, or 19.4 , to 166,000
for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to
reduced costs associated with our SmartVest Clearway platform development in the prior year which has now been launched into the
Homecare and Hospital markets. 

Operating
income 

Operating
income increased by 1,796,000, to 1,938,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the
prior year. The increase is primarily due to an increase in revenue and gross profit and growth in selling, general and administrative
expense growth tracking below revenue growth. 

Interest
income, net 

Net
interest income increased 118,000, to 195,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in
the prior year. The increase is due to increased savings rates on higher cash balances. 

Income
tax expense 

Income
tax expense was estimated at 659,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to an estimated income tax expense
of 64,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rates were 30.9 and 29.3 for the three months ended
September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, included a discrete
tax benefit of 4,000 primarily related to the vesting of restricted stock awards. 

Net
income 

Net
income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 1,474,000 compared to 155,000 for the same period in the prior year.
The increase in net income was primarily due to increased revenue and gross profit.

the three months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 2,309,000. Cash flows provided by operating
activities consisted of net income of 1,474,000, non-cash expenses of 917,000, a decrease in accounts receivable of 967,000,
a decrease in inventory of 278,000, and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 806,000. These cash flows
from operating activities were offset by a decrease in accrued compensation of 1,743,000, an increase in prepaid expenses and
other assets of 266,000, a decrease in income tax payable of 89,000, and an increase in contract assets of 35,000. The decrease
in accrued compensation was primarily due to the payment of previously accrued annual incentives.

Cash
Flows from Investing Activities 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in investing activities was 58,000. Cash used in investing activities consisted
of 37,000 of expenditures for property and equipment and 21,000 in expenditures for intangible asset costs. 

Cash
Flows from Financing Activities 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, cash used by financing activities was 4,467,000, consisting of 4,536,000 used to
repurchase common stock and 15,000 used to pay taxes for equity issued on a net basis. These amounts were partially offset by
cash received from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of options of 84,000. 

Adequacy
of Capital Resources 

Our
primary working capital requirements relate to adding employees to our sales force and support functions, continuing infrastructure
investments, and supporting general corporate needs, including financing equipment purchases and other capital expenditures incurred
in the ordinary course of business. Based on our current operational performance, we believe our working capital of approximately
 33,591,000 and available borrowings under our existing credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our anticipated
working capital and other liquidity needs for the next twelve months from the date of this report. 

We
maintain a credit facility that was last amended in December 2023, which provides us with a revolving line of credit. Interest
on borrowings on the line of credit accrues at the prime rate (8.0 as of September 30, 2024) less 1.0 and is payable monthly.
There was no outstanding principal balance on the line of credit as of September 30, 2024, or June 30, 2024. The amount eligible
for borrowing on the line of credit is limited to the lesser of 2,500,000 or 57.0 of eligible accounts receivable, and the line
of credit expires on December 18, 2025, if not renewed. As of September 30, 2024, the maximum 2,500,000 was available under the
line of credit. Payment obligations under the line of credit are secured by a security interest in substantially all our tangible
and intangible assets. 

The
documents governing our line of credit contain certain financial and nonfinancial covenants that include a minimum tangible net
worth of not less than 10,125,000 and restrictions on our ability to incur certain additional indebtedness or pay dividends. 

Any
failure to comply with these covenants in the future may result in an event of default, which if not cured or waived, could result
in the lender accelerating the maturity of our indebtedness, preventing access to additional funds under the line of credit, requiring
prepayment of outstanding indebtedness, or refusing to renew the line of credit. If the maturity of the indebtedness is accelerated
or the line of credit is not renewed, sufficient cash resources to satisfy the debt obligations may not be available and we may
not be able to continue operations as planned. If we are unable to repay such indebtedness, the lender could foreclose on these
assets. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, we spent approximately 37,000 and 109,000, respectively, on property and
equipment. We currently expect to finance planned equipment purchases with cash flows from operations. We may need to incur additional
debt if we have an unforeseen need for additional capital equipment or if our operating performance does not generate adequate
cash flows. 

While
the impact of macroeconomic factors such as inflation are difficult to predict, we believe our cash, cash equivalents and cash
flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure, operational cash requirements for
fiscal 2025 and the foreseeable future. We will continue to evaluate our projected expenditures relative to our available
cash and evaluate financing alternatives to satisfy our working capital and other cash requirements.

that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected by such statements. Such statements involve known and
unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results or our industry s actual results, levels
of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from the information expressed or implied by the forward-looking

This
list of factors is not exhaustive, however, and these or other factors, many of which are outside of our control, could have a
material adverse effect on us and our results of operations. Therefore, you should consider these risk factors with caution and
form your own critical and independent conclusions about the likely effect of these risk factors on our future performance. Forward-looking
statements speak only as of the date on which the statements are made, and we undertake no obligation, and expressly disclaim
any such obligation, to update any forward-looking statement for any reason other than as required by law, even if new information
becomes available or other events occur in the future. You should carefully review the disclosures, and any risk factors described

 Option held by any such transferee will continue to be subject to the same terms and
 conditions that were applicable to the Option immediately prior to its transfer and may

 and has not terminated in accordance with the provisions of the Plan and this Agreement. 

Exhibit 10.1

 of Restricted Stock . 

(a) Scheduled
 Vesting . So long as you remain in Continuous Service, a portion of this Restricted
 Stock Award will cease to be subject to possible forfeiture on each Vesting Date specified
 in the table at the beginning of this Agreement, or at such earlier time as may be specified
 in subsection (b) of this Section 4. 

(b) Accelerated
 Vesting . Notwithstanding Section 4(a), the vesting of the Restricted Stock may be
 accelerated under the circumstances described in Sections 12(b) and 12(c) of the Plan,
 and at the discretion of the Committee in accordance with Section 3(b)(2) of the Plan. 

5. Release
 of Vested Stock . Following the vesting of Restricted Stock and the corresponding
 lapse of the transfer restrictions as to vested Stock, and after the Company has determined
 that all conditions to the release of vested Stock to you, including compliance with
 all applicable legal requirements, have been satisfied, it shall release to you such
 vested Stock, as evidenced by issuance to you of a stock certificate without restrictive
 legend, by electronic delivery of such Stock to a brokerage account designated by you,
 or by an unrestricted book-entry registration of such Stock with the Company s
 transfer agent. 

6. Forfeiture
 of Restricted Stock . Subject to Section 4(b), if your Continuous Service terminates
 before all of Restricted Stock has vested, or if you attempt to transfer Restricted Stock
 in a manner contrary to the transfer restrictions, you will immediately forfeit all unvested
 Restricted Stock. Any Restricted Stock that is forfeited shall be returned to the Company
 for cancellation. 

7. Withholding
 Taxes . You hereby authorize the Company (or any Affiliate) to withhold from payroll
 or other amounts payable to you any sums required to satisfy any federal, state, local
 or foreign withholding taxes that may be due as a result of the receipt or vesting of
 Restricted Stock, and the Company may defer the release to you of any and all unrestricted
 Shares until you have made arrangements acceptable to the Company for payment of all
 such withholding taxes in accordance with the provisions of Section 14 of the Plan. You
 may satisfy such withholding tax obligations by having the Company withhold a number
 of Shares that would otherwise be issued to you in settlement of this Restricted Stock
 Award and that have a Fair Market Value equal to the amount of such withholding tax obligations.
 Unless you notify the Company otherwise at least 30 days in advance of any Vesting Date,
 the Company will be entitled to assume you are satisfying your tax withholding obligations
 as provided in the previous sentence. You further acknowledge that the Company has directed
 you to seek independent advice regarding the applicable provisions of the Code, the income
 tax laws of any municipality, state or foreign country in which you may reside. 

8. Restrictive
 Legends and Stop-Transfer Orders . 

(a) Legends .
 Any certificate or certificates representing the Restricted Stock will bear the following
 legend (as well as any legends required by applicable state and federal corporate and
 securities laws) noting the existence of the restrictions set forth in this Agreement: 

THE
SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY BE TRANSFERRED ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF A RESTRICTED STOCK AGREEMENT BETWEEN
THE COMPANY AND THE PARTICIPANT, A COPY OF WHICH IS ON FILE WITH THE SECRETARY OF THE COMPANY. 

(b) Stop-Transfer
 Notices . You agree that, in order to ensure compliance with the restrictions referred
 to herein, the Company may issue appropriate stop transfer instructions
 to its transfer agent, if any, and that, if the Company transfers its own securities,
 it may make appropriate notations to the same effect in its own records. 

(c) Refusal
 to Transfer . The Company will not be required (i) to transfer on its books any Shares
 subject to this Agreement that have been sold or otherwise transferred in violation of
 any of the provisions of this Agreement or (ii) to treat as owner of such Shares or to
 accord the right to vote or pay dividends to any purchaser or other transferee to whom
 such Shares will have been so transferred. 

9. No
 Right to Continued Service or Future Awards . This Agreement awards Restricted
 Stock to you, but does not impose any obligation on the Company to make any future grants
 or issue any future Awards to you or otherwise continue your participation under the
 Plan. This Agreement will not give you a right to continued Service with the Company
 or any Affiliate, and the Company may terminate your Service and otherwise deal with
 you without regard to the effect it may have upon you under this Agreement. 

10. Tax
 Consequences . 

(a) You
 understand that unless a proper and timely election under Section 83(b) of the Code has
 been made, at the time the Restricted Stock vests, you will be obligated to recognize
 ordinary income and be taxed in an amount equal to the Fair Market Value as of the date
 of vesting of the applicable number of Shares. You shall be solely responsible for any
 tax obligations that may arise as a result of this Restricted Stock Award. 

(b) You
 understand that you may choose to file, within thirty (30) days of the Grant Date, an
 election with the Internal Revenue Service electing pursuant to Section 83(b) to be taxed
 on the Fair Market Value of the Restricted Stock on the Grant Date. You acknowledge that
 it is your sole responsibility to timely file such an election, and that if such an election
 is made, you shall promptly provide the Company a copy of such election. If you make
 and file such an election, you shall make such arrangements in accordance with Section
 7 of this Agreement as are satisfactory to the Committee to provide for the timely payment
 of all applicable withholding taxes. 

11. Compliance
 with Applicable Legal Requirements . No vested Shares deliverable pursuant to
 this Agreement shall be delivered unless such delivery complies with all applicable legal
 requirements, including compliance with the provisions of applicable state securities
 laws, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
 amended, and the requirements of the exchange(s) on which the Company s common
 stock may, at the time, be listed. 

12. Interpretation

 Committee with regard to any question arising hereunder or under the Plan will be binding
 and conclusive upon the Company and you. If there is any inconsistency between the provisions
 of this Agreement and the Plan, the provisions of the Plan will govern.

 and will be construed and interpreted thereunder (without regard to its conflict-of-law
 principles).

18. Compensation
 Recovery Policy . This Agreement and Restricted Stock Award and any compensation
 associated herewith is subject to forfeiture, recovery by the Company, or other action
 pursuant to any compensation recovery policy adopted by the Board or the Committee at
 any time, as amended from time to time, which includes but is not limited to any compensation
