FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, in particular Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). When used in this report, the words or phrases will likely result, expect, intend, will continue, anticipate, estimate, project, believe and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Exchange Act. These statements represent our expectations or beliefs concerning, among other things, future revenue, earnings, growth strategies, new products and initiatives, future operations and operating results, and future business and market opportunities. 
 
 Forward-looking statements in this report speak only as of the date hereof, and forward-looking statements in documents incorporated by reference speak only as of the date of those documents. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. We caution and advise readers that these statements are based on certain assumptions that may not be realized and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations and beliefs contained herein. 
 
 For a summary of certain risks related to our business, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, which includes the following: 

Because our Hong Kong operations account for a substantial portion of our overall business, and substantially all of our Hong Kong business is derived from the sale of products to members in China, any material adverse change in our business relating to either Hong Kong or China would likely have a material adverse impact on our overall business; 

Our Hong Kong operations are being adversely affected by recent political and social developments in Hong Kong, and the negative impact on our operations and financial performance could continue or intensify; 

We experienced negative operating cash flows during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, and only modest positive operating cash flows during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Unless our operating cash flows improve, this negative financial performance could have a material adverse effect on our business and our stock price; 

Adverse publicity associated with our products, ingredients or network marketing program, or those of similar companies, could harm our financial condition and operating results; 

Our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment; 

We are subject to risks relating to product concentration and lack of revenue diversification; 

Epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or natural disasters, terrorist attacks or acts of war or hostility may seriously harm our business; 

The high level of competition in our industry could adversely affect our business; 

Failure of new products to gain member and market acceptance could harm our business; 

We rely on a limited number of independent third parties to manufacture and supply our products on a timely basis; 

Growth may be impeded by the political and economic risks of entering and operating in foreign markets; 

Failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could negatively impact our business and the market price of our common stock; 

We could be adversely affected by management changes or an inability to attract and retain key management, directors and consultants; 

Our recent loss of a significant number of members is adversely affecting our business, and if we cannot stabilize or increase the number of members our business could be further negatively impacted; 

Although virtually all of our members are independent contractors, improper member actions that violate laws or regulations could harm our business; 

An increase in the amount of compensation paid to members would reduce profitability; 

We may be held responsible for certain taxes or assessments relating to the activities of our members and service providers, which could harm our financial condition and operating results; 

Our business in China is subject to compliance with a myriad of applicable laws and regulations, and any actual or alleged violations of those laws or government actions otherwise directed at us could have a material adverse impact on our business and the value of our company; 

Changes in government trade and economic policies, including the imposition or threatened imposition of tariffs and other restrictive trade policies, and ongoing political and economic disputes between the United States and other jurisdictions, particularly China, may have a negative effect on global economic conditions and our business, financial results and financial condition; 

Direct-selling laws and regulations may prohibit or severely restrict our direct sales efforts and cause our revenue and profitability to decline, and regulators could adopt new regulations that harm our business; 

Our business is subject to a variety of laws, regulations and other obligations regarding privacy, data protection and information security. Any actual or perceived failure by us or our third-party vendors to comply with such laws, regulations or other obligations could materially adversely affect our business; 

Challenges by third parties to the legality of our business operations could harm our business; 

We have in the past been involved in, and may in the future face, lawsuits, claims, and governmental proceedings and inquiries that could harm our business; 

Currency exchange rate fluctuations could lower our revenue and net income; 

Changes in tax or duty laws, and unanticipated tax or duty liabilities, could adversely affect our net income; 

Transfer pricing regulations affect our business and results of operations; 

Our products and related activities are subject to extensive government regulation, which could delay, limit or prevent the sale of some of our products in some markets; 

New regulations governing the marketing and sale of nutritional supplements could harm our business; 

Regulations governing the production and marketing of our personal care products could harm our business; 

If we are found not to be in compliance with good manufacturing practices our operations could be harmed; 

Failure to comply with domestic and foreign laws and regulations governing product claims and advertising could harm our business; 

We are subject to anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; 

We do not have a comprehensive product liability insurance program and product liability claims could hurt our business; 

Table of Contents 

We may be unable to protect or use our intellectual property rights; 

We rely on and are subject to risks associated with our reliance upon information technology systems; 

System disruptions or failures, cybersecurity risks, and compromises of data, or the failure to comply with related laws and regulations, could harm our business; 

Our systems, software and data reside on third-party servers, exposing us to risks that disruption or intrusion of those servers could temporarily or permanently interrupt our access and damage our business; 

Our common stock is particularly subject to volatility because of the industry and markets in which we operate; and 

Our common stock continues to experience wide fluctuations in trading volumes and prices. This may make it more difficult for holders of our common stock to sell shares when they want and at prices they find attractive. 

Additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements are set forth in this report, including under the headings Risk Factors and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and in our financial statements and the related notes.

As of September 30, 2024 , cash and cash equivalents included million held in bank accounts located in China subject to foreign currency controls.

days to one year, and their historical return rates, which range from to of sales. Sales returns were of sales for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . No material changes in estimates have been recognized during the periods presented. See Note 3 for additional information. 
 
 The Company has elected to account for shipping and handling activities performed after title has passed to members as a fulfillment cost, and accrues for the costs of shipping and handling if revenue is recognized before the contractually obligated shipping and handling activities occurs. Shipping charges billed to members are included in net sales. Costs associated with shipments are included in cost of sales. Event and training revenue is deferred and recognized as the event or training occurs. Costs of events and member training are included within selling, general and administrative expenses. 
 
 Various taxes on the sale of products to members are collected by the Company as an agent and remitted to the respective taxing authority. These taxes are presented on a net basis and recorded as a liability until remitted to the respective taxing authority. 
 
 Deferred Revenue 
 
 The Company primarily receives payment by credit card at the time members place orders. Amounts received for unshipped product orders and unredeemed product vouchers are considered a contract liability and are recorded as deferred revenue. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company had million and million, respectively, of contract liabilities where performance obligations have not yet been satisfied. The increase in contract liabilities from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 is primarily due to million of cash received for unshipped product orders and unredeemed product vouchers during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 offset by million of revenue recognized during the period that was included in contract liabilities at December 31, 2023 . As of December 31, 2022 , the Company had contract liabilities totaling million of which million was recognized as revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The Company expects to satisfy its remaining performance obligations and recognize the revenue within the next twelve months. 
 
 Disaggregation of Revenue 
 
 The Company sells products to a member network that operates in a seamless manner from market to market, except for the Chinese market where it sells to consumers through an e-commerce retail platform and the Russia and Kazakhstan market where the Company operates through an engagement of a third -party service provider. See Note 11 for revenue by market information. 

The Company s net sales by product and service are as follows (in thousands): 

Administrative fees, freight and other 
 Less: sales returns 
 Total net sales 

Concentration 
 
 No single market other than Hong Kong had net sales greater than 10 of total net sales. Sales are made to the Company s members and no single customer accounted for 10 or more of net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . However, the Company s business model can result in a concentration of sales to several different members and their network of members. Although no single member accounted for 10 or more of net sales, the loss of a key member or that member s network could have an adverse effect on the Company s net sales and financial results. 
 
 Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations 
 
 The Company s contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, the Company allocates revenues to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. The Company generally determines standalone selling prices based on the prices charged for individual products to similar customers. 
 
 Practical Expedients 
 
 The Company generally expenses sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded in commissions expense. 
 
 The Company does not provide certain disclosures about unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less.

square feet of corporate office space in Hong Kong with a term expiring in June 2026, and square feet of corporate office space in Rolling Hills Estates, California with a term expiring in September 2030. To help further develop the market for its products in North America, the Company leases square feet of retail space in each of Rowland Heights, California and Richmond, British Columbia, and square feet of retail space in Metuchen, New Jersey. The Rowland Heights, Richmond and Metuchen locations have terms expiring in November 2025, February 2027, and December 2028, respectively. 
 
 The Company leases seven branch offices throughout China, and additional office space in Peru, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, India, and the Cayman Islands. The Company contracts with third parties for fulfillment and distribution operations in all of its international markets. None of the Company s third -party logistics contracts contain a lease, as the Company does not have the right to access the warehouses or move its inventories at will. 
 
 The components of lease cost were as follows (in thousands): 

Short-term leases 
 Total lease cost 

Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating leases liabilities was and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. 
 
 The weighted-average remaining lease term and discount rate related to operating leases as of September 30, 2024 were as follows: 

Weighted-average discount rate 

As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company used its incremental borrowing rate, or the rate of each of its subsidiaries if available, based on the information available at the lease commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments. 
 
 The annual scheduled lease payments of the Company's operating lease liabilities as of September 30, 2024 were as follows (in thousands):

 Less: imputed interest 
 Present value of lease liabilities 

For all asset classes, the Company elected not to recognize assets or liabilities at the acquisition date for leases that, at the acquisition date, have a remaining lease term of 12 months or less. Additionally, for all asset classes, the Company choose not to separate nonlease components from lease components and instead account for the combined lease and nonlease components associated with that lease component as a single lease component. 

that begin expiring in 2038. At September 30, 2024 , the Company has foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million in various jurisdictions with various expirations. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 , income taxes payable for the repatriation tax on the deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income required by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act ), enacted in 2017 by the U.S. government, totaled million, which is payable in April 2025. 
 
 As a result of capital return activities, the Company determined that a portion of its current undistributed foreign earnings not deemed reinvested indefinitely by its non-U.S. subsidiaries. For state income tax purposes, the Company will continue to periodically reassess the needs of its foreign subsidiaries and update its indefinite reinvestment assertion as necessary. To the extent that additional foreign earnings are not deemed permanently reinvested, the Company expects to recognize additional income tax provision at the applicable state corporate income tax rate(s). As of September 30, 2024 , the Company has not recorded a state deferred tax liability for earnings that the Company plans to repatriate out of accumulated earnings in future periods because all earnings as of September 30, 2024 have already been repatriated. Due to the Tax Act, repatriation from foreign subsidiaries will be offset with a dividends received deduction, resulting in little to no impact on federal tax expense. All undistributed earnings in excess of 50 of current earnings on an annual basis are intended to be reinvested indefinitely as of September 30, 2024 . 
 
 The Company and its subsidiaries file tax returns in the United States, California, New Jersey, Texas and various foreign jurisdictions. The Company is no longer subject to state income tax examinations for years prior to 2018. The Company is not aware of any jurisdiction that is currently examining any of its income tax returns.

Under the terms of the Phantom Plan, the Board of Directors' Compensation Committee may grant to the Company s employees, officers, directors, contractors, consultants, or advisors awards of phantom shares entitling grantees the right to receive a cash payment equal to the fair market value of an equal number of shares of the Company s common stock upon the close of a vesting period, subject to any maximum payment value that the Compensation Committee may set. The vesting of phantom shares is subject to such vesting conditions as the Compensation Committee may specify in a grantee s award agreement. Grantees of phantom shares shall not by virtue of their receipt of phantom shares have any ownership rights in shares of the Company s common stock. The Phantom Plan shall continue for a period of ten years, after which no further phantom shares may be awarded (although any phantom shares awarded prior to the expiration of such 10 -year period shall be unaffected by the termination of the Phantom Plan). 
 
 On February 7, 2023, the Company granted phantom shares to certain of the Company s employees and its non-employee directors. The phantom shares vest in eight equal three -month vesting increments, subject to the satisfaction of both a time-based vesting condition and a performance vesting condition. Both of these vesting conditions were deemed satisfied on the grant date for the initial vesting increment. In order for the time-based vesting condition to be satisfied for each vesting period, the grantee must remain continuously employed by, or be otherwise continuously providing services to, the Company through the end of the vesting period, and in order for the performance vesting condition to be satisfied for each performance period, the performance criteria designated by the Compensation Committee must be satisfied. The initial performance vesting condition will be designated by the Compensation Committee and will apply to all future performance periods, unless the Compensation Committee elects to change the performance vesting condition on a prospective basis. Future changes to the performance vesting condition must be made on or before the fifteenth day of any future performance period. If either vesting condition is not satisfied for a vesting date, then the phantom shares scheduled to vest on such date will be forfeited. These phantom shares are subject to a maximum payment value of per phantom share. Of the phantom shares awarded in 2023, phantom shares vested, remain unvested, and were forfeited as of September 30, 2024 . 

The phantom share awards are accounted for as liabilities in accordance with FASB ASC Topic

 Stock Compensation since they require cash settlement. The grant date of each vesting increment will be established when the Company and the grantees reach a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions of an award, which is the date upon which each performance vesting condition is communicated to the grantees. Compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period if it is probable that the performance vesting condition will be achieved. The fair value of the liability incurred is remeasured at the end of each reporting period with any changes in fair value recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period.

As a result of the vesting of phantom shares, the Company recognized compensation expense related to the cash settlement of such shares of and during the during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively.

 Stock Repurchases 
 
 In 2016, the Board of Directors authorized an increase to the Company s stock repurchase program first approved in 2015 from million to million. Any repurchases will be made in accordance with all applicable securities laws and regulations, including Rule 10b - 18 of the Exchange Act. For all or a portion of the authorized repurchase amount, the Company may enter into one or more plans that are compliant with Rule 10b5 - 1 of the Exchange Act that are designed to facilitate these purchases. The stock repurchase program does not require the Company to acquire a specific number of shares, and may be suspended from time to time or discontinued. As of September 30, 2024 , million of the million stock repurchase program remained available for future purchases, inclusive of related estimated income tax.

Item 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Business Overview 
 
 We are an international direct-selling and e-commerce company. Subsidiaries controlled by us sell personal care, wellness, and quality of life products under the NHT Global brand. Our wholly-owned subsidiaries have an active physical presence in the following markets: the Americas, which consists of the United States, Canada, Cayman Islands, Mexico and Peru; Greater China, which consists of Hong Kong, Taiwan and China; Southeast Asia, which consists of Malaysia , Singapore and Thailand; South Korea; Japan; India; and Europe. We also operate in Russia and Kazakhstan through our engagement with a local service provider. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were conducting business through 30,880 active members, compared to 32,410 at December 31, 2023 and 34,660 at September 30, 2023. We consider a member active if they have placed at least one product order with us during the preceding year. Our priority is to focus our resources in our most promising markets, which we consider to be Greater China and countries where our existing members have the connections to recruit prospects and sell our products, such as Southeast Asia, India, South America and Europe. 
 
 We generate approximately 93 of our net sales from subsidiaries located outside the Americas, with sales of our Hong Kong subsidiary representing 78 of net sales in the latest fiscal quarter. Because of the size of our foreign operations, operating results can be impacted negatively or positively by factors such as foreign currency fluctuations, inflation rates, and economic, political and business conditions around the world. In addition, our business is subject to various laws and regulations, in particular, regulations related to direct selling activities that create uncertain risks for our business, including improper claims or activities by our members and our potential inability to obtain necessary product registrations. We continually evaluate our business for compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and this process can and has resulted in the identification of certain matters of potential noncompliance, which we work to satisfactorily address. For further information regarding some of the risks associated with the conduct of our business in China and Hong Kong, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and more specifically under the captions Because our Hong Kong operations account for a substantial portion of our overall business... , Our Hong Kong operations are being adversely affected by recent political and social developments in Hong Kong... , and Our business in China is subject to compliance with a myriad of applicable laws and regulations... . 
 
 China has been and continues to be our most important business development project. We operate an e-commerce direct selling platform in Hong Kong that generates revenue derived from the sale of products to members in Hong Kong and elsewhere, including China. Substantially all of our Hong Kong revenues are derived from the sale of products that are delivered to members in China. Through a separate Chinese entity, we operate an e-commerce retail platform in China. We believe that neither of these activities require a direct selling license in China, which we do not currently hold. We previously submitted a preliminary application for a direct selling license in China, but in 2019 a Chinese governmental authority recommended that we withdraw our application. We expect to reapply for a direct selling license in China when we believe that circumstances are again ripe for doing so. If we are ultimately able to obtain a direct selling license in China, we believe that the incentives inherent in the direct selling model in China would incrementally benefit our existing business. We do not expect that any increased sales in China derived from obtaining a direct selling license would initially be material and, in any event may be partially offset by the higher fixed costs associated with the establishment and maintenance of required service centers, branch offices, manufacturing facilities, certification programs and other legal requirements. We are unable to predict whether and when we will be successful in obtaining a direct selling license to operate in China, and if we are successful, when we will be permitted to conduct direct selling operations and whether such operations would be profitable.

In January 2019 the Chinese government announced a 100-day campaign focused on companies involved in the sale of food, equipment, daily necessities, small home electrical appliances and services that are claimed to promote health. The Chinese government ministries in charge of this campaign indicated that they were targeting illegal practices in the industry, particularly the manufacture and sale of counterfeit and substandard products, and false advertising and misleading claims as to the health benefits of products and services. It is understood that the campaign was specifically focused on the business practices of direct selling companies. The campaign and associated negative media coverage resulted in a significant adverse impact on our business, as consumers widely curtailed their purchases within the affected industries. We, like some of our peers, voluntarily decided in January 2019 to temporarily suspend our member activities, such as product roadshows, product trainings and larger company-sponsored events, in China. We did this because we learned that the 100-day campaign was announced in broad outlines by the central government, and the interpretation and enforcement of the campaign was delegated to the provincial and local governments. We consider it a top priority for our business to develop an understanding of and cooperate with all levels and jurisdictions of the government agencies, and did not want to run the risk of being inadvertently entangled in government enforcement actions as the provincial and local governments formulate and implement their interpretive guidance and rule-making. Although we have been able to relax some restrictions on member activities in certain markets, it may again in the future be necessary or advisable to suspend member activities or take similar actions from time to time, and such periods of reduced activity may have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
 Although the 100-day campaign was due to expire in April 2019, we are not aware of any information indicating that the campaign has formally concluded. However, the Chinese government subsequently announced that it would conduct a look-back review to evaluate the 100-day campaign. As part of this review, we understand that various Chinese governmental agencies formed a working group to assess the 100-day campaign, particularly focusing on the health market and its supervision in certain provinces. We understand that during September 2019 the working group evaluated the performance and results of a number of organizations and governmental departments in these provinces and made recommendations for various improvements. It was noted that each province had opened a number of investigative cases, had successfully closed numerous cases, and had imposed various fines and penalties. We understand that the look-back review continued after September 2019, and we are not aware that this review has been completed. As a result, the business environment in China for health product companies continues to be challenging, which has been exacerbated by negative social media sentiment expressed for these types of companies. We believe that the campaign, as well as its extension and aftermath (including the look-back review), will continue to negatively impact our business in China in the near-term, but will ultimately benefit us and Chinese consumers in the long-term as purveyors of substandard products are driven from the market. 
 
 In late 2019 or early 2020 an outbreak of COVID-19 was first identified in China and subsequently spread around the world. On March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic. The outbreak caused the Chinese government to implement powerful measures to control the virus, such as requiring businesses to close throughout various areas of China and restricting public gatherings and certain travel within the country. We have significant business in China and in 2023 generated approximately 79 of our revenue in Hong Kong, substantially all of which was derived from the sale of products to members in China. Over the course of the pandemic, we took steps to adapt some of our marketing programs, such as relying on certain product promotions and webcast training, to overcome the physical restrictions imposed in response to the pandemic. In late 2022, the Chinese and Hong Kong governments took comprehensive steps to relax many of their COVID-19 control measures, although the cumulative effect of the disruptions associated with the pandemic materially negatively impacted our financial results from 2020 through 2022. This less restrictive business environment in China and Hong Kong continued throughout 2023 and the first nine months of 2024, and we have been able to sponsor in-person member events in China, Hong Kong and/or Macau during each quarter since the first quarter of 2023. We are continuing to plan and sponsor more such events consistent with normal operations. Nevertheless, it may be too early to accurately predict the impact on us and our third-party providers of this relaxation of control measures and whether it will prove enduring. Ultimately, the severity of the impact on us of the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the virus, and the related control measures, which we are unable to accurately predict. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or natural disasters, terrorist attacks or acts of war in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Recent political and social developments in Hong Kong, along with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related government control measures, are also adversely affecting our Hong Kong operations and led us in 2020 to cease sponsoring member meetings and events in Hong Kong. Inasmuch as member meetings and events located in Hong Kong have in the past served as an important component of our product marketing and distribution efforts, we believe that these developments negatively affected our past operations and financial performance. Although we have been able to sponsor in-person member events in Hong Kong in recent quarters, it may be too early to predict whether these developments will continue to adversely affect our overall business, results of operations and financial condition. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Our Hong Kong operations are being adversely affected by recent political and social developments in Hong Kong... in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Statement of Operations Presentation 
 
 We mainly derive revenue from sales of products. Substantially all of our product sales are to independent members at published wholesale prices. Product sales are recognized when the products are shipped and title passes to independent members, which generally is upon our delivery to the carrier that completes delivery to the members. We estimate and accrue a reserve for product returns based on our return policies and historical experience. We bill members for shipping charges and recognize the freight revenue in net sales. We have elected to account for shipping and handling activities performed after title has passed to members as a fulfillment cost, and accrue for the costs of shipping and handling if revenue is recognized before the contractually obligated shipping and handling activities occurs. Event and training revenue is deferred and recognized as the event or training occurs. 
 
 Cost of sales consists primarily of products purchased from third-party manufacturers, freight cost for transporting products to our foreign subsidiaries and shipping products to members, import duties, packing materials, product royalties, costs of promotional materials sold to our members at or near cost, and provisions for slow moving or obsolete inventories. Cost of sales also includes purchasing costs, receiving costs, inspection costs and warehousing costs. 
 
 Member commissions are our most significant expense and are classified as an operating expense. Under our compensation plan, members are paid weekly commissions by our subsidiary in which they are enrolled, generally in their home country currency, for product purchases by their down-line member network across all geographic markets. Our China subsidiary maintains an e-commerce retail platform and does not pay commissions, although our Chinese members may participate in our compensation plan through our other subsidiaries. This seamless compensation plan enables a member located in one country to enroll other members located in other countries where we are authorized to conduct our business. Currently, there are basically two ways in which our members can earn income: 

through commissions paid on the accumulated bonus volume from product purchases made by their down-line members and customers; and 

through retail profits on sales of products purchased by members at wholesale prices and resold at retail prices (for purchasers in some of our smaller markets and purchasers from our China subsidiary, sales are for personal consumption only and income may not be earned through retail profits). 

Each of our products is designated a specified number of bonus volume points. Commissions are based on total personal and group bonus volume points per weekly sales period. Bonus volume points are essentially a percentage of a product s wholesale price. As the member s business expands from successfully enrolling other members who in turn expand their own businesses by selling product to other members, the member receives higher commissions from purchases made by an expanding down-line network. In some of our markets, to be eligible to receive commissions, a member may be required to make nominal monthly or other periodic purchases of our products. Certain of our subsidiaries do not require these nominal purchases for a member to be eligible to receive commissions. In determining commissions, the number of levels of down-line members included within the member s commissionable group increases as the number of memberships directly below the member increases.

Table of Contents 

Under our current compensation plan, certain of our commission payouts may be limited to a hard cap dollar amount per week or a specific percentage of total product sales. In some markets, commissions may be further limited. In some markets, we also pay certain bonuses on purchases by up to three generations of personally sponsored members, as well as bonuses on commissions earned by up to seven generations of personally sponsored members. Members can also earn additional income, trips and other prizes in specific time-limited promotions and contests we hold from time to time. Member commissions are dependent on the sales mix and, for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, represented 41 and 42 of net sales, respectively. Occasionally, we make modifications and enhancements to our compensation plan to help motivate members, which can have an impact on member commissions. We may also enter into performance-based agreements for business or market development, which can result in additional compensation to specific members. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of administrative compensation and benefits, travel, credit card fees and assessments, professional fees, certain occupancy costs, and other corporate administrative expenses (including stock-based compensation). In addition, this category includes selling, marketing, and promotion expenses (including the costs of member training events and conventions that are designed to increase both product awareness and member recruitment). Because our various member conventions are not always held at the same time each year, interim period comparisons will be impacted accordingly. 
 
 The functional currency of our international subsidiaries is generally their local currency. Local currency assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange on the balance sheet date, and local currency revenues and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange during the period. Equity accounts are translated at historical rates. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded directly into stockholders equity. 
 
 Sales by our foreign subsidiaries are generally transacted in the respective local currencies and are translated into U.S. dollars using average rates of exchange for each monthly accounting period to which they relate. Most of our product purchases from third-party manufacturers are transacted in U.S. dollars. Consequently, our sales and net earnings are affected by changes in currency exchange rates, with sales and earnings generally increasing with a weakening U.S. dollar and decreasing with a strengthening U.S. dollar.

 2 Substantially all of our Hong Kong revenues are derived from the sale of products that are delivered to members in China. See Item 1A. Risk Factors in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Net sales were 10.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 10.6 million for the comparable period a year ago, an increase of 76,000, or 1 . Hong Kong net sales, substantially all of which were derived from the sale of products shipped to members residing in China, were almost the same for each of the three-month periods, decreasing 56,000, or less than 1 , over the comparable period a year ago. Outside of our Hong Kong business, net sales increased 132,000, or 6 , over the comparable three-month period a year ago, primarily due to the increased quarter-over-quarter net sales in our Chinese e-commerce retail business. 
 
 Net sales were 32.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 33.0 million for the comparable period a year ago, a decrease of 870,000, or 3 . Hong Kong net sales, substantially all of which were derived from the sale of products shipped to members residing in China, were almost the same for each of the nine-month periods, decreasing 393,000, or 1 , over the comparable period a year ago. Hong Kong net sales were also adversely affected by the recognition of lower administrative fees in the current-year period, as compared to the prior-year period last year, as increased activity within member electronic wallet (eWallet) accounts resulted in less fees assessed during the current-year period. Outside of our Hong Kong business, net sales decreased 477,000, or 7 , over the comparable nine -month period a year ago, primarily due to the decreased period-over-period net sales in our business in the Americas (which was somewhat offset by increased period-over-period net sales in our Chinese e-commerce retail business). As of September 30, 2024 , deferred revenue was 6.8 million, which consisted of 5.2 million pertaining to unshipped product orders and unredeemed product vouchers, as well as 1.6 million in auto ship advances. 
 
 Gross Profit 
 
 Gross profit was 74.1 of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 74.7 of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . Gross profit was 73.9 of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 74.6 of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The decline in gross profit margin for both the three and nine -month periods ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to higher costs related to our Premium Noni Juice product. 
 
 Commissions Expense 
 
 Commissions were 40.5 of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 41.1 of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Commissions were 40.5 of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compa red with 42.0 of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The decline in commissions as a percentage of net sales during both the three and nine -month periods ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to lower weekly commissions earned outside of our Hong Kong business . 
 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses were 3.9 million for each of the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Selling, general and administra tive expenses decreased to 11.6 million for the nine -month period ended September 30, 2024 , as compared to 12.2 million in the same period a year ago. The decrease for the nine -month period was primarily due to lower professional fees and insurance expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 were roughly the same as the comparable period in the prior year and were modestly lower for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 than the same period a year ago. 
 
 Other Income, Net 
 
 Other income was 441,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 585,000 in the same period a year ago. Other income was 1.5 million and 1.7 million for each of the nine - month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. The decrease for both the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to less interest income earned during each of the current year periods.

Income Taxes 
 
 An income tax provision of 131,000 and 121,000 were recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. An income tax provision of 249,000 and 69,000 were recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. The tax provision during each of the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 primarily resulted from foreign income inclusions, such as global intangible low-taxed income GILTI and Subpart F income, tax benefits in foreign jurisdictions and year-to-date consolidated income through September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 At September 30, 2024, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled 46.3 million. Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased by 9.9 million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 due to the dividends paid during the first nine months of 2024 and the payment of the repatriation tax on the deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income as required by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2024, we had 37.9 million in available-for-sale investments classified as either cash equivalents or marketable securities. In addition, cash and cash equivalents included 3.8 million held in banks located within China subject to foreign currency controls. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 , the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.6 to 1.0 and we had 32.7 million of working capital. Working capital as of September 30, 2024 decreased 11.5 million compared to our working capital as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 Cash used in operations was 3.5 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared with 4.2 million for the first nine mon ths of 2023 . Income tax paid during April 2024 and April 2023 for the repatriation tax on the deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income was 4.0 million and 3.0 million, respectively. Disregarding these payments, cash flows from operations im proved 1.7 million primarily due to improved management of inventories and operating costs during the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the same period last year, as well as a timing difference related to weekly commission outflows. 
 
 Cash flows used in investing activities totaled 23.1 million and 32,000 during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the first nine months of 2024, we purchased 44.8 million in marketable securities with original maturities greater than three months, and as such, reflect these purchases as an investing activity. These purchases of marketable securities were offset by 21.8 million of proceeds received from maturities of marketable securities. 
 
 Cash flows used in financing activities during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 consisted solely of quarterly dividend payments of 0.20 per common share, totaling 6.9 million in each period. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, on October 28, 2024, the Board of Directors declared another quarterly cash dividend of 0.20 on each share of common stock outstanding. The dividend will be payable on November 22, 2024 to stockholders of record on November 12, 2024. W e expect to continue paying a quarterly cash dividend of 0.20 on each share of common stock outstanding for the foreseeable future . However, any future cash dividends will be at the sole discretion of the Company s Board of Directors, and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and other factors considered relevant by the Board of Directors. 
 
 In 2016, the Board of Directors authorized an increase to the Company s stock repurchase program first approved in 2015 from 15.0 million to 70.0 million. Any repurchases will be made in accordance with all applicable securities laws and regulations, including Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. For all or a portion of the authorized repurchase amount, the Company may enter into one or more plans that are compliant with Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act that are designed to facilitate these purchases. The stock repurchase program does not require the Company to acquire a specific number of shares, and may be suspended from time to time or discontinued. As of September 30, 2024, 21.9 million of the 70.0 million stock repurchase program remained available for future purchases, inclusive of related estimated income tax. 
 
 We believe that our existing internal liquidity, supported by cash on hand and cash flows from operations, should be adequate to fund normal business operations and address our financial commitments for the foreseeable future. 
 
 We do not have any significant unused sources of liquid assets. If necessary, we may attempt to generate more funding from the capital markets, but currently we do not believe that will be necessary.

Our priority is to focus our resources on investing in our most important markets, which we consider to be Greater China and countries where our existing members may have the connections to recruit prospects and sell our products, such as Southeast Asia, India, South America and Europe. We will continue to invest in our Mainland China entity for such purposes as establishing China-based manufacturing capabilities, increasing public awareness of our brand and our products, sourcing more Chinese-made products, building a chain of service stations, opening additional Healthy Lifestyle Centers or branch offices, adding local staffing and other requirements for a prospective China direct selling license application. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which require our management to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations would be affected. We base our estimates on our own historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable after taking account of our circumstances and expectations for the future based on available information. We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. 
 
 We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (i) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (ii) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. There are items within our financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical, as defined above. 
 
 For a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies and related judgments, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on February 28, 2024. 

Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Not applicable under smaller reporting company disclosure rules. 
 
 Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Management, with the participation of the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of September 30, 2024. The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.
