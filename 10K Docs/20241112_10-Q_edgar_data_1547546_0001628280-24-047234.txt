loans, collateralized by multifamily properties, with unpaid principal balance of million on non-accrual status with interest collections accounted for on the cash basis method. See Note 3 for further discussion. 
 
 On January 1, 2023, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ("ASU 2016-13") and amendments, which replaces the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss model known as the Current Expected Credit Loss ("CECL") model. CECL amends the previous credit loss model to reflect a reporting entity's current estimate of all expected credit losses, not only based on historical experience and current economic conditions, but also by including reasonable and supportable forecasts incorporating forward-looking information. The measurement of expected credit losses under CECL is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost, and off-balance credit exposures such as unfunded loan commitments. The allowance for credit losses required under ASC 2016-13 is included in "Allowance for credit losses" on our consolidated balance sheets. The allowance for credit losses attributed to unfunded loan commitments is included in "Other liabilities" in the consolidated balance sheets. The change to the allowance for credit loss recorded on January 1, 2023 is reflected as a direct charge to retained earnings on our consolidated statements of changes in equity; however subsequent changes to the allowance for credit losses are recognized through net income on our consolidated statements of operations. In connection with the adoption of ASU 2016-13, we recorded a million decrease to accumulated earnings as of January 1, 2023. 
 
 The Company's implementation process included a selection of a credit loss analytical model, completion and documentation of policies and procedures, changes to internal reporting processes and related internal controls and additional disclosures. A control framework for governance, data, forecast and model controls was developed to support the allowance for credit losses process. Determining an allowance for credit loss estimate requires significant judgment and a variety of subjective assumptions, including (i) determination of relevant historical loan loss data sets, (ii) the current credit quality of loans and operating performance of loan collateral and the Company's expectations of performance and (iii) expectation of macroeconomic forecasts over the relevant time period. 
 
 The Company estimates the allowance for credit losses for its portfolio on a collective basis, including unfunded loan commitments, for loans that share similar risk characteristics. The calculation is applied at the loan level. The allowance for credit losses estimation methodology used by LFT includes a probability of default and loss given default method utilizing a widely-used third-party analytical model with historical loan losses for over commercial real estate loans dating back to 1998. Within this data set, we focused our historical loss information on the most relevant subset of available CRE data, which we determined based on loan metrics that are most comparable to our loan portfolio including asset type, spread to interest rate, unpaid principal balance and origination loan-to-value, or LTV. The Company expects to use this proxy data set, or variants of it, unless the Company develops its own sufficient history of realized losses. The Company determined the key variables driving its allowance for credit losses estimate are debt service coverage ratio and LTV ratio. Other notable variables include property type, property location and loan vintage. The Company determines its allowance for credit loss estimate based on the weighting of multiple macroeconomic forecast scenarios driven by macroeconomic variables such as gross domestic product ("GDP"), unemployment rate, federal funds target rate and core personal consumption expenditure ("CPR") among others, during the reasonable and supportable forecast period. The reasonable and supportable forecast period is currently one year, however, the Company regularly evaluates the reasonable and supportable forecast period to determine if a change is needed based on our assessment of the most likely scenario of assumptions and plausible outcomes for the U.S. economy. For the period beyond which the Company is able to make reasonable and supportable forecasts, the Company reverts, on a straight-line basis over four quarters, to the historical loss information derived from CRE data set. 
 
 Any loans considered to be a Default Risk or otherwise deemed to be collateral dependent will be individually evaluated for a specific allowance for credit losses. A loan is considered collateral dependent when the Company determines that the facts and circumstances of the loan deem the debtor to be experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the sale or operation of the collateral. If a loan is considered to be collateral dependent, a specific allowance for credit losses is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the loan through a charge to the provision for credit losses. The specific allowance for credit losses is measured by comparing the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, less costs to sell, to the amortized cost of the respective loan. These valuations require significant judgments, which include assumptions regarding capitalization rates, leasing, creditworthiness of major tenants, occupancy rates, availability of financing, exit plan, actions of other lenders, and other factors deemed necessary by the Manager. Actual losses, if any, could ultimately differ from estimated losses. 
 
 Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13, the Company established an allowance for credit loss under the incurred loss model which required analysis of Default Risk loans and those determined to be collateral dependent in a manner consistent with the specific allowance described above. In addition, the Company evaluated the entire loan portfolio to determine whether the portfolio had any impairment that required a valuation allowance on the remainder of the portfolio.

 Quarterly, the Company assesses the risk factors of each loan classified as held-for-investment and assigns a risk rating based on a variety of factors, including, without limitation, debt-service coverage ratio ("DSCR"), loan-to-value ratio ("LTV"), property type, geographic and local market dynamics, physical condition, leasing and tenant profile, adherence to business plan and exit plan, maturity default risk and project sponsorship. The Company's loans are rated on a 5-point scale, from least risk to greatest risk, respectively, which ratings are described as follows: 
 
 1. Very Low Risk : exceeds expectations and is outperforming underwriting or it is very likely that the underlying loan can be refinanced easily in the period's prevailing capital market conditions 
 2. Low Risk : meeting or exceeding underwritten expectations 
 3. Moderate Risk : consistent with underwritten expectations or the sponsor may be in the early stages of executing the business plan and the loan structure appropriately mitigates additional risks 
 4. High Risk : potential risk of default, a loss may occur in the event of default 
 5. Default Risk : imminent risk of default, a loss is likely in the event of default 
 
 . Renovations and/or replacements that improve or extend the life of the REO asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. The cost of ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. REO assets are classified as held for sale in the period when they meet the criteria under ASC Topic 360, " Property, Plant and Equipment ." Once a REO asset is classified as held for sale, depreciation is suspended and the asset is reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value less cost to sell. 
 
 REO assets are reviewed for impairment each quarter if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company recognizes impairment if the undiscounted estimated cash flows to be generated by an asset is less than the carrying amount of such asset. Measurement of impairment is based on the asset's estimated fair value. The evaluation of anticipated future cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates, capital requirements and anticipated holding periods that could differ materially from actual results.

million credit and guaranty agreement with the lenders referred to therein and Cortland Capital Service LLC, as administrative agent and collateral agent for the lenders (the "Secured Term Loan"). The Secured Term Loan is carried at its unpaid principal balance, net of deferred financing costs. Deferred financing costs associated with this liability are amortized to interest expense on a straight line basis when it approximates the effective interest method. See Note 6 for additional information related to the Secured Term Loan.

 million in the allowance for credit losses, bringing the total allowance for credit losses to million as of September 30, 2024.

For purposes of calculating the management fee, the Company's stockholders' equity includes the sum of the net proceeds from all issuances of the Company's equity securities since inception (allocated on a pro rata daily basis for such issuances during the fiscal quarter of any such issuance), plus the Company's retained earnings at the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter (without taking into account any non-cash equity compensation expense incurred in current or prior periods), less any amount that the Company paid for repurchases of the Company's common stock since inception, and excluding any unrealized gains, losses or other items that did not affect realized net income (regardless of whether such items were included in other comprehensive income or loss, or in net income).

To the extent a participation interest is involved, a pro rata portion of any fees associated with the underlying loan will be included with such participation. If the Company receives less than a pro rata portion of the fees, the Manager will disclose such arrangement and seek consent from the Company prior to transfer.

 from the sale of a mortgage. FOAC's obligation to provide further seller eligibility review and backstop guarantee services terminated on the MAXEX Termination Date. Pursuant to an Assumption Agreement dated December 31, 2018, among MAXEX Clearing LLC and FOAC, MAXEX Clearing LLC assumed all of FOAC's obligations under its backstop guarantees and agreed to indemnify and hold FOAC harmless against any losses, liabilities, costs, expenses and obligations under the backstop guarantee. FOAC paid MAXEX Clearing LLC, as the replacement backstop provider, a fee of (the "Alternate Backstop Fee"). MAXEX Clearing LLC represented to FOAC in the Assumption Agreement that it (i) is rated at least "A" (or equivalent) by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating agency or (ii) has (a) adjusted tangible net worth of at least million and (b) minimum available liquidity equal to the greater of (x) million and (y) multiplied by the scheduled unpaid principal balance of each outstanding loan covered by the backstop guarantees. MAXEX's chief financial officer is required to certify ongoing compliance by MAXEX Clearing LLC with the aforementioned criteria on a quarterly basis and if MAXEX Clearing LLC fails to satisfy such criteria, MAXEX Clearing LLC is required to deposit into an escrow account for FOAC's benefit an amount equal to the greater of (A) the unamortized Alternate Backstop Fee for each outstanding loan covered by the backstop guarantee and (B) the product of multiplied by the scheduled unpaid principal balance of each outstanding loan covered by the backstop guarantees. 
 
 The maximum potential amount of future payments that the Company could be required to make under the outstanding backstop guarantees, which represents the outstanding balance of all underlying mortgage loans sold by approved sellers to MAXEX Clearing LLC, was estimated to be million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, although the Company believes this amount is not indicative of the Company's actual potential losses. Amounts payable in excess of the outstanding principal balance of the related mortgage, for example any premium paid by the loan buyer or costs associated with collecting mortgage payments, are not currently estimable. Amounts that may become payable under the backstop guarantee are normally recoverable from the related seller, as well as from any payments received on (or from the sale of property securing) the mortgage loan repurchased and, as noted above, MAXEX Clearing LLC has assumed all of FOAC's obligations in respect of its backstop guarantees. Pursuant to the Master Agreement, FOAC is required to maintain minimum available liquidity equal to the greater of (i) million or (ii) of the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans backstopped by FOAC, either directly or through a credit support agreement acceptable by MAXEX. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was not aware of any circumstances expected to lead to the triggering of a backstop guarantee obligation. 
 
 In addition, the Company enters into certain contracts that contain a variety of indemnification obligations, principally with the Manager, brokers and counterparties to repurchase agreements. The maximum potential future payment amount the Company could be required to pay under these indemnification obligations is unlimited. The Company has not incurred any costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to the indemnification obligations. As a result, the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal. Accordingly, the Company recorded liabilities for these agreements as of September 30, 2024.

 On December 15, 2015, the Board authorized a stock repurchase program (or the "Repurchase Program"), to repurchase up to million of the Company's outstanding common stock. Shares of the Company's common stock may be purchased in the open market, including through block purchases, or through privately negotiated transactions, or pursuant to any trading plan that may be adopted in accordance with Rule 10b-18(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases will be determined at the Company's discretion and the program may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason. Among other factors, the Company intends to only consider repurchasing shares of the Company's common stock when the purchase price is less than the Company's estimate of the Company's current net asset value per common share. Shares of common stock repurchased by the Company under the Repurchase Program, if any, will be canceled and, until reissued by the Company, will be deemed to be authorized but unissued shares of the Company's common stock. share repurchases have been made since January 19, 2016. Through September 30, 2024, the Company had repurchased shares of common stock at a weighted average share price of . As of September 30, 2024, million of common stock remained authorized for future share repurchase under the Repurchase Program.

 Independent Directors Stock-for-Fees Program 
 
 Upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee of the Board, on April 20, 2023, the Board adopted the Independent Directors Stock-for-Fees Program (the Stock-for-Fees Program ). The purpose of the Stock-for-Fees Program is to promote the long-term success of the Company and further align the interests of the Company s independent directors with the interests of its stockholders by providing the independent directors with an opportunity to elect to receive their Director Fees (as defined below) in the form of shares of common stock. 
 
 Pursuant to the Stock-for-Fees Program, an independent director may elect to exchange all or a portion of such director s unpaid Director Fees for the right to receive payment of such unpaid fees in the form of shares of common stock. Such election will apply to all Director Fees that would otherwise have been paid (but for such election) in the fiscal quarter that commences after the date the independent director s election form is filed with and received by the Company and will continue for each fiscal quarter through and until the fiscal quarter that commences after such time as the director files a new election form that is received by the Company modifying or terminating such prior election or, if earlier, the date such Director terminates service on the Board. Unless otherwise approved by the Board, an election by an independent director will be made only in an open trading window pursuant to the Company s insider trading policy. Unless otherwise approved by the Board, an independent director may not make more than election in any period of time. Any Director Fees that an independent director elects to receive in the form of shares of common stock are referred to as Exchanged Fees. 
 
 Upon any Exchange Date (as defined below) that occurs after an independent director files an election form that is received by the Company, the independent director will be entitled to receive a number of shares of common stock determined by dividing (i) the amount of the Exchanged Fees that would otherwise have been paid to the independent director in cash on such Exchange Date but for such election, by (ii) the Fair Market Value (as defined below) of a share of common stock as of such Exchange Date, and rounding down to the nearest whole share. Any fractional amount less than the Fair Market Value of a share of common stock as of such Exchange Date will be paid in cash. Any shares of common stock acquired by an independent director pursuant to the Stock-for-Fees Program will be fully vested at all times. 
 
 The maximum aggregate number of shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the Stock-for-Fees Program is . The maximum aggregate number of shares issuable to an independent director pursuant to the Stock-for-Fees Program shall not exceed shares of common stock. The Company issued shares with a weighted-average share price of in 2023 and has issued shares with a weighted-average price of pursuant to the Stock-for-Fees Program during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 For purposes of the Stock-for-Fees Program, the following definitions apply: 
 
 Director Fees means the annual retainer and meeting fees, to the extent otherwise payable in cash, payable to an independent director for services as a member of the Board. 
 
 Exchange Date means any date on which the Company pays Director Fees to independent directors. 
 
 Fair Market Value means, with respect to an Exchange Date, the average of the closing prices of a share of the Company s common stock as reported on the composite tape for securities listed on the NYSE for the period of trading days ending on the trading day immediately preceding the Exchange Date.

 Overview 
 
 We are a Maryland corporation that is focused on investing in, originating, financing and managing a portfolio of commercial real estate ("CRE") debt investments. 
 
 In January 2020, we entered into a series of transactions with subsidiaries of ORIX Corporation USA ("ORIX USA"), a diversified financial company with the ability to provide investment capital and asset management services to clients in the corporate, real estate and municipal finance sectors. We entered into a new management agreement with Lument IM, while another affiliate of ORIX USA purchased an ownership stake of approximately 5.0 through a privately-placed stock issuance. On February 22, 2022, the affiliate purchased an additional 13,071,895 shares of common stock from a transferable common stock rights offering, increasing its beneficial ownership in the Company to approximately 27.4 . These transactions have enhanced the scale of LFT and are expected to generate shareholder value through leveraging ORIX USA's expansive originations, asset management and servicing platform. 
 
 Lument IM is an affiliate of Lument, a nationally recognized leader in multifamily and seniors housing and health care finance. The Company leverages Lument's broad platform and significant expertise when originating, underwriting and asset managing its investments. 
 
 We invest primarily in transitional floating rate CRE mortgage loans with an emphasis on middle market multifamily assets. We may also invest in other CRE-related investments including mezzanine loans, preferred equity, commercial mortgage-backed securities, fixed rate loans, construction loans and other CRE debt instruments. We finance our current investments in transitional multifamily and other CRE loans primarily through matched term non-recourse secured borrowings, including collateralized loan obligations ("CLO"), which are not subject to margin calls or additional collateralization requirements. We may utilize warehouse repurchase agreements or other forms of financing in the future. Our primary sources of income are net interest from our investment portfolio and non-interest income from our mortgage loan-related activities. Net interest income represents the interest income we earn on investments less the expense of funding these investments. 
 
 Our investments typically have the following characteristics: 
 
 Sponsors with experience in particular real estate sectors and geographic markets; 
 Located in U.S. markets with multiple demand drivers, such as growth in employment and household formation; 
 Fully funded principal balance greater than 5 million and generally less than 75 million; 
 Loan to Value ratio up to 85 of as-is value and up to 75 of as-stabilized value; 
 Floating rate loans tied to one-month term SOFR; and 
 Three-year term with two one-year extension options. 
 
 We believe that our current investment strategy provides significant opportunities to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders over time. However, to capitalize on the investment opportunities at different points in the economic and real estate investment cycle, we may modify or expand our investment strategy. We believe that the flexibility of our strategy, which is supported by the significant CRE experience of Lument's investment team, and the extensive resources of ORIX USA, will allow us to take advantage of changing market conditions to maximize risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders. 
 
 We have elected to be taxed as a REIT and comply with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code with respect thereto. Accordingly, we are generally not subject to federal income tax on our REIT taxable income that we currently distribute to our stockholders so long as we maintain our qualification as a REIT. Our continued qualification as a REIT depends on our ability to meet, on a continuing basis, various complex requirements under the Internal Revenue Code relating to, among other things, the source of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets, our distribution levels and the concentration of ownership of our capital stock. Even if we maintain our qualification as a REIT, we may become subject to some federal, state and local taxes on our income generated in our wholly owned taxable REIT subsidiary, Five Oaks Acquisition Corp. ("FOAC").

Recent Developments 
 The last several quarters have been characterized by significant volatility in global markets, driven by heightened inflation, higher interest rates, slowing economic growth, geopolitical uncertainty and instability in the banking sector following multiple bank failures. Inflation reached generational highs in many economies, prompting central banks to take monetary policy tightening actions that have and are likely continue to create headwinds to economic growth. 
 
 Although the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by 0.50 and 0.25 on September 18, 2024 and November 7, 2024, respectively, interest rates remain elevated, and the timing, direction and extent of any future interest rate changes remain uncertain. Although our business model is such that higher interest rates will, all else being equal, correlate to increases in our net income, interest rates remaining elevated for an extended period of time may adversely affect our existing borrowers. Additionally, higher interest rates and unpredictable geopolitical landscape may cause further dislocation in the capital markets resulting in a continual reduction of available liquidity and an increase in borrowing costs. A lack of liquidity for a prolonged period of time could limit our ability to grow our business. It remains difficult to predict the full impact of recent events and any future changes in interest rate or inflation.

 Factors Impacting Our Operating Results 
 
 Market conditions . The results of our operations are and will continue to be affected by a number of factors and primarily depend on, among other things, the level of our net interest income, the market value of our assets and the supply of, and demand for, our target assets in the marketplace. Our net interest income, will vary primarily as a result of changes in market interest rates and prepayment speeds, and by the ability of the borrowers underlying our commercial mortgage loans to continue making payments in accordance with the contractual terms of their loans, which may be impacted by unanticipated credit events experienced by such borrowers. Interest rates vary according to the type of investment, conditions in the financial markets, competition and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. Our operating results will also be affected by general U.S. real estate fundamentals and the overall U.S. economic environment. In particular, our strategy is influenced by the specific characteristics of the underlying real estate markets, including prepayment rates, credit market conditions and interest rates. 
 
 Changes in market interest rates . Generally, our business model is such that rising interest rates will increase our net interest income, while declining interest rates will decrease our net interest income. As of September 30, 2024, 99.9 of our investments by total investment exposure earned a floating rate of interest, of which 100.0 were indexed to 30-day term SOFR, and all of our collateralized loan obligations and secured financings were indexed to 30-day term SOFR, and as a result we are less sensitive to variability in our net interest income resulting from interest rate changes. As of September 30, 2024, 99.1 of the loans in our commercial mortgage loan portfolio are structured with SOFR floors with a weighted average SOFR floor of 0.55 , none of which currently has a floor greater than the current spot interest rate. When interest rates are above our average interest rate floor, an increase in interest rates will increase our interest income. Alternatively, when interest rates are below our average interest rate floor, an increase in interest rates will decrease our net interest income until such time as interest rates rise above our average interest rate floor. Although our Manager is currently originating loans with SOFR floors, there can be no assurance that we will continue to obtain SOFR floors on future originations or acquisitions. Similarly, net interest income is also impacted by the spread in our commercial mortgage loan portfolio. As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average spread of our commercial loan portfolio was 3.58 , but there is no assurance that these spreads will be maintained as market environments fluctuate. 
 
 The Federal Reserve maintained the federal funds target range at 0.0 to 0.25 for much of 2021. However, beginning in March 2022, the Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate eleven times, increasing the federal funds target range to 5.25 to 5.50 . On September 18, 2024 and November 7, 2024, 2024, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by 0.50 and 0.25 , respectively, however, interest rates remain elevated, and the timing, direction and extent of any future interest rate changes remain uncertain. 
 
 In addition to the risk related to fluctuations in cash flows associated with movements in interest rates, there is also the risk of non-performance on floating rate assets. With the continuation in elevated interest rates, the additional debt service payments due from our borrowers have been strained and may continue to strain the operating cash flows of the real estate assets underlying our mortgages and/or impact their ability to be refinanced at such higher interest rates, and potentially, contribute to non-performance or, in severe cases, default. This risk is partially mitigated during the underwriting process, which generally includes a requirement for our borrowers to purchase interest rate cap contracts with an unaffiliated third-party, provide an interest rate reserve deposit, and/or provide other structural protections. As of September 30, 2024, 95.3 of our performing loans have interest rate caps with a weighted-average strike price of 2.9 . 
 
 Credit risk . Our commercial mortgage loans and other investments are also subject to credit risk. The performance and value of our loans and other investments depend upon the sponsor's ability to operate properties that serve as our collateral so that they produce cash flows adequate to pay interest and principal due to us. To monitor this risk, the Manager's asset management team reviews our portfolio and maintains regular contact with borrowers, co-lenders 
 26 

and local market experts to monitor the performance of the underlying collateral, anticipate borrower, property and market issues and, to the extent necessary or appropriate, enforce our rights as lender. The market values of commercial mortgage assets are subject to volatility and may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, national, regional and local economic conditions (which may be adversely affected by industry slowdowns and other factors); local real estate conditions; changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments; construction quality, age and design; demographic factors; and retroactive changes to building or similar codes. In addition, decreases in property values reduce the value of the collateral and potential proceeds available to a borrower to repay the underlying loans, which could also cause us to suffer losses. As of September 30, 2024, 98.8 of the commercial mortgage loans in our portfolio were current as to principal and interest. Additionally, we have reviewed the loans designated as Default Risk for specific allowance for credit loses. Specific allowance for credit losses of these loans, which are collateral dependent, is measured by comparing the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, less costs to sell, to the book value of the respective loan. We can provide no assurances that our borrowers will remain current as to principal and interest, or that we will not enter into forbearance agreements or loan modifications in order to protect the value of our commercial mortgage loan assets. Should that occur, it could have a material negative impact on our results of operations. 
 
 Liquidity and financing markets. Liquidity is a measurement of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to pay dividends, fund investments and repay borrowings and other general business needs. Our primary sources of liquidity have been proceeds of common or preferred stock issuances, net proceeds from corporate debt obligations, net cash provided by operating activities and other financing arrangements. We finance our commercial mortgage loans primarily with non-recourse secured borrowings, the maturities of which are matched to the maturities of the loans, and which are not subject to margin calls or additional collateralization requirements. However, to the extent that we seek to invest in additional commercial mortgage loans outside of our secured borrowings, we will in part be dependent on our ability to issue additional collateralized loan obligations, to secure alternative financing facilities or to raise additional common or preferred equity. 
 
 Prepayment speeds . Prepayment risk is the risk that principal will be repaid at a different rate than anticipated, causing the return on certain investments to be less than expected. As we receive prepayments of principal on our assets, any premiums paid on such assets are amortized against interest income. In general, an increase in prepayment rates accelerates the amortization of purchase premiums, thereby reducing the interest income earned on the assets. Conversely, discounts on such assets are accreted into interest income. In general, an increase in prepayment rates accelerates the accretion of purchase discounts, thereby increasing the interest earned on the assets. With the exception of twenty-nine loans acquired and seventeen funded loan advances with an initial aggregate unpaid principal balance of 473.1 million with an aggregate purchase discount of 8.1 million, all of our commercial mortgage loans were acquired at par. As of September 30, 2024, our aggregate unamortized purchase discount was 4.3 million, and accordingly we do not believe this to be a material risk to interest income for us at present. Additionally, we are subject to prepayment risk associated with the terms of our secured borrowings. Due to the generally short-term nature of transitional floating-rate commercial mortgage loans, our secured borrowings include a reinvestment period during which principal repayments and prepayments on our commercial mortgage loans may be reinvested in similar assets, subject to meeting certain eligibility criteria. The reinvestment period for the 2021-FL1 CLO expired in December 2023 and for LMF 2023-1 remains in place through July 2025. While the interest-rate spreads of our secured borrowings are fixed until they are repaid, the terms, including spreads, of newly originated loans are subject to uncertainty based on a variety of factors, including market and competitive conditions, which remain uncertain and volatile in light of the current inflationary environment. To the extent that such conditions result in lower spreads on the assets in which we reinvest, we may be subject to a reduction in interest income in the future. However, our loan agreements provide for prepayment penalties which are intended to offset any potential reduction in future interest income. 
 
 Changes in market value of our assets . We account for our commercial mortgage loans at amortized cost. As such, our earnings will generally not be directly impacted by changes in the market values of these loans. However, if a loan is considered to be impaired as a result of adverse credit performance, an allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying value through a charge to the provision for credit losses. Impairment is measured by comparing the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, less costs to sell, to the book value of the respective loan. Provisions for (reversal of) credit losses will directly impact our earnings. 
 
 Key Financial Measure and Indicators 
 
 As a real estate investment trust, we believe the key financial measures and indicators for our business are earnings per share, dividends declared, Distributable Earnings, and book value per share of common stock. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded earnings per share of 0.10, declared a quarterly dividend of 0.08 per share, and reported 0.10 per share of Distributable Earnings. In addition, our book value per share of common stock was 3.50. 
 
 As further described below, Distributable Earnings is a measure that is not prepared in accordance with GAAP, which helps us to evaluate our performance excluding the effects of certain transactions and GAAP adjustments that we believe are not necessarily indicative of our current loan portfolio and operations. In addition, Distributable Earnings is a performance metric we consider when declaring our dividends. 
 
 Earnings Per Share and Dividends Declared 
 
 The following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted net income per share and dividends declared per share: Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 Net income (1)

 (1) Represents net income attributable to Lument Finance Trust, Inc. common stockholders 
 
 Distributable Earnings 
 
 Distributable Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure, which we define as GAAP net income (loss) attributable to holders of common stock, or, without duplication, owners of our subsidiaries, computed in accordance with GAAP, including realized losses not otherwise included in GAAP net income (loss) and excluding (i) non-cash equity compensation, (ii) depreciation and amortization, (iii) any unrealized gains or losses or other similar non-cash items that are included in net income for that applicable reporting period, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income (loss) or net 
 27 

income (loss), and (iv) one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain material non-cash income or expense items after discussions with the Board and approved by a majority of the Company's independent directors. 
 
 While Distributable Earnings excludes the impact of any unrealized provisions for credit losses, any credit losses are charged off and realized through Distributable Earnings when deemed non-recoverable. Non-recoverability is determined (i) upon the resolution of a loan (i.e. when the loan is repaid, fully or partially, or in the case of foreclosures, when the underlying asset is sold), or (ii) with respect to any amount due under any loan, when such amount is determined to be non-collectible. 
 
 We believe that Distributable Earnings provides meaningful information to consider in addition to our net income (loss) and cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. We believe Distributable Earnings is a useful financial metric for existing and potential future holders of our common stock as historically, over time, Distributable Earnings has been a strong indicator of our dividends per share. As a REIT, we generally must distribute annually at least 90 of our taxable income, subject to certain adjustments, and therefore we believe our dividends are one of the principal reasons stockholders may invest in our common stock. Refer to Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our distribution requirements as a REIT. Furthermore, Distributable Earnings help us to evaluate our performance excluding the effects of certain transactions and GAAP adjustments that we believe are not necessarily indicative of our current loan portfolio and operations, and is a performance metric we consider when declaring our dividends. 
 
 Distributable Earnings does not represent net income (loss) or cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income (loss), or an indication of GAAP cash flows from operations, a measure of our liquidity, or an indication of funds available for our cash needs. In addition, our methodology for calculating Distributable Earnings may differ from the methodologies employed by other companies to calculate the same or similar performance measures, and accordingly, our reported Distributable Earnings may not be comparable to the Distributable Earnings reported by other companies. 
 
 The following table provides a reconciliation of Distributable Earnings to GAAP net income:

 We did not have any impaired loans, non-accrual loans, or loans in maturity default other than the loans discussed below as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 
 During the period ended September 30, 2024, management identified one loan, collateralized by a multifamily property in Brooklyn, NY, with an unpaid principal value of 17.3 million as requiring individual evaluation for a specific allowance for credit losses due to maturity default, and a resulting risk rating of "5"; however no specific allowance for credit losses were required after analysis of the underlying collateral value. This loan has been on non-accrual status since June 30, 2024 as a result of the maturity default, with interest recorded as income on a cash basis. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized 0.4 million of interest on this loan. 
 
 During the period ended September 30, 2024, management identified one loan, collateralized by two multifamily properties near Augusta, GA, with an unpaid aggregate principal value of 20.3 million as requiring individual evaluation for a specific allowance for credit losses due to monetary default, and a resulting risk rating of "5"; however no specific allowance for credit losses were required after analysis of the underlying collateral value. This loan has been on non-accrual status since March 31, 2024 as a result of monetary default, with interest recognized as income on a cash basis. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized 0.7 million of interest on this loan and for the six months ended September 30, 2024, during which this loan has been on non-accrual status the Company recognized 1.2 million of interest on this loan. 
 
 During the period ended September 30, 2024, management identified one loan, collateralized by two multifamily properties in Philadelphia, PA, with an unpaid aggregate principal value of 15.0 million as requiring individual evaluation for a specific allowance for credit losses due to monetary default, and a resulting risk rating of "5"; a specific allowance of 0.9 million for credit losses was required after analysis of the underlying collateral value. This loan has been on non-accrual status since June 30, 2024 as a result of monetary default, with interest collections accounted for under the cost recovery method. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company applied 0.3 million in interest received from the borrower as a reduction in the carrying basis of this loan. 
 
 During the period ended September 30, 2024, management identified one loan, collateralized by a multifamily property in Dallas, TX, with an unpaid aggregate principal value of 31.6 million as requiring individual evaluation for a specific allowance for credit losses due to technical default, and a resulting risk rating of "5"; however no specific allowance for credit losses were required after analysis of the underlying collateral value. 
 
 In February 2023, in connection with the sale of the office building collateralizing an impaired loan by the borrower to an unaffiliated third-party, the Company accepted a discounted payoff of approximately 6.0 million on the impaired loan, which had an unpaid principal balance of 10.3 million. A specific allowance for credit loss of 4.3 million was recorded for this impaired loan in the year ended December 31, 2022. Upon the discounted payoff, a 4.3 million charge off against the allowance for credit losses was recorded, with de minimis impact to income in the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Throughout 2023, management identified one loan, collateralized by a multifamily property in Columbus, Ohio, with an initial unpaid principal value of 12.8 million as impaired due to monetary default resulting in a risk rating of "5." In the first quarter of 2023, this loan was placed on non-accrual status with interest collections accounted for under the cost recovery method. As of December 31, 2023, the carrying value of this loan was 8.9 million, which reflected a 5.0 million payment received on November 25, 2023 under an insurance claim, of which 3.1 million was applied to carrying value reduction and a 1.9 million payable established primarily related to a tenant settlement. As of December 31, 2023, no specific reserves were required after analysis of the underlying collateral value. In the first quarter of 2024, we received additional insurance proceeds in the amount of 13.5 million which reduced the carrying value of this loan to 0, and after taking into consideration repayment of an interest rate cap and certain legal and other costs and amounts deemed recoverable, resulting in the recognition of approximately 2.5 million of income in the quarter ended March 31, 2024. 
 
 During the period ended December 31, 2023, management identified one loan, collateralized by a multifamily property in Virginia Beach, VA, with an unpaid principal balance of 36.8 million as impaired due to monetary default resulting in a risk rating of "5"; however no specific asset reserves were required after analysis of underlying collateral value. This loan was on non-accrual status as a result of monetary default and impaired loan classification. In the first quarter of 2024, the Company and the borrower entered into a loan modification and the loan was returned to accrual status. In connection with the modification, the borrower, among other things, made a principal payment of approximately 3.6 million and brought current any past due interest, escrows and reserves, which resulted in interest of approximately 0.5 million that was unpaid as of December 31, 2023 recognized as income in the quarter ended March 31, 2024. The note rate on the loan was amended to SOFR + 400 basis points from SOFR + 327 basis points and the stated maturity date of the loan was amended to April 5, 2024, with the ability for borrower to extend, under certain conditions, to May 3, 2024. On May 3, 2024, the loan repaid in full according to the terms of loan modification. 
 
 Our Manager's asset management team pro-actively manages the Company's investment portfolio. The asset management team, together with our Manager's underwriting and servicing teams, monitors the credit performance of the investment portfolio, working closely with borrowers to manage all of our positions and monitor financial performance of our collateral assets, including execution of business plans and daily activities within our investment portfolio. 
 
 Loan modifications and amendments are commonplace in the transitional lending business. We may amend or modify a loan depending on the loan's specific facts and circumstances. These loan modifications typically include additional time for a borrower to refinance or sell their property, adjustment or waiver of performance tests that are prerequisite to the extension of a loan maturity, modification of terms of interest rate cap agreements, and/or deferral of scheduled principal payments. In exchange for a modification, we often receive a partial repayment of principal, a cash infusion to replenish interest or capital improvement reserves, termination of all or a portion of the remaining unfunded loan commitment, additional call protection and/or an increase in the loan coupon or additional fees. We continue to work with our borrowers to address issues as they arise while seeking to preserve the credit attributes of our loan. However, we cannot assure you that these efforts will be successful, and we may experience payment delinquencies, defaults, foreclosures or losses. 
 
 As discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, our Manager performs a quarterly review of our loan portfolio, assesses the performance of each loan, and assigns a risk rating between "1" and "5," from less risk to greater risk. The weighted average risk rating of our total loan exposure was 3.6 as of September 30, 2024 and 3.5 as of December 31, 2023. The change to underlying risk rating consisted of loans that paid off with a risk rating of "3" of 164.1 million, a risk rating of "4" of 37.3 million and a risk rating of "5" of 45.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, 7.0 million of loans with a risk rating of "2" transitioned to a risk rating of "3," 18.9 million of loans with a risk rating of "3" transitioned to a risk rating of 
 32 

"2", 234.4 million of loans with a risk rating of "3" transitioned to a risk rating of "4", 17.3 million of loans with a risk rating of "3" transitioned to a risk rating of "5", 35.5 million of loans with a risk rating of "4" transitioned to a risk rating of "3" and 66.5 million of loans with a risk rating of "4" transitioned to a risk rating of "5". The following table presents the principal balance and net book value based on the Company's internal risk ratings as of September 30, 2024:

 (1) Maximum facility size represents the largest amount of borrowings under a given facility once sufficient collateral assets have been approved by the lender and pledged by us. Collateralized loan obligations maximum facility size reduced by repayment of Class A Notes of 193.8 million. Includes 166.3 million in collateralized loan obligations retained interests and 68.6 million in secured financings retained interests that are eliminated in consolidation in our balance sheets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 (2) Represents the principal balance of the collateral assets. 
 
 Collateralized Loan Obligations and Secured Financings 
 
 On June 14, 2021, the Company completed the 2021-FL1 CLO, issuing eight tranches of CLO notes through two newly-formed wholly-owned subsidiaries totaling 903.8 million. Of the total CLO notes issued 833.8 million were investment grade notes issued to third party investors and 70 million were below investment-grade notes retained by us. In addition, a 96.25 million equity interest in the portfolio was retained by us. The financing had an initial two-and-a-half year reinvestment period that allows principal proceeds of the loan obligations to be reinvested in qualifying replacement loan obligations, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the indenture. Thereafter, the outstanding debt balance will be reduced as loans are repaid. Initially, the proceeds of the issuance of the securities also included 330.3 million for the purpose of acquiring additional loan obligations for a period up to 180 days from the CLO closing date, resulting in the issuer owning loan obligations with a face value of 1.0 billion, representing leverage of 83 . 
 
 On July 12, 2023, the Company entered into and closed a matched-term non-recourse collateralized commercial real estate financing (the "LMF 2023-1 Financing"), secured by 386.4 million of first lien floating-rate multifamily mortgage assets and is not subject to margin calls or additional collateralization requirements. In connection with the LMF 2023-1 Financing, approximately 270.4 million of an investment-grade rated senior secured floating rate loan was provided by a private lender and approximately 47.3 million of investment-grade rated notes (collectively, the "Senior Debt") were issued and sold to an affiliate of LFT's external manager, Lument IM. A consolidated subsidiary of LFT retained the subordinate notes in the issuing vehicle of approximately 
 68.6 million. The Senior Debt has an initial weighted average spread of approximately 314 basis points over 30-day Term SOFR, excluding fees and transaction costs. The Senior Debt matures on the payment date in July 2032, unless it is sooner repaid or redeemed in accordance with its terms. The financing has an initial two-year reinvestment period that allows principal proceeds of the loan obligations to be reinvested in qualifying replacement loan obligations, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the indenture. Thereafter, the outstanding debt balance will be reduced as loans are repaid. 
 
 The following table presents certain loan and borrowing characteristics of 2021-FL1 CLO and LMF 2023-1 Financing as of September 30, 2024:

 Secured Term Loan 
 
 In January 2020, we entered into a 40.25 million secured term loan with an initial maturity of February 2025. In April 2021, we entered into an amendment, providing, among other things, an incremental secured term loan in the amount of 7.5 million and a one-year maturity extension to February 2026. In August 2021, the Company drew down the 7.5 million incremental secured term loan. 
 
 Borrowings under the Secured Term Loan bear interest at a fixed rate of 7.25 for the six-year period following the initial draw-down, which is subject to step up by 0.25 for the first four months after the sixth anniversary of the borrowing of the Secured Term Loan, then by 0.375 for the following four months, then by 0.50 for the last four months until maturity. 
 
 The Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants binding the Company and its subsidiaries that are customary for credit facilities of this type, including, but not limited to: minimum asset coverage ratio; minimum unencumbered assets ratio; maximum total net leverage ratio, minimum tangible net worth; and an interest charge coverage ratio. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with these covenants. 
 
 The Credit Agreement contains events of default that are customary for facilities of this type, including, but not limited to, nonpayment of principal, interest, fees and other amounts when due, violation of covenants, cross default with material indebtedness, and change of control. 
 
 FOAC and Our Residential Mortgage Loan Business 
 
 In June 2013, we established FOAC as a Taxable REIT Subsidiary, or TRS, to increase the range of our investments in mortgage-related assets. Until August 1, 2016, FOAC aggregated mortgage loans primarily for sale into securitization transactions, with the expectation that we would purchase the subordinated tranches issued by the related securitization trusts, and that these would represent high quality credit investments for our portfolio. Residential mortgage loans for which FOAC owns the MSRs continue to be directly serviced by one or more licensed sub-servicers since FOAC does not directly service any residential mortgage loans. 
 
 As noted earlier, we previously determined to cease the aggregation of prime jumbo loans for the foreseeable future, and therefore no longer maintain warehouse financing to acquire prime jumbo loans. We do not expect the previous changes to our mortgage loan business strategy to impact the existing MSRs that we own, or the securitizations we have sponsored to date. 
 
 Pursuant to a Master Agreement dated June 15, 2016, as amended on August 29, 2016, January 30, 2017 and June 27, 2018, among MAXEX, LLC ("MAXEX"), MAXEX Clearing LLC, MAXEX's wholly-owned clearinghouse subsidiary and FOAC, FOAC provided seller eligibility review services under which it reviewed, approved and monitored sellers that sold loans via MAXEX Clearing LLC. To the extent that a seller approved by FOAC failed to honor its obligations to repurchase a loan based on an arbitration finding that it breached its representations and warranties, FOAC was obligated to backstop the seller's repurchase obligation. The term of such backstop guarantee was the earlier of the contractual maturity of the underlying mortgage and its repayment in full. However, the incidence of claims for breaches of representations and warranties over time is considered unlikely to occur more than five years from the sale of a mortgage. FOAC's obligations to provide such seller eligibility review and backstop guarantee services terminated on November 28, 2018. Pursuant to an Assumption Agreement dated December 31, 2018, among MAXEX Clearing LLC and FOAC, MAXEX Clearing LLC assumed all of FOAC's obligations under its backstop guarantees and agreed to indemnify and hold FOAC harmless against any losses, liabilities, costs, expenses and obligations under the backstop guarantee. FOAC paid MAXEX Clearing LLC, as the replacement backstop provider, a fee of 426,770 (the "Alternative Backstop Fee"). MAXEX Clearing LLC represented to FOAC in the Assumption Agreement that it (i) is rated at least "A" (or equivalent) by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating agency or (ii) has (a) adjusted tangible net worth of at least 20.0 million and (b) minimum available liquidity equal to the greater of (x) 5.0 million and (y) 0.1 multiplied by the scheduled unpaid principal balance of each outstanding loan covered by the backstop guarantees. MAXEX's chief financial officer is required to certify ongoing compliance by MAXEX Clearing LLC with the aforementioned criteria on a quarterly basis and if MAXEX Clearing LLC fails to satisfy such criteria, MAXEX Clearing LLC is required to deposit into an escrow account FOAC's benefit an amount equal to the greater of (A) the unamortized Alternative Backstop Fee for each outstanding loan covered by the backstop guarantee and (B) the product of 0.01 multiplied by the scheduled unpaid principal balance of each outstanding loan covered by the backstop guarantees. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on form 10-Q for a further description of MAXEX. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that involve the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties. Accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to understanding our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties that could affect our reported assets and liabilities, as well as our reported revenues and expenses. All of these estimates reflect our best judgments about current, and for some estimates, future economic and market conditions and their effects based on information available as of the date of the financial statements. If conditions change from those expected, it is possible that the judgments and estimates described below could change, which may result in a change in our interest income 
 34 

recognition, allowance for credit losses, future impairment of our investments, and valuation of our investment portfolio, among other effects. We believe that the following accounting policies are among the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. 
 
 Commercial Mortgage Loans Held-for-Investment 
 
 On January 1, 2023, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ("ASU 2016-13") and amendments, which replaces the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss model known as the Current Expected Credit Loss ("CECL") model. CECL amends the previous credit loss model to reflect a reporting entity's current estimate of all expected credit losses, not only based on historical experience and current economic conditions, but also by including reasonable and supportable forecasts incorporating forward-looking information. The measurement of expected credit losses under CECL is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost, and off-balance credit exposures such as unfunded loan commitments. The allowance for credit losses required under ASC 2016-13 is included in "Allowance for credit losses" on our consolidated balance sheets. The allowance for credit losses attributed to unfunded loan commitments is included in "Other liabilities" in the consolidated balance sheets. The change to the allowance for credit loss recorded on January 1, 2023 is reflected as a direct charge to retained earnings on our consolidated statements of changes in equity; however subsequent changes to the allowance for credit losses are recognized through net income on our consolidated statements of operations. In connection with the adoption of ASU 2016-13, we recorded a 3.6 million decrease to accumulated earnings as of January 1, 2023. 
 
 The Company's implementation process included a selection of a credit loss analytical model, completion and documentation of policies and procedures, changes to internal reporting processes and related internal controls and additional disclosures. A control framework for governance, data, forecast and model controls was developed to support the allowance for credit losses process. Determining an allowance for credit loss estimate requires significant judgment and a variety of subjective assumptions, including (i) determination of relevant historical loan loss data sets, (ii) the current credit quality of loans and operating performance of loan collateral and the Company's expectations of performance and (iii) expectation of macroeconomic forecasts over the relevant time period. 
 
 The Company estimates the allowance for credit losses for its portfolio on a collective basis, including unfunded loan commitments, for loans that share similar risk characteristics. The calculation is applied at the loan level. The allowance for credit losses estimation methodology used by LFT includes a probability of default and loss given default method utilizing a widely-used third-party analytical model with historical loan losses for over 125,000 commercial real estate loans dating back to 1998. Within this data set, we focused our historical loss information on the most relevant subset of available CRE data, which we determined based on loan metrics that are most comparable to our loan portfolio including asset type, spread to interest rate, unpaid principal balance and origination loan-to-value, or LTV. The Company expects to use this proxy data set, or variants of it, unless the Company develops its own sufficient history of realized losses. The Company determined the key variables driving its allowance for credit losses estimate are debt service coverage ratio and LTV ratio. Other notable variables include property type, property location and loan vintage. The Company determines its allowance for credit loss estimate based on the weighting of multiple macroeconomic forecast scenarios driven by macroeconomic variables such as gross domestic product ("GDP"), unemployment rate, federal funds target rate and core personal consumption expenditure ("CPR") among others, during the reasonable and supportable forecast period. The reasonable and supportable forecast period is currently one year, however, the Company regularly evaluates the reasonable and supportable forecast period to determine if a change is needed based on our assessment of the most likely scenario of assumptions and plausible outcomes for the U.S. economy. For the period beyond which the Company is able to make reasonable and supportable forecasts, the Company reverts, on a straight-line basis over four quarters, to the historical loss information derived from CRE data set. 
 
 Any loans considered to be a Default Risk or otherwise deemed to be collateral dependent will be individually evaluated for a specific allowance for credit losses. A loan is considered collateral dependent when the Company determines that the facts and circumstances of the loan deem the debtor to be experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the sale or operation of the collateral. If a loan is considered to be collateral dependent, a specific allowance for credit losses is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the loan through a charge to the provision for credit losses. The specific allowance for credit losses is measured by comparing the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, less costs to sell, to the amortized cost of the respective loan. These valuations require significant judgments, which include assumptions regarding capitalization rates, leasing, creditworthiness of major tenants, occupancy rates, availability of financing, exit plan, actions of other lenders, and other factors deemed necessary by the Manager. Actual losses, if any, could ultimately differ from estimated losses. 
 
 Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13, the Company established an allowance for credit loss under the incurred loss model which required analysis of Default Risk loans and those determined to be collateral dependent in a manner consistent with the specific allowance described above. In addition, the Company evaluated the entire loan portfolio to determine whether the portfolio had any impairment that required a valuation allowance on the remainder of the portfolio. 
 
 The following table illustrates the day-one financial statement impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2023: 
 Pre-adoption Transition adjustment Post-adoption Assets Commercial mortgage loans, held-for-investment 1,076,148,186 1,076,148,186 Less: Allowance for credit losses (4,258,668) (3,549,501) (7,808,169) Commercial mortgage loans, held-for-investment, net 1,071,889,518 (3,549,501) 1,068,340,017 Liabilities Other liabilities (1)

 (1) Includes reserve for unfunded loan commitments 
 
 35 

Quarterly, the Company assesses the risk factors of each loan classified as held-for-investment and assigns a risk rating based on a variety of factors, including, without limitation, debt-service coverage ratio ("DSCR"), loan-to-value ratio ("LTV"), property type, geographic and local market dynamics, physical condition, leasing and tenant profile, adherence to business plan and exit plan, maturity default risk and project sponsorship. The Company's loans are rated on a 5-point scale, from least risk to greatest risk, respectively, which ratings are described as follows: 
 
 1. Very Low Risk : exceeds expectations and is outperforming underwriting or it is very likely that the underlying loan can be refinanced easily in the period's prevailing capital market conditions 
 2. Low Risk : meeting or exceeding underwritten expectations 
 3. Moderate Risk : consistent with underwritten expectations or the sponsor may be in the early stages of executing the business plan and the loan structure appropriately mitigates additional risks 
 4. High Risk : potential risk of default, a loss may occur in the event of default 
 5. Default Risk : imminent risk of default, a loss is likely in the event of default 
 
 Capital Allocation 
 
 The following tables set forth our allocated capital by investment type at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 
 
 This information represents non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K, as promulgated by the SEC. We believe that this non-GAAP information enhances the ability of investors to better understand the capital necessary to support each income-earning asset category, and thus our ability to generate operating earnings. While we believe that the non-GAAP information included in this report provides supplemental information to assist investors in analyzing our portfolio, these measures are not in accordance with GAAP, and they should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, our financial information calculated in accordance with GAAP.

 Net Income Summary 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our net income attributable to common stockholders was 5,095,684, or 0.10 basic and diluted net income per average share, compared with net income of 5,174,685, or 0.10 basic and diluted net income per average share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The principal drivers of this net income decrease was a decrease in net interest income from 9,544,365 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 9,484,463 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase in total expenses from 2,445,687 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 2,897,067 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 partially offset by a decrease in total other expense from 719,148 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 303,182 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Net Interest Income 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the three months ended September 30, 2023, our net interest income was 9,484,463 and 9,544,365, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to (i) a 143.1 million decrease in weighted-average principal balance of our loan portfolio; (ii) a 145.0 million increase in weighted-average principal balance of our secured borrowings; (iii) a 34bps increase in weighted-average floating rate for our secured borrowing liabilities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023 and (iv) a 19bps increase in weighted-average spread for our secured borrowing liabilities This was partially offset by (i) a 36bps increase in weighted-average floating rate of our loan portfolio; (ii) a 12bps increase in weighted-average spread on the loan portfolio; (iii) an increase in exit/extension fees of 0.1 million and (iv) an increase in accretion of purchase discount of 0.8 million. 
 
 As disclosed above, we experienced an increase in exit and extension fees in the three months ended September 30, 2024. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we experienced loan payoffs on two loans with net principal balances of 17.2 million which generated exit fees of 0.1 million included in interest income, three loans with net unpaid principal balance of 31.7 million which waived exit fees of 0.2 million resulting in a reduction to expenses reimbursement of 0.1 million included in operating expenses reimbursable to Manager and extended three loans which generated 0.4 million in fees included in interest income. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we experienced loan payoffs on four loans with net principal balances of 48.9 million which generated exit fees of 0.5 million included in interest income, four loans with net unpaid principal balance of 60.8 million which waived exit fees of 0.6 million resulting in a reduction to expense reimbursement of 0.3 million included in operating expenses reimbursable to Manager. 
 
 Expenses 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred management and incentive fees of 1,126,820 representing amounts payable to our Manager under our management agreement. We also incurred operating expenses of 1,770,247, of which 418,553 was payable to our Manager and 1,351,694 was payable directly by us. 
 
 37 

For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred management and incentive fees of 1,072,569 representing amounts payable to our Manager under our management agreement. We also incurred operating expenses of 1,373,118 of which 284,859 was payable to our Manager and 1,088,259 was payable directly by us. 
 
 The period-over-period increase in expenses primarily reflects an increase to reimbursed expenses, accounting, administration, audit, investor relations and professional fees, which more than offset a decrease in pricing fees. 
 
 Other Income (Loss) 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our other loss was 303,182. This loss was driven by provision for credit losses of 317,448 primarily due to changes in macroeconomic assumptions employed in determining the Company's model-based general reserve and net unrealized loss on mortgage servicing rights of 46,017 as a result in reduction in principal balances, which more than offset net servicing income of 60,283. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2023, our other loss was 719,148. This loss was driven by provision for credit losses of 791,563 primarily related to changed in macroeconomic forecast, which ore than offset net servicing income of 70,842 and net unrealized gains on mortgage servicing rights of 1,573 as a result of decreased interest rates in the period. 
 
 The period-over-period decrease to other loss was primarily due to the change in provision for credit losses. 
 
 Income Tax (Benefit) Provision 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a provision for income taxes of 3,489 and for the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized a provision for income taxes in the amount of 19,803. The period-over-period decrease in tax benefit primarily reflects the change in gross deferred revenue at FOAC due to the change in unrealized loss on mortgage servicing rights. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Net Income Summary 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net income attributable to common stockholders was 14,304,312, or 0.27 basic and diluted net income per average share, compared with net income of 11,145,603, or 0.21 basic and diluted net income per average share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The principal drivers of this net income increase was an increase in net interest income from 25,299,713 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 31,999,947 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by an increase in total other expense from 1,046,546 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 3,428,632 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and an increase in total expenses from 9,542,742 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 10,698,611 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Net Interest Income 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our net interest income was 31,999,947 and 25,299,713, respectively. The increase was primarily due to (i) a 142.6 million increase in weighted-average principal balance of our loan portfolio; (ii) a 36bps increase in weighted-average floating rate of our loan portfolio; (iii) a 9bps increase in weighted-average spread on the loan portfolio; (iv) an increase in accretion of purchase discount of 2.2 million;(v) an increase in exit/extension fees of 0.4 million and (vi) one-time income of 2.5 million related to the resolution of a defaulted Columbus, Ohio loan for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023. This was partially offset by (i) a 109.1 million increase in weighted-average principal balance of our secured borrowings; (ii) an 35bps increase in weighted-average floating rate for our secured borrowing liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023 and (iii) a 43bps increase in weighted-average spread for our secured borrowing liabilities; (iv) amortization of debt issuance costs of 0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023; (v) an decrease in interest earned on cash of 0.2 million. 
 
 As disclosed above, we experienced an increase in exit and extension fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we experienced loan payoffs on ten loans with net principal balances of 178.5 million which generated exit fees of 1.4 million included in interest income, four loans with net unpaid principal balance of 49.2 million which waived exit fees of 0.4 million resulting in a reduction to expense reimbursement of 0.2 million included in operating expenses reimbursable to Manager and extended eight loans which generated 0.7 million in fees included in interest income. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we experienced loan payoffs on ten loans with net principal balances of 132.9 million which generated exit fees of 1.7 million included in interest income, five loans with net unpaid principal balance of 94.3 million which waived exit fees of 0.7 million resulting in a reduction to expense reimbursement of 0.8 million included in operating expenses reimbursable to Manager. 
 
 Expenses 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred management and incentive fees of 5,507,768 representing amounts payable to our Manager under our management agreement. We also incurred operating expenses of 5,190,843, of which 1,293,627 was payable to our Manager and 3,897,216 was payable directly by us. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred management and incentive fees of 3,253,205 representing amounts payable to our Manager under our management agreement. We also incurred operating expenses of 6,289,537 of which 1,372,511 was payable to our Manager and 4,917,026 was payable directly by us. 
 
 The period-over-period decrease in operating expenses primarily reflects a decrease in insurance, legal, discontinued deal costs and reimbursed expense fees, which more than offset an increase in incentive fees, accounting, administration, audit, bank and professional fees as well as an increase to CLO fees. 
 
 Other Income (Loss) 
 
 38 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our other loss was 3,428,632. This loss was driven by provision for credit losses of 3,494,024 primarily due to specific reserves taken on a risk-rated "5" multifamily loan and changes in macroeconomic assumptions employed in determining the Company's model-based general reserve and net unrealized loss on mortgage servicing rights of 51,664 as a result of reduction in principal balance in the period, which more than offset net servicing income of 117,056. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our other income was 1,046,546. This loss was driven by provision for credit losses of 1,166,962 and net unrealized losses on mortgage servicing rights of 47,350 as a result of reduction in principal balance in the period, which more than offset net servicing income of 167,766. 
 
 The period-over-period increase to other loss was primarily due to the change in provision for credit losses. 
 Income Tax (Benefit) Provision 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a provision for income taxes of 13,351 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized a provision for income taxes in the amount of 9,780. The period-over-period decrease in tax provision primarily reflects the change in gross deferred revenue at FOAC due to the change in unrealized loss on mortgage servicing rights. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Liquidity is a measurement of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to pay dividends, fund investments, comply with margin requirements, if any, and repay borrowings and other general business needs. Our primary sources of liquidity have been met with net proceeds of common or preferred stock issuance, net proceeds from debt offerings and net cash provided by operating activities. We have added to our liquidity position in February 2022, by completing a transferable common stock rights offering issuing and selling 27,277,269 shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately 81.1 million and in May 2021 by issuing 2,400,000 shares of 7.875 Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock resulting in net proceeds (after underwriting discount and commission but before operating expense) of 58.1 million. We finance our commercial mortgage loans primarily with non-recourse match term secured borrowings, which are not subject to margin calls or additional collateralization requirements. On June 14, 2021, we closed the 2021-FL1 CLO issuing eight tranches of CLO notes totaling 903.8 million. Of the total CLO notes issued, 833.8 million were investment grade notes issued to third-party investors and 70.0 million were below investment-grade notes retained by us. On July 12, 2023, we closed LMF 2023-1 placing 270.4 million of an investment-grade rated senior secured floating-rate loan with a private lender, issued and sold approximately 47.3 million of investment-grade rated notes to an affiliate of our Manager and retained the subordinate interests in the issuing vehicle of approximately 68.6 million. On August 23, 2021 we drew an additional 7.5 million of our Secured Term Loan pursuant to the Third Amendment. As of September 30, 2024, our balance sheet included 47.8 million of a secured term loan and 1.0 billion in collateralized loan financing, gross of discounts and debt issuance costs. Our secured term loan matures in February 2026, our collateralized loan financing is term-matched and matures in 2039 or later and our collateralized financing is match-termed and matures in 2032 or later. However, to the extent that we seek to invest in additional commercial mortgage loans, we will in part be dependent on our ability to issue additional collateralized loan obligations to secure alternative financing facilities or to raise additional common or preferred equity. 
 
 If we were required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we previously recorded our assets, particularly in a financial market that has been significantly disrupted and less liquid as a result of the current inflationary environment. Assets that are illiquid are more difficult to finance, and to the extent that we use leverage to finance assets that become illiquid, we may lose that leverage or have it reduced if such leverage is, at least in part, dependent on the market value of our assets. Assets tend to become less liquid during times of financial stress, which is often the time that liquidity is most needed. As a result, our ability to sell assets or vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions may be limited by liquidity constraints, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We seek to limit our exposure to illiquidity risk to the extent possible, by ensuring that the secured borrowings that we use to finance our commercial mortgage loans are not subject to margin calls or other limitations that are dependent on the market value of the related loan collateral. 
 
 We intend to continue to maintain a level of liquidity in relation to our assets that enables us to meet reasonably anticipated investment requirements and unforeseen business needs but that also allows us to be substantially invested in our target assets. We may misjudge the appropriate amount of our liquidity by maintaining excessive liquidity, which would lower our investment returns, or by maintaining insufficient liquidity, which would force us to liquidate assets into unfavorable market conditions and harm our operating results. As of September 30, 2024, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 45.6 million, compared to 51.2 million as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 47.8 million in outstanding principal under our Senior Secured Term Loan, with a borrowing rate of 7.25 . As of September 30, 2024, the ratio of our recourse debt to equity was 0.2:1. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we consolidated the assets and liabilities of the 2021-FL1 CLO and LMF 2023-1 collateralized financings. The assets of the 2021-FL1 CLO and LMF 2023-1 are restricted and can only be used to fulfill their respective obligations, and accordingly the obligations of the trust, which we classify as collateralized loan obligations, do not have any recourse to us as the consolidator of the trust. As of September 30, 2024, the carrying value of these non-recourse liabilities aggregated to 955.1 million. As of September 30, 2024, our total debt to equity ratio was 4.2:1 on a GAAP basis. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, LCMT had 6.7 million of unfunded commitments related to loans held in LFT 2021-FL1, Ltd. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 The following table sets forth changes in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 
 39 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2024 2023 Cash Flows From Operating Activities 20,800,818 15,513,382 Cash Flows From Investing Activities 201,585,930 (314,183,496) Cash Flows From Financing Activities (208,825,457) 300,937,690 Net Increase in Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash 13,561,291 2,267,576 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash increased by 13.6 million and for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash increased by 2.3 million. 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash provided operating activities totaled 20.8 million and 15.5 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our cash flows from operating activities were primarily driven by interest received from the junior retained notes and preferred shares of the 2021-FL1 CLO and LMF 2023-1 of 29.9 million, interest received from our senior secured loans held outside the VIE we consolidate of 2.7 million, interest received on cash accounts of 2.2 million exceeding cash interest expense paid on our Secured Term Loan of 2.7 million, management and incentive fees of 5.5 million, expense reimbursements of 1.4 million and other operating expenditures of 4.5 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our cash flows from operating activities were primarily driven by interest received from the junior retained notes and preferred shares of the 2021-FL1 CLO of 24.3 million, interest received from our senior secured loans held outside VIE's we consolidate of 1.5 million, interest received on cash accounts of 1.9 million and cash received from mortgage servicing rights of 0.2 million exceeding cash interest expense paid on our Secured Term Loan of 2.6 million, management and incentive fees of 3.3 million, expense reimbursement of 1.6 million and other operating expenditures of 3.4 million. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by investing activities totaled 201.6 million. This was the result of principal repayment of commercial mortgage loans held for investment during the period exceeding the purchase and funding of commercial mortgage loans held for investment. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 net cash used by investing activities totaled 314.2 million. This was the result of cash used for the purchase and funding of commercial mortgage loans held for investment exceeding the principal repayment of commercial mortgage loans held for investment during the period. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities totaled 208.8 million and primarily related to repayment of the outstanding debt related to the 2021-FL1 CLO of 193.8 million, payments of common stock dividends of 11.5 million and payments of preferred stock dividends of 3.6 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities totaled 300.9 million primarily related to proceeds from issuance of an investment-grade senior secured floating rate loan of 270.4 million and issuance of 47.3 million in investment-grade rated notes which more than offset payments of common stock dividends of 9.4 million and payment of preferred stock dividends of 3.6 million. 
 
 Forward-Looking Statements Regarding Liquidity 
 
 Based upon our current portfolio, leverage rate and available borrowing arrangements, we believe that the net proceeds of our prior equity sales combined with cash flow from operations and available borrowing capacity will be sufficient to enable us to meet anticipated short-term (one year or less) liquidity requirements to fund our investment activities, pay fees under our management agreement, fund our distributions to stockholders and for other general corporate expenses. 
 
 Our ability to meet our long-term (greater than one-year) liquidity and capital resource requirements will be subject to, amongst other things, obtaining additional debt financing and equity capital. We may increase our capital resources by obtaining long-term credit facilities, additional secured borrowings, including collateralized loan obligations, or making additional public or private offerings of equity or debt securities, possibly including classes of preferred stock, common stock and senior and subordinated notes. 
 
 To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we generally must distribute annually at least 90 of our "REIT taxable income" (determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain). These distribution requirements limit our ability to retain earnings and thereby replenish or increase capital for operations. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we did not maintain any relationships with unconsolidated financial partnerships, or special purpose or variable interest entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Further, as of September 30, 2024, we had not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities or entered into any commitment or intent to provide funding to any such entities. 
 
 In connection with the provision of seller eligibility and backstop guarantee services provided to MAXEX, we previously accounted for the related non-contingent liability at its fair value on our consolidated balance sheet as a liability. As of September 30, 2024, pursuant to an Assumption Agreement dated December 31, 2018, among MAXEX Clearing LLC and FOAC, MAXEX Clearing LLC assumed all of FOAC's obligations under its backstop guarantees and agreed to indemnify and hold FOAC harmless against any losses, liabilities, costs, expenses and obligations under the backstop guarantee, see Note 10 for further information. 
 
 Distributions 
 40 

We intend to continue to make regular quarterly distributions to holders of our common stock. U.S. federal income tax law generally requires that a REIT distribute annually at least 90 of its "REIT taxable income" (determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain) and that it pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it annually distributes less than 100 of its "REIT taxable income." We have historically made regular monthly distributions, and with effect from the third quarter of 2018 we now make regular quarterly distributions, to our stockholders in an amount equal to all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income. Although FOAC no longer aggregates and securitizes residential mortgages, it continues to generate taxable income from MSRs and other mortgage-related activities. This taxable income will be subject to regular corporate income taxes. We generally anticipate the retention of profits generated and taxed at FOAC. Before we make any distribution on our common stock, whether for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise, we must first meet both our operating requirements and any debt service obligations on debt payable. If cash available for distribution to our stockholders is less than our taxable income, we could be required to sell assets or borrow funds to make cash distributions, or we may make a portion of the required distribution in the form of a taxable stock distribution or distribution of debt securities. 
 
 If substantially all of our taxable income has not been paid by the close of any calendar year, we may declare a special dividend prior to the end of such calendar year, to achieve this result. On September 16, 2024, we announced that our Board had declared a cash dividend rate for the third quarter of 2024 of 0.08 per share of common stock which was paid on October 15, 2024 and declared a cash dividend rate for the third quarter of 2024 of 0.49219 per share of Series A Preferred Stock which was paid on October 15, 2024.
