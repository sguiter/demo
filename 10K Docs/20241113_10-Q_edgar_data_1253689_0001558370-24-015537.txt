 GLYCOMIMETICS, INC. Notes to Unaudited Financial Statement s . The Company also initiated a strategic review of its business in an effort to maximize shareholder value. Following the strategic review on October 28, 2024 the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the Merger Agreement) with Crescent Biopharma, Inc., a Delaware corporation (Crescent), pursuant to which Crescent will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the Merger). Upon completion of the Merger, the Company plans to operate under the name Crescent Biopharma, Inc. The Merger is expected to close in the second quarter of 2025, subject to certain closing conditions, including, among other things, approval by the stockholders of each company and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. The Merger is intended to qualify for federal income tax purposes as a tax-free reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Pursuant to the exchange ratio formula set forth in the Merger Agreement, upon the closing of the Merger (but prior to closing of the Private Placement described below), on a pro forma basis and based upon the number of shares of common stock of the Company expected to be issued in the Merger, pre-Merger Crescent stockholders will own approximately of the combined company and pre-Merger stockholders of the Company will own approximately of the combined company. After giving further effect to the Private Placement, the pre-Merger Crescent stockholders (inclusive of those investors participating in the Private Placement) are expected to own approximately of the combined company and the pre-Merger stockholders of the Company are expected to own approximately of the combined company. The exchange ratio will be adjusted to the extent that the Company s net cash at closing of the Merger is less than million and will be based on the amount of proceeds actually received by the Company in the Private Placement. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, certain institutional and accredited investors have entered into a securities purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with the Company, pursuant to which they have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions of such agreements, to purchase, immediately following the consummation of the Merger, shares of the Company s common stock and pre-funded warrants (together, the PIPE Securities) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million in a private placement (the Private Placement). The closing of the Private Placement is conditioned on the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement (in addition to other customary closing conditions) and is expected to occur immediately following the closing of the Merger. million and had net cash flows used in operating activities of million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, the Company had million in cash and cash equivalents and had no committed source of additional funding from either debt or equity financings. Management believes that given the Company s current cash position and forecasted negative cash flows from operating activities over the next twelve months, there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern after the date that is one year from the

 component. The lease component results in a right-of-use asset being recorded on the balance sheet and amortized as lease expense on a straight-line basis. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable. As such, the Company utilizes the appropriate incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate incurred to borrow on a collateralized basis over a term similar to the term of the lease for which the rate is estimated. Certain adjustments to the right-of-use asset may be required for items such as initial direct costs paid or incentives received. The Company leases office and research space in Rockville, Maryland under an operating lease that is subject to annual rent increases (the Lease). The Company paid a security deposit of to be held until the expiration or termination of the Company s obligations under the Lease. In April 2023, the Company and its landlord entered into an amendment to the Lease (the Lease Amendment). Pursuant to the Lease Amendment, the Company and the landlord agreed that the lease term for a portion of the premises, consisting of approximately square feet, would be extended from November 1, 2023 to January 31, 2025. However, pursuant to the restructuring plan adopted in the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company abandoned the leased space and determined that its right-of-use-asset was fully impaired. As a result, the Company recognized an impairment charge of million, representing the carrying value of the right-of-use asset. The Company s lease of the remaining premises, consisting of approximately square feet, expired on October 31, 2023. There were additional operating leases entered into during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The components of lease expense and related cash flows were as follows: Variable lease cost Total operating lease cost Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities: Operating cash outflows for operating leases Maturities of lease liability due under these lease agreements as of September 30, 2024 were as follows: 2025 Thereafter Total Present value adjustment ) Present value of lease payments

Stock options generally terminate from the date of grant. Authorized Shares The maximum number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the 2013 Plan was originally shares, plus any shares subject to stock options or similar awards granted under the 2003 Plan that expire or terminate without having been exercised in full or are forfeited to or repurchased by the Company.

Shares subject to stock awards granted under the 2013 Plan that expire or terminate without being exercised in full, or that are paid out in cash rather than in shares, will not reduce the number of shares available for issuance under the 2013 Plan. Additionally, shares issued pursuant to stock awards under the 2013 Plan that the Company repurchases or that are forfeited, as well as shares reacquired by the Company as consideration for the exercise or purchase price of a stock award or to satisfy tax withholding obligations related to a stock award, will become available for future grant under the 2013 Plan. A summary of the Company s stock option activity under the 2013 Plan for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is as follows: Options granted Options exercised ) Options forfeited ) Outstanding as of September 30, 2024 Vested or expected to vest as of September 30, 2024 Exercisable as of September 30, 2024 As of September 30, 2024, there was of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested options under the 2013 Plan that will be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.9 years.

Total intrinsic value of the options exercised during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was and total cash received for options exercised was . The total fair value of stock options which vested in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was and , respectively.

 Vested ) Forfeited ) Unvested at September 30, 2024 Issuance of Shares to Directors in Lieu of Cash Retainers for Service In March 2023, the Company s board of directors amended the Company s Non-Employee Director Compensation Policy to include an election to receive unrestricted shares of common stock in lieu of quarterly board and committee retainer cash payments. The number of shares to be issued to an electing director is determined on the last day of each fiscal quarter by dividing the dollar amount of the compensation to be paid for such quarter that is subject to the election by the closing price of a share of common stock on the last trading day of the fiscal quarter, rounded up to the nearest whole share. Non-employee directors who made such an election received shares of common stock in lieu of cash compensation earned for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. All shares of common stock issued pursuant to such an election are fully vested upon issuance and are classified as Other Awards under the 2013 Plan. In June 2024, the Non-Employee Director Compensation Policy was amended to allow a director to revoke his or her annual election to receive unrestricted shares of common stock in lieu of quarterly board and committee retainer cash payments. The decision to amend the policy followed a significant decline in the market value of the Company s common stock in May 2024. Without the ability of the directors to revoke the prior elections, the Company would have been obligated to issue a significantly greater number of shares than in prior quarters in lieu of the fixed cash retainer payments. Each of the directors who previously elected to receive unrestricted shares of common stock in lieu of quarterly board and committee retainer cash payments for 2024 revoked their elections in June 2024, and as a result there were additional shares issued under the policy for the three months ended June 30, 2024 or the three months ended September 30, 2024. Inducement Plan The Company s board of directors previously adopted the GlycoMimetics, Inc. Inducement Plan (as amended to date, the Inducement Plan). The Inducement Plan provides for the grant of nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock awards, RSU awards, stock appreciation rights and other forms of stock awards to individuals not previously an employee or director of the Company as an inducement for such individuals to join the Company. Unless otherwise stated in an applicable stock option agreement, one -fourth of the shares subject to an option grant under the Inducement Plan will typically vest upon the first anniversary of the vesting start date, with the balance of the shares vesting in a series of successive equal monthly installments as of the first day of each month measured from the first anniversary of the vesting start date, subject to the new employee s continued service with the Company through the applicable vesting dates. Upon termination of employment by reasons other than death, cause or disability, any vested options will terminate after the termination date, unless otherwise set forth in a stock option agreement. Stock options generally terminate from the date of grant. The Inducement Plan was amended by the board of directors on multiple occasions to increase the number of shares reserved for issuance to shares as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, there were shares available for future grants under the Inducement Plan.

The words or phrases would be, will allow, intends to, will likely result, are expected to, will continue, is anticipated, estimate, project, or similar expressions, or the negative of such words or phrases, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events. Because such statements include risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those below and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I Item 1A, Risk Factors, and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Statements made herein are as of the date of the filing of this Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission and should not be relied upon as of any subsequent date. Unless otherwise required by applicable law, we do not undertake, and we specifically disclaim, any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect occurrences, developments, unanticipated events or circumstances after the date of such statement. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited financial statements and related notes that appear in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our audited financial statements and related notes for the year ended December 31, 2023, which are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 27, 2024. Overview and Recent Developments We are a biotechnology company that was previously developing a pipeline of proprietary glycomimetics, which are small molecules that mimic the structure of carbohydrates involved in important biological processes, to inhibit disease-related functions of carbohydrates such as the roles they play in cancers and inflammation. Our glycomimetic drug candidate, uproleselan, is a specific E-selectin antagonist that we were developing to be used in combination with chemotherapy to treat patients with acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, a life-threatening hematologic cancer, and potentially other hematologic cancers. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 pivotal clinical trial to evaluate uproleselan in individuals with relapsed/refractory (R/R) AML. In May 2024, we reported topline results from the Phase 3 trial, in which uproleselan combined with chemotherapy did not achieve a statistically significant improvement in overall survival in the intent to treat (ITT) population versus chemotherapy alone. In June 2024, we announced comprehensive results of the Phase 3 trial. Following the announcement of the data from the Phase 3 trial, we requested and held a meeting with the FDA to discuss whether any of the results summarized above could serve as a basis for a submission for regulatory approval. Based on the feedback received, we concluded that any potential regulatory path for uproleselan in this patient population would require an additional clinical trial, the conduct of which would require capital resources beyond those available to us. The decision to not conduct an additional clinical trial did not relate to any safety or medical issues or negative regulatory feedback related to our programs. In July 2024, following the announcement of the data from our Phase 3 pivotal trial and our discussions with the FDA, we announced that we would initiate a review of strategic alternatives focused on maximizing stockholder value, which could include, but are not limited to, a merger, sale, divestiture of assets, licensing, or other strategic transaction. We also reduced our workforce by approximately 80 in order to conserve our cash resources as part of a streamlined operating plan while we undertook our strategic review. We also have entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement, or CRADA, with the National Cancer Institute, or NCI, part of the National Institutes of Health, to conduct a Phase 2/3 randomized, controlled clinical trial testing the addition of uproleselan to a standard chemotherapy regimen. On October 29, 2024 we announced data from the Phase 2 portion of the trial of uproleselan being conducted by the NCI and the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology in adults with newly diagnosed AML who are 60 years or older and fit for intensive chemotherapy. This study

 did not show a statistically significant improvement in event free survival (EFS) for patients receiving uproleselan in combination with 7+3 chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone. In addition to uproleselan, we designed an innovative antagonist of E-selectin, GMI-1687, that could be a subcutaneously administered treatment. Initially developed as a potential life-cycle extension to uproleselan GMI-1687 was being developed to broaden the clinical usefulness of an E-selectin antagonist to conditions where outpatient treatment is preferred or required. We conducted a Phase 1a trial of GMI-1687 in healthy adult volunteers and have entered into a collaboration with Apollomics (Hong Kong) Limited for the development of GMI-1687, as well as uproleselan, in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, also known as Greater China, but we are not otherwise actively developing GMI-1687. Following the strategic review described above, on October 28, 2024 we entered into acquisition agreement, or the Merger Agreement, with Crescent Biopharma, Inc., or Crescent, a privately held biotechnology company advancing a pipeline of oncology therapeutics designed to treat solid tumors, pursuant to which Crescent will become a wholly owned subsidiary of us and we will operate under the name Crescent Biopharma, Inc. following such transaction, or the Merger. We anticipate that the Merger will close in the second quarter of 2025, subject to certain closing conditions, along with a concurrent private placement financing. For additional information about the Merger and the concurrent private placement financing, see Note 1 to the financial statements included in this report, as well as the Current Report on Form 8-K that we filed with the SEC on October 29, 2024. Following the Merger, the current business of Crescent will become the primary business of our company. Based on our current operating plan, we expect that our current cash and cash equivalents will fund our operations until the closing of the Merger; however, we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we expect. If we are unable to close the Merger or raise additional capital, we will need to eliminate some or all of our operations or liquidate our company. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the balance sheets and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. In accordance with GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made. Actual results may materially differ from our estimates and judgments under different assumptions or conditions. We periodically review our estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates are reflected in our financial statements prospectively from the date of the change in estimate. We define our critical accounting policies as those accounting principles generally accepted in the United States that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles. For a description of our critical accounting policies and estimates, please see the disclosures in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have not been any material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates since December 31, 2023. Components of Operating Results Revenue We have not generated any revenue from the sale of our drug candidates and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of drugs in the near future. Substantially all of our historical revenue consisted of upfront and milestone payments under license and collaboration agreements.

 Research and Development Research and development expenses have consisted of expenses incurred in performing research and development activities, including compensation and benefits for full-time research and development employees, facilities expenses, overhead expenses, cost of laboratory supplies, clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing expenses, fees paid to CROs and other consultants and other outside expenses. Other preclinical research and platform programs have included activities related to exploratory efforts, target validation, lead optimization for our earlier programs and our proprietary glycomimetics platform. We have not utilized a formal time allocation system to capture expenses on a project-by-project basis because we were organized and recorded expense by functional department and our employees allocated time to more than one development project. Accordingly, we have only allocated a portion of our research and development expenses by functional area and by drug candidate. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Non-refundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities were deferred and capitalized. The capitalized amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed. Should we resume development of our product candidates, the duration, costs and timing of clinical trials and development of our drug candidates would depend on a variety of factors that include: 
 per patient trial costs; the number of patients that participate in the trials; the number of sites included in the trials; the countries in which the trial is conducted; the length of time required to enroll eligible patients; the number of doses that patients receive; the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients; potential additional safety monitoring or other studies requested by regulatory agencies; the duration of patient follow-up; and the safety and efficacy profile of the drug candidate. In addition, the probability of success for each drug candidate will depend on numerous factors, including competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. We will determine which programs to pursue and how much to fund each program in response to the scientific and clinical success of each drug candidate, as well as an assessment of each drug candidate s commercial potential. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses have consisted primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance, accounting, business development and human resources functions. Other significant costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, legal fees relating to patent and corporate matters and fees for accounting and consulting services. Interest Income Interest income consists of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents.

During 2023, we accrued amounts for the expected payments of year-end bonuses to employees; as no bonuses will be payable for the year ending December 31, 2024, we have not recorded any further accruals and reversed accruals made through April, 2024. General and Administrative Expense The following tables summarize the components of our general and administrative expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Increase/(Decrease) (dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Personnel-related 1,290 1,682 (392) (23) Stock-based compensation 855 677 178 26 Legal, consulting and other professional expenses 1,669 1,918 (249) (13) Other 192 245 (53) (22) General and administrative expense 4,006 4,522 (516) (11) Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase/(Decrease) (dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Personnel-related 4,135 5,385 (1,250) (23) Stock-based compensation 2,571 1,938 633 33 Legal, consulting and other professional expenses 5,811 6,763 (952) (14) Other 651 815 (164) (20) General and administrative expense 13,168 14,901 (1,733) (12) General and administrative expenses decreased by 0.5 million and 1.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively as compared to the same periods in 2023. These decreases were primarily due to lower personnel-related expenses, including no bonus accruals for 2024. Professional expenses also decreased as a result of lower levels of commercial consulting services in 2024 compared to 2023. These decreases were offset by higher stock-based compensation expenses incurred 2024 as compared to 2023 due to a higher fair market value for shares issued in 2024 as compared to 2023 and company-wide retention grants of stock options in June 2024.

 Gain on Sale of Asset During the three months ended September 30, 2024, as part of our streamlining our operations, we sold the rights to rivipansel for proceeds of 1.2 million. As we had previously written down this asset to zero value in our financial statements, we recorded a gain on sale of asset equal to the net proceeds. Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we undertook a reduction in force of our headcount and incurrent 5.0 million of severance and related expenses. We also abandoned our leased office space and recorded 0.4 million of impairment charges related to the lease and accelerated depreciation on property and equipment. Interest Income During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest income decreased by 0.4 million and 1.0 million, respectively, due to lower invested cash and cash equivalent balances as compared to the same periods in 2023. Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources of Liquidity We historically financed our operations primarily through public offerings and private placements of our capital stock, including at-the-market equity sales agreements and upfront and milestone payments from our license and collaboration agreements. As of September 30, 2024, we had 14.4 million in cash and cash equivalents. In March 2022, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, which was declared effective on April 22, 2022. In April 2022, we entered into an at-the-market sales agreement, or the 2022 Sales Agreement, with Cowen and Company. Under the 2022 Sales Agreement, we may sell up to 100.0 million in shares of our common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we sold 1,953,854 shares of common stock under the 2022 Sales Agreement at a weighted average price of 2.22 per share, for aggregate net proceeds of 4.2 million, after deducting commissions and offering expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we sold 9,822,930 shares of common stock under the 2022 Sales Agreement at a weighted average price of 3.01 per share, for aggregate net proceeds of 28.7 million, after deducting commissions and offering expenses. There were no shares sold in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, 66.0 million remained available to be sold under the 2022 Sales Agreement, although we have no current plans to sell additional shares under the 2022 Sales Agreement prior to the closing of the Merger. We entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Apollomics in 2020 and are potentially eligible to earn milestone payments and royalties under that agreement. However, our ability to earn milestone payments and potential royalty payments and their timing will be dependent upon the outcome of Apollomics activities and is therefore uncertain. Funding Requirements Our primary uses of capital were historically compensation and related expenses, third-party clinical research and development services, clinical costs, legal and other regulatory expenses and general overhead costs. Now that we have suspended all of our research and development activities in anticipation of entering into the Merger with Crescent, our operations will be limited and we expect that our expenses will decrease significantly. As of September 30, 2024, our only contractual obligations consisted of the remaining rent obligation of 268,000 under a non-cancelable lease for office space with a term through January 2025. We have no other fixed long-term obligations and do not have significant capital expenditure requirements.

 Going Concern The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The Company incurred a net loss of 30.7 million and had net cash flows used in operating activities of 27.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, the Company had 14.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and had no committed source of additional funding from either debt or equity financings. Management believes that given the Company s current cash position and forecasted negative cash flows from operating activities over the next twelve months, there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern after the date that is one year from the date that these unaudited financial statements are issued. The Company expects that its current cash resources will only be sufficient to fund the Company s operations through the closing of the contemplated Merger and Private Placement. Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities (27,397) (27,265) Investing activities (10) (21) Financing activities 5 28,823 Net change in cash and cash equivalents (27,402) 1,537 Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was primarily the result of pre-commercialization efforts and clinical and manufacturing costs associated with our uproleselan clinical development programs. These cash expenses were offset by non-cash expenses for stock-based compensation, lease expense and depreciation. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was for computer, office and laboratory equipment and was not material. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of proceeds received from stock option exercises. Net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily consisted of the net proceeds received from sales of our common stock under the 2022 Sales Agreement of 28.7 million. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATI VE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item. ITEM 4. CONT ROLS AND PROCEDURES (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, refers to controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 

 25 

Table of Contents 
 Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to a company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date at the reasonable assurance level. (b) Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting There have not been any changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during our fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDING S From time to time, we are subject to litigation and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings and we are not aware of any pending or threatened legal proceeding against us that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTOR S Our business is subject to risks and events that, if they occur, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our securities. Except as set forth below, our risk factors as of the date of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q have not changed materially from those described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 27, 2024, as supplemented by Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024, filed with the SEC on May 9, 2024 and August 8, 2024, respectively. Risks Related to Our Proposed Merger with Crescent Our stockholders will experience significant dilution as a consequence of the Merger and related transactions. The ownership of current stockholders of our company is expected to decrease from 100 of our common stock to approximately 3 of the combined company following the Merger and related private placement financing. This reduced ownership interest in the combined company will significantly reduce the influence that our current stockholders will have on the management of the combined company.

Table of Contents 
 We may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the Merger and may be exposed to other operational and financial risks. The negotiation and consummation of our proposed Merger with Crescent will require significant time on the part of our management, and the diversion of management s attention may disrupt our business. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger are highly uncertain. Any anticipated benefits will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to integrate our business with that of Crescent and our ability to generate future value for the stockholders of the combined company. The expected benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. The negotiation and consummation of any such transaction may also require more time or greater cash resources than we anticipate and expose us to other operational and financial risks, including: increased near-term and long-term expenditures; exposure to unknown liabilities; higher than expected acquisition or integration costs; incurrence of substantial debt or dilutive issuances of equity securities to fund future operations; write-downs of assets or goodwill or incurrence of non-recurring, impairment or other charges; increased amortization expenses; difficulty and cost in combining Crescent s operations with ours; impairment of relationships with key suppliers or customers due to changes in management and ownership; inability to retain employees; and possibility of future litigation. 
 If we are unable to consummate the Merger with Crescent, our board of directors may decide to pursue a dissolution and liquidation. In such an event, the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders will depend heavily on the timing of such liquidation as well as the amount of cash that will need to be reserved for commitments and contingent liabilities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to complete the proposed Merger with Crescent. If the Merger is not completed, our board of directors may decide to pursue a dissolution and liquidation. In such an event, the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders will depend heavily on the timing of such decision and, with the passage of time the amount of cash available for distribution will be reduced as we continue to fund our operations. In addition, if our board of directors were to approve and recommend, and our stockholders were to approve, a dissolution and liquidation, we would be required under Delaware corporate law to pay our outstanding obligations, as well as to make reasonable provision for contingent and unknown obligations, prior to making any distributions in liquidation to our stockholders. As a result of this requirement, a portion of our assets may need to be reserved pending the resolution of such obligations and the timing of any such resolution is uncertain. In addition, we may be subject to litigation or other claims related to a dissolution and liquidation. If a dissolution and liquidation were pursued, our board of directors, in consultation with our advisors, would need to evaluate these matters and make a determination about a reasonable amount to reserve. Accordingly, holders of our common stock could lose all or a significant portion of their investment in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up. We may become involved in litigation, including securities class action litigation, that could divert management s attention and harm our business, and insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all costs and damages. In the past, litigation, including securities class action litigation, has often followed certain significant business transactions, such as the sale of a company or announcement of any other strategic transaction, or the announcement of negative events, such as negative results from clinical trials. These events may also result in investigations by the SEC. We may be exposed to such litigation, even if no wrongdoing occurred. Litigation is usually expensive and diverts

 management s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business and cash resources and our ability to consummate the Merger with Crescent. Risks Related to an Investment in Our Common Stock If we fail to comply or regain compliance with Nasdaq s continued listing standards, prior to the consummation of the Merger, our common stock may be delisted and the price of our common stock, our ability to access the capital markets and our financial condition could be negatively impacted. Our common stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Global Market. To maintain the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market, we are required to meet certain listing requirements, including, among others, either: (i) a minimum closing bid price of 1.00 per share, a market value of publicly held shares (excluding shares held by our executive officers, directors and 10 or more stockholders) of at least 5 million and stockholders equity of at least 10 million; or (ii) a minimum closing bid price of 1.00 per share, a market value of publicly held shares (excluding shares held by our executive officers, directors, affiliates and 10 or more stockholders) of at least 15 million and a total market value of listed securities of at least 50 million. In June 2024, we received a written notice, or the Notice, from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market, or Nasdaq, that we are not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Market. Pursuant to Nasdaq listing rules, we have been provided an initial compliance period of 180 calendar days from receipt of the Notice, or until December 18, 2024, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. To regain compliance, the bid price for our common stock would need to close at 1.00 per share or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days during this 180-day grace period, among other requirements. While we may be able to qualify for additional time to attempt to regain compliance, which could include a transfer of our listing from the Nasdaq Global Market to the Nasdaq Capital Market, there can be no assurance that we will qualify for additional time to regain compliance, or that we will regain compliance with or without such additional time. If necessary to regain compliance with Nasdaq listing standards, we may, subject to approval of our board of directors and stockholders, implement a reverse stock split. However, there can be no assurance that a reverse stock split, or any other alternatives we may consider to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, would be approved or would result in a sustained higher stock price that would allow us to meet the Nasdaq stock price listing requirements. Separately, Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b)(1) requires companies listed on the Nasdaq Global Market to maintain a stockholders equity of at least 10 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had stockholders equity of 11.4 million. If we were to transfer our listing to the Nasdaq Capital Market, we would need to maintain a minimum stockholders equity of 2.5 million or meet certain alternative requirements. As a result of our expected decrease in stockholders equity due to continued net losses, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the minimum required stockholders equity under the Nasdaq continued listing standards. If we are not able to maintain compliance within the compliance periods allotted by Nasdaq, our common stock could be delisted, which would have a further material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and on stockholder liquidity. We intend to actively monitor the bid price of our common stock and will consider available options to regain compliance with the listing requirement; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance with the listing requirement or will otherwise be in compliance with the other Nasdaq listing criteria. If Nasdaq delists our common stock for failure to meet its listing standards, and our common stock is not eligible for quotation or listing on another market or exchange, we and our stockholders could face significant negative consequences, including: trading of our common stock being conducted only in the over-the-counter market or on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities, such as the Pink Sheets or the OTC Bulletin Board, which could result in limited availability of market quotations for our common stock and increased difficulty of disposing of shares of common stock;

 a determination that the common stock is a penny stock, which would require brokers trading in the common stock to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for shares of our common stock; a limited amount of analyst coverage; and a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. 
 ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS None. ITEM 5.

Exhibit 10.1 Execution Version August 7, 2024 Harout Semerjian RE: RETENTION AGREEMENT AND OFFER OF REVISED SEVERANCE ELIGIBILITY Dear Harout: Thank you for all of your contributions to GlycoMimetics, Inc. (the Company ). Your role is critical to the next phase of the Company. Our hope is that, despite the fact that you may have other employment opportunities, you will remain employed with the Company until the Company concludes that your position is no longer required. To financially incentivize you to remain employed by the Company for this period (which we expect may be several months), we are pleased to offer you a retention bonus and enhanced severance eligibility, as summarized below. Retention Bonus If you remain employed by the Company through December 31, 2024 (the Earn Date ), and provided you have not tendered your resignation before such date and the Company has not terminated your employment for Cause (as defined in your Executive Employment Agreement, dated as of August 3, 2021 (the Employment Agreement )) before the Earn Date, then, you will be eligible to receive, as a retention bonus, an amount equal to your 2024 Target Bonus (the Retention Bonus ). If earned, the Retention Bonus will be paid on the next regularly scheduled payroll date after the Earn Date in a lump sum and will be subject to applicable payroll withholdings and deductions. For avoidance of doubt, if you remain employed through the date that 2024 bonuses would ordinarily paid (in early 2025), and have already received the Retention Bonus, you will not be eligible to receive a 2024 Target Bonus, but you will be eligible to receive a prorated target bonus for 2025 based on the number of months you are employed in 2025. Additional Severance Benefits Additionally, if you remain employed by the Company through the date the Company notifies you that your position is no longer required (the Anticipated Separation Date ), and provided you have not tendered your resignation before such date and the Company has not terminated your employment for Cause before that date, then, in addition to the severance benefits provided in your Employment Agreement, you will be eligible to receive the additional severance benefits listed below (the Additional Severance Benefits ): A waiver of the non-competition and non-solicitation provisions of your Confidentiality Agreement (as defined below). In the event that your separation date occurs before Earn Date, (and you have not received the Retention Bonus), then you will receive as an Additional Severance Benefit, an amount equal to the Retention Bonus. In the event your separation date occurs after the Earn Date (and you have already received the Retention Bonus), you will not receive any further severance in respect of that amount. In the event that on or within three (3) months immediately following your separation date, the Company has signed a definitive agreement (other than a term sheet or letter of intent) that results in a Change in Control (as defined in the Employment Agreement) 

within twelve (12) months after the separation date, then any severance benefits you are receiving (or have received as of such date) shall be increased such that you will receive the same amount of severance benefits you would have been eligible to receive upon a Change in Control Termination, as described in Section 9.3 of the Employment Agreement . For avoidance of doubt, (i) any incremental payment under this bullet will equal .5x the 2024 Target Bonus, and (ii) a dissolution of the Company would not trigger any enhanced Change in Control severance payments as described in this bullet. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in your Employment Agreement, your severance (including any enhanced severance due to a Change in Control as described in the bullet above) will be paid in a lump sum, but solely to the extent that payment in a lump sum would not result in adverse tax consequences under Code Section 409A. Any enhanced severance you are eligible to receive due to a Change in Control described in the above bullet will be paid at the time of the closing of the Change in Control. To receive the Additional Severance Benefits, you will be required to timely execute and allow to become effective the Company s standard separation agreement which will provide the details of each of the Additional Severance Benefits. This letter is intended to provide a financial incentive to you and is not intended to confer any rights to continued employment upon you. Nothing in this letter is intended to alter your at-will employment relationship, and except as otherwise modified herein with respect to severance eligibility, all other provisions of the Employment Agreement and your Employee Confidential Information, Inventions, Non-Solicitation and Non-Competition Agreement (the Confidentiality Agreement remain in full force and effect. All questions concerning the construction, validity and interpretation of this letter will be governed by the laws of the State of Maryland. This letter is the complete, final and exclusive embodiment of the entire agreement between you and the Company with regard to the benefits provided for herein, and it supersedes and replaces any other agreements (whether written or unwritten) you may have with the Company concerning these matters (other than the Employment Agreement and Confidentiality Agreement which remain in full force and effect). The terms of this letter may not be modified or amended except in a written agreement signed by you and a duly authorized officer of the Company. If you would like to accept the Company s offer of the Retention Bonus and additional severance eligibility, please sign below and return to me on or before August 7, 2024. Sincerely, /s/ Timothy R. Pearson Timothy R. Pearson Chair of Compensation Committee and Chair of the Board of Directors Accepted and Agreed: /s/ Harout Semerjian Date: August 7, 2024 Harout Semerjian

If you are a Washington employee, nothing in this Agreement prevents you from discussing or disclosing: 1) conduct that you reasonably believe to be illegal discrimination, illegal harassment, illegal retaliation, sexual assault, or a wage and hour violation; 2) conduct that is recognized as against a clear mandate of public policy; or 3) the existence of a settlement involving any of the above conduct, provided, however , that the amount of such a settlement can still be subject to non-disclosure obligations, as can any trade secrets, proprietary information, or confidential information that does not involve illegal acts. 16. Your Acknowledgments and Affirmations. You acknowledge and agree that (i) the consideration given to you in exchange for the waiver and release in this Agreement is in addition to anything of value to which you were already entitled; and (ii) that you have been paid for all time worked, have received all the leave, leaves of absence and leave benefits and protections for which you are eligible, and have not suffered any on-the-job injury for which you have not already filed a claim. You affirm that all of the decisions of the Company Parties regarding your pay and benefits through the date of your execution of this Agreement were not discriminatory based on age, disability, race, color, sex, religion, national origin or any other classification protected by law. You affirm that you will not voluntarily (except in response to legal compulsion or as permitted in Section 15 above) assist any person in bringing or pursuing any proposed or pending litigation, arbitration, administrative claim or other formal proceeding against any of the Company Parties. You further affirm that you have no known workplace injuries or occupational diseases. You acknowledge and affirm that you have not been retaliated against for reporting any allegation of corporate fraud or other wrongdoing by any of the Company Parties, or for exercising any rights protected by law, including any rights protected by the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Family Medical Leave Act, or any related statute or local leave or disability accommodation laws, or any applicable state workers compensation law. 17. No Admission. This Agreement does not constitute an admission by the Company of any wrongful action or violation of any federal, state, or local statute, or common 

 law rights, including those relating to the provisions of any law or statute concerning employment actions, or of any other possible or claimed violation of law or rights. 18. Breach. You agree that upon any breach of this Agreement you will forfeit all amounts paid or owing to you under this Agreement. Further, you acknowledge that it may be impossible to assess the damages caused by your violation of the terms of Sections 9, 10, 11, and 12 of this Agreement and further agree that any threatened or actual violation or breach of those Sections of this Agreement will constitute immediate and irreparable injury to the Company. You therefore agree that any such breach of this Agreement is a material breach of this Agreement, and, in addition to any and all other damages and remedies available to the Company upon your breach of this Agreement, the Company shall be entitled to an injunction to prevent you from violating or breaching this Agreement. You agree that if the Company is successful in whole or part in any legal or equitable action against you under this Agreement, you agree to pay all of the costs, including reasonable attorneys fees, incurred by the Company in enforcing the terms of this Agreement. 19. Miscellaneous. This Agreement, including Exhibits A and B, constitutes the complete, final and exclusive embodiment of the entire agreement between you and the Company with regard to this subject matter. It is entered into without reliance on any promise or representation, written or oral, other than those expressly contained herein, and it supersedes any other such promises, warranties or representations. This Agreement may not be modified or amended except in a writing signed by both you and a duly authorized officer of the Company. This Agreement will bind the heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns of both you and the Company, and inure to the benefit of both you and the Company, their heirs, successors and assigns. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, this determination will not affect any other provision of this Agreement and the provision in question will be modified by the court so as to be rendered enforceable. This Agreement will be deemed to have been entered into and will be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the state or commonwealth in which you primarily performed work for the Company as applied to contracts made and to be performed entirely within such state or commonwealth. If this Agreement is acceptable to you, please sign below and return it to me on or before the date that is forty-five (45) days after you receive this Agreement (but no earlier than the Separation Date). The Company s severance offer contained herein will automatically expire if you do not sign and return the fully signed Agreement within this timeframe. I wish you good luck in your future endeavors.

In addition, Consultant may disclose Client s Confidential Information in response to a valid order by a court or other governmental body, as otherwise required by law. All Confidential Information furnished to Consultant by Client is the sole and exclusive property of Client or its suppliers or customers. Upon request by Client, Consultant agrees to promptly deliver to Client the original and any copies of such Confidential Information. Consultant s duty of confidentiality under this Agreement does not amend or abrogate in any manner Consultant s continuing duties under any prior agreement between Consultant and Client. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other agreement between Client and Consultant, nothing in this Agreement shall limit Consultant s right to discuss Consultant s engagement with the Client or report possible violations of law or regulation with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the United States Department of Labor, the National Labor Relations Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or other federal government agency or similar state or local agency or to discuss the terms and conditions of Consultant s engagement with others to the extent expressly permitted by applicable provisions of law or regulation, including but not limited to whistleblower statutes or other similar provisions that protect such disclosure. Further, notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 1833(b), Consultant shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any Federal or State trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that: (1) is made in confidence to a Federal, State, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney, and solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (2) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. Consultant s duty of confidentiality under this Agreement does not amend or abrogate in any manner Consultant s continuing duties under any prior agreement between Consultant and the Client. 14. Term and Termination. 14.1 Term. The term of this Agreement and the Consulting Period is from the Effective Date set forth above and for six (6) months thereafter, unless earlier terminated as provided in this Agreement, or extended by the parties by written agreement. 14.2 Termination.

 (b) Termination upon Material Breach . The Client may terminate this Agreement before its expiration immediately if, Consultant materially breaches the Agreement. The parties agree that a Material Breach by Consultant shall occur if he: (i) breaches any material obligations of this Agreement, the Separation Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement, or (ii) violates local, state, or federal laws. For avoidance of doubt, it shall not constitute a material breach if Consultant becomes employed or otherwise provides services to or on behalf of an entity other than the Client during the Consulting Period so long as any such activity does not conflict with Consultant s continuing obligations to Client under the Confidentiality Agreement or the Separation Agreement. 14.3 Effect of Termination. Upon any termination or expiration of this Agreement, Consultant (i) shall immediately discontinue all use of Client s Confidential Information delivered under this Agreement; (ii) shall delete any such Client Confidential Information from Consultant s computer storage or any other media, including, but not limited to, online and off-line libraries; and (iii) shall return to Client, or, at Client s option, destroy, all copies of such Confidential Information then in Consultant s possession.
