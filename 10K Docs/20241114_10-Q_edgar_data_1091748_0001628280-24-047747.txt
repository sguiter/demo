 million bargain purchase, which is uncommon, since the value of the net assets acquired exceeded the purchase consideration. The values of certain assets and liabilities are considered preliminary in nature and are subject to adjustment during the measurement period as additional information is obtained. As the valuations are finalized, any changes to the preliminary valuation of assets acquired or liabilities assumed may result in retrospective adjustments to the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reduced its bargain purchase amount by million to million, resulting in a reduction to Additional paid-in capital . The adjustment related to the Company s valuation of loss reserves for its U.S. Operations.

 On June 2, 2024, the Company entered into a commutation with Riverstone Holdings Limited (part of the RiverStone International group) on its legacy assumed business from our former Malta operations, ArgoGlobal Holdings (Malta) Ltd., which was sold in 2022. This transaction had no material impact on our net income. The final consideration of million was paid to Riverstone Holdings Limited on July 1, 2024.

 On February 2, 2023, the Seller completed the sale of the entire issued share capital of AUA.

 As a result of the sale, we realized a loss of million in the first quarter of 2023, which is included as a component of Net realized investment and other gains (losses) in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). This loss is due to the realization of unrealized investment losses, which were previously a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.

 Our gross deferred tax assets are supported by taxes paid in previous periods, reversal of taxable temporary differences and recognition of future taxable income. Management regularly evaluates the recoverability of the deferred tax assets and makes any necessary adjustments to them based upon any changes in management s expectations of future taxable income. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generation of future taxable income sufficient to recover tax benefits that cannot be recovered from taxes paid in the carryback period, generally for our U.S. property and casualty insurers for net operating losses and for all our U.S. subsidiaries for capital losses. If a company determines that any of its deferred tax assets will not result in future tax benefits, a valuation allowance must be established for the portion of these assets that are not expected to be realized. For three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the net change in valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was an increase of million and decrease of million, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the change in valuation allowance related to the limited net operating loss carryforwards incurred in the United Kingdom. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the change in valuation allowance primarily related to the following: million decrease related to an Ireland Capital Loss due to dissolution and a million increase related to limited net operating loss carryforwards incurred in the United Kingdom. Based upon a review of our available evidence, both positive and negative discussed above, the Company concluded that it is more-likely-than-not that million of our deferred tax assets will be realized.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, and a discussion of our financial condition as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the attached unaudited interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto and Argo Group s 2023 Form 10-K, including the audited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto. 
 On November 16, 2023, we merged with Brookfield Wealth Solutions Ltd. (formerly known as Brookfield Reinsurance Ltd.) (the Merger ), which resulted in a change to the Company s ownership. Brookfield Wealth Solutions Ltd. elected to push-down its purchase accounting, which resulted in the Company reflecting the fair market value of our assets and liabilities as of November 16, 2023, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC 805, Business Combinations. The application of push-down accounting created a new basis of accounting for all of our assets and liabilities. As such, the Company s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows subsequent to the Merger are not comparable with those prior to November 16, 2023, and therefore have been separated to indicate pre-Merger and post-Merger periods. The pre-Merger period through November 15, 2023 is referred to as the Predecessor. The post-Merger period, November 16, 2023 and forward, includes the impact of push-down accounting and is referred to as the Successor. 
 Certain reclassifications have been made to financial information presented for prior years to conform to the current year s presentation.

 In determining appropriate reserve levels for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we maintained the same general processes and disciplines that were used to set reserves at prior reporting dates. No significant changes in methodologies were made to estimate the reserves since the last reporting date; however, at each reporting date we reassess the actuarial estimate of the reserve for loss and loss adjustment expenses and record our best estimate. Consistent with prior reserve valuations, as claims data becomes more mature for prior accident years, actuarial estimates were refined to weigh certain actuarial methods more heavily in order to respond to any emerging trends in the paid and reported loss data. Pricing, reinsurance costs, legal environment, general economic conditions including changes in inflation and many other factors impact our ultimate loss estimates. Refer to segment results for specific factors impacting our current accident year loss ratios. 
 Gross reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses were 5,792.9 million and 5,544.5 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 Income Tax Provision (Benefit) 
 The income tax provision represents the income tax expense or benefit associated with our operations based on the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Therefore, the provision for income taxes represents taxes on net income for our United States, United Kingdom, Ireland, and Italy operations. The Company recorded an income tax benefit of 34.4 million and 27.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. This is compared to the income tax provision of 17.6 million and 3.3 million for the same period ended 2023. 
 The effective tax rate was 20.6 and 22.5 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the effective tax rate of (60.1) and (4.4) for the same periods ended 2023. For the period ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred an estimated Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax liability BEAT in connection with a reinsurance agreement between our U.S. and Bermuda operations which increased the current period effective tax rate. For the three and nine months ending September 30, 2024, the effective tax rates are aligned with statutory tax rates.

 Segment Results 
 We are primarily engaged in writing property and casualty insurance. We have two ongoing reporting segments: U.S. Operations and International Operations. Additionally, we have Run-off Lines for products that we no longer underwrite. 
 We consider many factors, including the nature of each segment s insurance products, production sources, distribution strategies and regulatory environment, in determining how to aggregate reporting segments. 
 Our reportable segments include four primary insurance services and offerings as follows: 
 Property includes both property insurance and reinsurance products. Insurance products cover commercial properties primarily in North America with some international covers. Reinsurance covers underlying exposures located throughout the world, including the United States. These offerings include coverages for man-made and natural disasters. 
 Liability includes a broad range of primary and excess casualty products primarily underwritten as insurance and, to a lesser extent reinsurance, for risks on both an admitted and non-admitted basis in the United States. Internationally, prior to the sale of AUA, Argo Group underwrote non-U.S. casualty risks primarily exposed in the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. 
 Professional includes various professional lines products including errors and omissions and management liability coverages (including directors and officers). 
 Specialty includes niche insurance coverages such as marine, accident and health, and surety product offerings. 
 In evaluating the operating performance of our segments, we focus on core underwriting and investing results before consideration of realized gains or losses from the sales of investments. Net investment and other gains (losses) are reported as a component of the Corporate and Other segment, as decisions regarding the acquisition and disposal of securities reside with the corporate investment function and are not under the control of the individual business segments. 
 Since we generally manage and monitor the investment portfolio on an aggregate basis, the overall performance of the investment portfolio, and related net investment income, is discussed above on a combined basis under net investment income rather than within or by segment.

 The table above includes underwriting income (loss) which is an internal performance measure that we use to measure our insurance profitability. We believe underwriting income (loss) enhances an investor s understanding of insurance operations profitability. Underwriting income (loss) is calculated as earned premiums less losses and loss adjustment expenses less underwriting, acquisition and general expenses. Although underwriting income (loss) does not replace net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of profitability, management uses underwriting income (loss) to focus our reporting segments on generating operating income.

 Run-off Lines include liabilities associated with other liability policies that were issued in the 1960s, 1970s and into the 1980s, as well as the former risk-management business and other business no longer underwritten. Through our subsidiary Argonaut Insurance Company Argonaut ), we are exposed to asbestos liability at the primary level through claims filed against our direct insureds, as well as through its position as a reinsurer of other primary carriers. Argonaut has direct liability arising primarily from policies issued from the 1960s to the early 1980s, which pre-dated policy contract wording that excluded asbestos exposure. The majority of the direct policies were issued on behalf of small contractors or construction companies. We believe that the frequency and severity of asbestos claims for such insureds is typically less than that experienced for large, industrial manufacturing and distribution concerns. 
 Argonaut also assumed risk as a reinsurer, primarily for the period from 1970 to 1975, a portion of which was assumed from the London market. Argonaut also reinsured risks on policies written by domestic carriers. Such reinsurance typically provides coverage for limits attaching at a relatively high level, which are payable only after other layers of reinsurance are exhausted. Some of the claims now being filed on policies reinsured by Argonaut are on behalf of claimants who may have been exposed at some time to asbestos incorporated into buildings they occupied but have no apparent medical problems resulting from such exposure. Additionally, lawsuits are being brought against businesses that were not directly involved in the manufacture or installation of materials containing asbestos. We believe that a significant portion of claims generated out of this population of claimants may result in incurred losses generally lower than the asbestos claims filed over the past decade and could be below the attachment level of Argonaut.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Cash Flows 
 The Company s future cash flows largely depend on the availability of dividends or other statutorily permissible payments from subsidiaries. The ability to pay such dividends is limited by the applicable laws and regulations of the various countries and states in which these subsidiaries operate, including, among others, Bermuda. 
 The primary sources of our cash inflows are premiums, reinsurance recoveries, proceeds from sales and redemptions of investments and investment income. The primary cash outflows are claim payments, loss adjustment expenses, reinsurance costs, underwriting, acquisition and overhead expenses, interest expense, purchases of investments, payment of preferred dividends and income taxes. Management believes that cash inflows are sufficient to cover cash outflows in the foreseeable future. We have access to additional sources of liquidity should the need for additional cash arise. 
 Cash provided by operating activities can fluctuate due to timing differences in the collection of premiums and reinsurance recoveries and the payment of losses and expenses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash used in operating activities was 83.6 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 271.5 million, respectively. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities in 2024 compared to 2023 was attributable to various fluctuations within our operating activities, and primarily related to the timing of reinsurance payments and recoveries, claim payments and premium cash receipts in the respective periods. The decrease in premium is a result of a strategic reassessment of our various lines of business. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 342.1 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of 322.1 million for the same period in 2023. Net cash used in investing activities in 2024 was mainly the result of purchases of short-term investments, private loan investments, mortgage loans, and other investments offset by net proceeds from fixed maturities investments. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was 192.1 million compared to 6.5 million net cash used in 2023. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2024 was driven by the issuance of our common shares to Brookfield Wealth Solutions Ltd. 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 On February 21, 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No. 6 Amendment No. 6 of the Credit Agreement with the financial institutions party thereto as lenders and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., individually as a lender and as administrative agent (the Credit Agreement ). Amendment No. 6, among other things, replaced the minimum Tangible Net Worth covenant in the Credit Agreement with a minimum Consolidated Net Worth. The Consolidated Net Worth covenant is tested at the end of each fiscal quarter and has been set at an amount equal to the sum of (i) 872.0 million plus (ii) 50 of positive net income for each fiscal quarter ending after December 31, 2023 plus (iii) 50 of net proceeds received from the issuance and sale of certain equity interests after December 31, 2023. 
 On February 22, 2024, the Company borrowed 100.0 million from the revolving credit facility and elected a one-month term and interest option, under the terms of the Credit Agreement. The loan had been renewed using the one-month option until May 29, 2024, when the Company repaid the 100.0 million borrowed under the revolving credit facility. The facility was subsequently terminated on June 4, 2024. On June 4, 2024, the Company was named as a party under Brookfield Wealth Solutions Ltd. s 1.2 billion revolving credit facility. 
 Letter of Credit Facilities 
 On September 30, 2024, letters of credit totaling 30.8 million were outstanding, of which 17.7 million were issued against the committed secured bilateral letter of credit facility and 13.1 million were issued against the uncommitted, secured bilateral letter of credit facility. Collateral with a market value of 40.0 million was pledged to these banks as security against these letters of credit.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 We believe that we are principally exposed to four types of market risk: interest rate risk, credit risk, equity price risk and foreign currency risk. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our primary market risk exposure on fixed maturity investments relates to interest rate risk and the changes in interest rates. Fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the fair value of these securities. As interest rates rise, the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio falls, and the converse is also true. We manage interest rate risk through an active portfolio management strategy that involves the selection of investments with appropriate characteristics such as duration, yield, currency and liquidity that are tailored to the anticipated cash outflow characteristics of our liabilities. A significant portion of our investment portfolio matures each year, allowing for reinvestment at current market rates. The model duration of the assets comprising our fixed maturity investment portfolio was 2.23 years and 2.68 years at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Credit Risk 
 We have exposure to credit risk on losses recoverable from reinsurers and receivables from insureds. Our controls to mitigate this risk include limiting our exposure to any one counterparty, evaluating the financial strength of our reinsurers, canceling policies, generally requiring minimum credit ratings and in certain cases receiving collateral from our reinsurers and insureds. 
 We also have exposure to credit risk in our investment holdings. Our risk management strategy and investment policy attempts to mitigate this risk by primarily investing in debt instruments of high credit quality issuers, limiting credit concentration, monitoring the credit quality of issuers and counterparties and diversifying issuers. The weighted average rating of our fixed maturity investments was A with 96.9 and A with 94.0 rated investment grade or better (BBB- or higher) at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 We review our investments to identify and evaluate those that may have credit impairments on a quarterly basis, considering the historical performance of the security, available market information, and credit ratings, among other things. For fixed maturity securities, the review includes consideration of current ratings and actions of major rating agencies (Standard Poor's, Moody's and Fitch). If a security has two ratings, the lower rating is used. If a security has three ratings, the middle rating is used. The following table reflects the credit quality of our fixed maturity portfolio at September 30, 2024:

Table of Contents 

 Other Fixed Maturities Cost Fair Value AAA 271.9 277.4 AA 95.0 97.7 A 493.5 509.5 BBB 643.9 665.0 BB/B 41.6 42.9 CCC and Below 9.9 9.7 Unrated Other Fixed Maturities 1,555.8 1,602.2 Structured Securities Cost Fair Value AAA 476.8 504.0 AA 92.6 97.8 A 107.7 111.7 BBB 30.0 31.2 BB/B 13.3 13.8 CCC and Below 7.4 7.5 Structured Securities 727.8 766.0 Total Fixed Maturities Cost Fair Value AAA 748.7 781.4 AA 187.6 195.5 A 601.2 621.2 BBB 673.9 696.2 BB/B 54.9 56.7 CCC and Below 17.3 17.2 Unrated Total Fixed Maturities 2,283.6 2,368.2 
 Our portfolio also includes alternative investments with a carrying value at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 of 430.3 million and 311.0 million (10.8 and 8.9 of total invested assets), respectively. We may invest in both long and short equities, corporate debt securities, currencies, real estate, commodities and derivatives. We attempt to mitigate our risk by selecting managers with extensive experience, proven track records and robust controls and processes. We also attempt to mitigate our risk by diversifying through multiple managers and different types of assets and asset classes. 
 Mortgage loans add portfolio diversification. These assets typically afford credit protections through covenants and deeper due diligence given information access. We also monitor debt service coverage ratios and loan-to-value ratios in our assessment of credit risk and exposure. 
 Equity Price Risk 
 We hold a diversified portfolio of equity securities with a fair value of 85.3 million and 10.7 million (2.1 and 0.3 of total invested assets) at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Our equity securities are exposed to equity price risk which is defined as the potential for loss in fair value due to a decline in equity prices. We believe the diversification of our equity securities among various industries, market segments and issuers, as well as the use of multiple outside investment managers, mitigates our exposure to equity price risk. 
 53 

Table of Contents 

 Foreign Currency Risk 
 We have exposure to foreign currency risk in our insurance contracts and invested assets and, prior to the sale of AUA, a portion of our debt. We attempt to manage our foreign currency risk by seeking to match our liabilities under insurance and reinsurance contracts that are payable in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar with cash and investments that are denominated in such currencies. We also use foreign exchange forward contracts to attempt to mitigate this risk. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized 0.0 million and 3.0 million of gross gains 1.7 million and 5.3 million of gross losses from foreign exchange contracts, for a net loss of 1.7 million and 2.3 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized 2.3 million and 11.1 million of gross gains and 3.8 million and 10.6 million of gross losses from foreign exchange contracts, for a net loss of 1.5 million and 0.5 million, respectively. The net losses are recorded in the Net investment and other gains (losses) in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). With the divestitures executed and announced in 2023, our exposure to foreign currency risk has decreased. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Argo Group, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024, at the reasonable assurance level to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Argo Group in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 
 Change in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting made during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 Throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, unless the context otherwise requires, references to Argo Group, we, us, our or the Company mean Argo Group International Holdings, Inc. and all of its subsidiaries, taken together as a whole. 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We and our subsidiaries are parties to legal actions from time to time, generally incidental to our and their business. While any litigation or arbitration proceedings include an element of uncertainty, management believes that the resolution of these matters will not materially affect our financial condition or results of operations. See Legal Actions in Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I of this Quarterly Report for additional information. 
 Federal Securities Class Action 
 The Police Fire Retirement System City of Detroit v. Argo Group International Holdings, Inc., et al., No. 22-cv-8971 (S.D.N.Y.) 
 On October 20, 2022, a securities class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company and certain of its current and former officers, alleging securities fraud violations under sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Plaintiff alleges that from February 13, 2018 through August 9, 2022, the defendants made false and misleading statements concerning the Company s reserves and underwriting standards. On January 18, 2023, U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan granted the Police and Fire Retirement System City of Detroit and the Oklahoma Law Enforcement Retirement System s joint motion for appointment as lead plaintiff. On March 27, 2023, lead plaintiffs filed an amended class action complaint. On May 26, 2023, the defendants moved to dismiss the amended class action complaint. On July 13, 2023, lead plaintiffs filed an opposition to such motion, after which defendants filed a reply on August 14, 2023.
