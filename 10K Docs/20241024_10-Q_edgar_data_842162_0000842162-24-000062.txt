ITEM 1 CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 INTRODUCTION TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 We have prepared the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Lear Corporation and subsidiaries pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. We believe that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading when read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 The financial information presented reflects all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) which are, in our opinion, necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations, cash flows and financial position for the interim periods presented. These results are not necessarily indicative of a full year's results of operations.

 In connection with this offer, the Company expects to recognize a non-cash settlement charge in the fourth quarter of 2024. The amount of the charge will depend on, among other factors, the number of plan participants who accept the offer.

 For further information related to our strategy, see Item 1, "Business," in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Industry Overview 
 Our sales are driven by the number of vehicles produced by the automotive manufacturers, which is ultimately dependent on consumer demand for automotive vehicles and the availability of raw materials and components, and our content per vehicle. 
 In 2020, the automotive industry experienced a significant decline in global production volumes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although 2023 industry production returned to pre-pandemic levels, 2024 industry production is expected to remain approximately 7 below 2017 peak levels (based on October 2024 S P Global Mobility projections). Since 2020, the global economy, as well as the automotive industry, has been influenced directly and indirectly by macroeconomic events resulting in unfavorable conditions, including shortages of semiconductor chips and other components, elevated inflation levels on commodities and labor , higher interest rates, and labor and energy shortages in certain markets. Certain of these factors, among others, continue to impact consumer demand, as well as the ability of automotive manufacturers to produce vehicles to meet demand. Our strategy to mitigate the impact of these factors encompasses our comprehensive cost management process, including cost technology optimization, actions to further align our manufacturing capacity to the current industry production environment and investments in automation technologies, as well as commercial recovery mechanisms. This will allow us to enhance operational efficiencies, improve the utilization of existing facilities and equipment to reduce future expenditures, and streamline administrative functions. For a description of related risks, see Item 1A, "Risk Factors," in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 (2) Production data for 2023 have been updated from our third quarter 2023 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to reflect actual production levels 
 Automotive sales and production can also be affected by the age of the vehicle fleet and related scrappage rates, labor relations issues, labor shortages, fuel prices, regulatory requirements, government initiatives, trade agreements, tariffs and other non-tariff trade barriers, the availability and cost of credit, the availability and cost of critical components, logistics issues, restructuring actions of our customers and suppliers, facility closures and increased competition, as well as consumer preferences regarding vehicle powertrains (including preferences regarding hybrid and electric vehicles), size, configuration and features, among other factors. Our operating results are also significantly impacted by the overall commercial success of the vehicle platforms for which we supply particular products, as well as the profitability of the products that we supply for these platforms, which is determined, in part, by the level of vertical integration. The loss of business with respect to any vehicle model for which we are a significant supplier, or a decrease in the production levels of any such models, could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, larger cars and light trucks, as well as vehicle platforms that offer more features and functionality, such as luxury, sport utility and crossover vehicles, typically have more content and, therefore, tend to have a more significant impact on our operating results. 
 Our percentage of consolidated net sales by region in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 is shown below:

 Our ability to reduce the risks inherent in certain concentrations of our business, and thereby maintain our financial performance in the future, will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to diversify our sales on a customer, product, platform and geographic basis to better reflect the market overall. 
 The automotive industry, and our business, continue to be shaped by the broad trend of electrification, which is likely to be at the forefront of the industry for the foreseeable future. Although the adoption of electrified vehicles has been slower than anticipated, demand for, and regulatory developments related to, improved energy efficiency and sustainability (e.g., government mandates related to fuel economy and carbon emissions) remain significant drivers of this trend. 
 Our material cost as a percentage of net sales was 64.2 in the first nine months of 2024, as compared to 65.5 in the first nine months of 2023. Raw material, energy, commodity and product component costs can be volatile, reflecting, among other things, changes in supply and demand, logistics issues, global trade and tariff policies, and geopolitical issues. Our primary commodity cost exposures relate to steel, copper and leather. We have developed and implemented strategies to mitigate the impact of such costs through the selective in-sourcing of components, the continued consolidation of our supply base, longer-term purchase commitments, commercial recovery mechanisms and the selective expansion of low-cost country sourcing and engineering, as well as value engineering and product benchmarking. Further, our exposure to changes in steel prices is primarily indirect, through purchased components, and a significant portion of our copper, leather and direct steel purchases are subject to price index agreements with our customers and suppliers. Certain of these strategies also may limit our opportunities in a declining price environment. In the current environment of elevated raw material, energy, commodity and product component costs, these strategies, together with commercial negotiations with our customers and suppliers, have offset a significant portion of the 
 34 

Table of Contents 
 LEAR CORPORATION 

 adverse impact. In addition, the availability of raw materials, energy, commodities and product components fluctuates from time to time due to factors outside of our control. If these costs increase or availability is restricted, it could have an adverse impact on our operating results in the foreseeable future. See " Forward-Looking Statements" below and Item 1A, "Risk Factors," in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Our customers typically require us to reduce our prices over the life of a vehicle model and, at the same time, assume significant responsibility for the design, development and engineering of our products. Our financial performance is largely dependent on our ability to offset these price reductions with product cost reductions through product design enhancement, supply chain management, manufacturing efficiencies and restructuring actions. We also seek to enhance our financial performance by investing in product development, design capabilities and new product initiatives that respond to and anticipate the needs of our customers and consumers. We continually evaluate operational and strategic alternatives to improve our business structure and align our business with the changing needs of our customers and major industry trends affecting our business. 
 Financial Measures 
 In evaluating our financial condition and operating performance, we focus primarily on earnings, operating margins, cash flows and return on invested capital. Our strategy includes expanding our business with new and existing customers globally through new products, including those aligned with the trend toward electrification. We also have increased our vertical integration capabilities globally, as well as expanded our component manufacturing capacity in Asia, Central America, Eastern Europe, Mexico and Northern Africa and our low-cost engineering capabilities in Asia, Eastern Europe and Northern Africa. 
 Our success in generating cash flow will depend, in part, on our ability to manage working capital effectively. Working capital can be significantly impacted by the timing of cash flows from sales and purchases. Historically, we generally have been successful in aligning our supplier payment terms with our customer payment terms. However, our ability to continue to do so may be impacted by adverse automotive industry conditions, including inconsistent production schedules due to supply shortages and lower consumer demand, changes to our customers' payment terms and the financial condition of our suppliers. In addition, our cash flow is impacted by our ability to manage our inventory and capital spending effectively. We utilize return on invested capital as a measure of the efficiency with which our assets generate earnings. Improvements in our return on invested capital will depend on our ability to maintain an appropriate asset base for our business and to increase productivity and operating efficiency. 
 Acquisition 
 In July 2024, we completed the acquisition of WIP Industrial Automation ("WIP"), a privately held supplier based in Valladolid, Spain. WIP develops, integrates and deploys cutting-edge technologies to create customized automation solutions for production applications used in our business. Our acquisition of WIP further strengthens our robotics and AI-based capabilities, which are important for production efficiency, quality and safety in a modern manufacturing environment. 
 Operational Restructuring 
 In the first nine months of 2024, we incurred pretax restructuring costs of 108 million and related manufacturing inefficiency charges of approximately 4 million, as compared to pretax restructuring costs of 96 million and related manufacturing inefficiency charges of approximately 1 million in the first nine months of 2023. None of the individual restructuring actions initiated in the first nine months of 2024 were material. Further, there have been no changes in previously initiated restructuring actions that have resulted (or will result) in a material change to our restructuring costs. 
 Our restructuring actions include plant closures and workforce reductions and are initiated to maintain our competitive footprint or are in response to customer initiatives or changes in global and regional automotive markets. Our restructuring actions are designed to maintain or improve our operating results and profitability throughout the automotive industry cycles. Restructuring actions are generally funded within twelve months of initiation and are funded by cash flows from operating activities and existing cash balances. We expect to incur approximately 50 million of additional restructuring costs related to activities initiated as of September 28, 2024, all of which are expected to be incurred in the next twelve months. We plan to implement additional restructuring actions in order to align our manufacturing capacity and other costs with prevailing regional automotive production levels. Such future restructuring actions are dependent on market conditions, customer actions and other factors.

 Common Stock Share Repurchase Program and Quarterly Cash Dividends 
 We may implement share repurchases through a variety of methods, including, but not limited to, open market purchases, accelerated stock repurchase programs and structured repurchase transactions. The extent to which we may repurchase our outstanding common stock and the timing of such repurchases will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, prevailing market conditions, alternative uses of capital and other factors. See " Forward-Looking Statements" below. 
 Since the first quarter of 2011, our Board of Directors (the "Board") has authorized 6.7 billion in share repurchases under our common stock share repurchase program (the "Repurchase Program"), including an increase in our share repurchase authorization to 1.5 billion on February 16, 2024. In the first nine months of 2024, we repurchased 299 million of shares. As of September 28, 2024, we have a remaining repurchase authorization of 1.2 billion, which expires on December 31, 2026. 
 Our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.77 per share of common stock in the first, second and third quarters of 2024. 
 For further information related to our common stock share repurchase program and our quarterly cash dividends, see " Liquidity and Capital Resources Capitalization" below and Note 15, "Comprehensive Income (Loss) and Equity," to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Report.

 Three Months Ended September 28, 2024 vs. Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Net sales in the third quarter of 2024 were 5.6 billion, as compared to 5.8 billion in the third quarter of 2023. Lower production volumes on Lear platforms in North America, Europe and Africa, and Asia negatively impacted net sales by 463 million. This decrease was offset by new business in every region, which increased net sales by 264 million. Commercial recoveries were offset by the impact of selling price reductions and foreign exchange rate fluctuations. 
 (in millions) Cost of Sales Third quarter 2023 5,362.8 Material cost (198.6) Labor cost (32.6) Depreciation 5.4 Other 42.1 Third quarter 2024 5,179.1 
 Cost of sales was 5.2 billion in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to 5.4 billion in the third quarter of 2023. Lower production volumes on Lear platforms reduced cost of sales. This decrease was offset by new business, which increased cost of sales. 
 Gross profit and gross margin were 405 million and 7.3 of net sales, respectively, in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to 418 million and 7.2 of net sales, respectively, in the third quarter of 2023. Lower production volumes on Lear platforms, net of new business, reduced gross profit by 50 million. The impact of favorable operating performance, including the benefit of restructuring actions, and lower restructuring costs was partially offset by selling price reductions. These factors had a corresponding impact on gross margin. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses, including engineering and development expenses, were 174 million in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to 183 million in the third quarter of 2023, primarily reflecting lower compensation-related expenses. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 3.1 in the third quarter of 2024 and 3.2 in the third quarter of 2023.

 Other expense, net, which includes non-income related taxes, foreign exchange gains and losses, gains and losses related to certain derivative instruments and hedging activities, gains and losses on the disposal of fixed assets, the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost and other miscellaneous income and expense, was 3 million in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to 6 million in the third quarter of 2023. 
 In the third quarter of 2024, the provision for income taxes was 47 million, representing an effective tax rate of 24.7 on pretax income before equity in net income of affiliates of 191 million. In the third quarter of 2023, the provision for income taxes was 47 million, representing an effective tax rate of 24.9 on pretax income before equity in net income of affiliates of 189 million, for the reasons described below. For further information, see Note 13, "Income Taxes," to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Report. 
 In the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, the provision for income taxes was primarily impacted by the level and mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions. In the third quarter of 2024, we recognized net tax benefits of 5 million related to restructuring charges and various other items. In the third quarter of 2023, we recognized net tax benefits of 7 million related to the release of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of a foreign subsidiary, restructuring charges and various other items. 
 Excluding these items, the effective tax rate for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023 approximated the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 21 , adjusted for income taxes on foreign earnings, losses and remittances, valuation allowances, tax credits, income tax incentives and other permanent items. 
 Equity in net income of affiliates was 13 million in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to 10 million in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Net income attributable to Lear was 136 million, or 2.41 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to 133 million, or 2.25 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2023. Net income decreased for the reasons described above, and diluted net income per share increased due to a reduction in shares outstanding as a result of our Repurchase Program. 
 
 Reportable Operating Segments 
 We have two reportable operating segments: Seating and E-Systems. For a description of our reportable operating segments, see "Executive Overview" above. 
 The financial information presented below is for our two reportable operating segments and our other category for the periods presented. The other category includes unallocated costs related to corporate headquarters, regional headquarters and the elimination of intercompany activities, none of which meets the requirements for being classified as an operating segment. Corporate and regional headquarters costs include various support functions, such as information technology, advanced research and development, corporate finance, legal, executive administration and human resources. Financial measures regarding each segment's pretax income before equity in net income of affiliates, interest expense, net and other expense, net ("segment earnings") and segment earnings divided by net sales ("margin") are not measures of performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). Segment earnings and the related margin are used by management to evaluate the performance of our reportable operating segments. Segment earnings should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income attributable to Lear, net cash provided by operating activities or other income statement or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP or as measures of profitability or liquidity. In addition, segment earnings, as we determine it, may not be comparable to related or similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 
 For a reconciliation of consolidated segment earnings to consolidated income before provision for income taxes and equity in net income of affiliates, see Note 17, "Segment Reporting," to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Report.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Our primary liquidity needs are to fund general business requirements, including working capital requirements, capital expenditures, operational restructuring actions and debt service requirements. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under available credit facilities and our existing cash balance. 
 Cash Provided by Subsidiaries 
 A substantial portion of our operating income is generated by our subsidiaries. As a result, we are dependent on the earnings and cash flows of and the combination of dividends, royalties, intercompany loan repayments and other distributions and advances from our subsidiaries to provide the funds necessary to meet our obligations. 
 As of September 28, 2024 and December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents of 571 million and 803 million, respectively, were held in foreign subsidiaries and can be repatriated, primarily through the repayment of intercompany loans and the payment of dividends. There are no restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to Lear that would have a material impact on Lear. 
 For further information related to potential dividends from our non-U.S. subsidiaries, see Note 9, "Income Taxes," to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Adequacy of Liquidity Sources 
 As of September 28, 2024, we had 764 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand and 2.0 billion in available borrowing capacity under our credit agreement. Together with cash provided by operating activities, we believe that this will enable us to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future and to satisfy ordinary course business obligations. In addition, we expect to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends and repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our authorized common stock share repurchase program, although such actions are at the discretion of our Board and will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, prevailing market conditions, alternative uses of capital and other factors that our Board may consider at its discretion. 
 Our future financial results and our ability to continue to meet our liquidity needs are subject to, and will be affected by, cash flows from operations, as well as restructuring activities, automotive industry conditions, the financial condition of our customers and suppliers, supply chain disruptions and other related factors. Additionally, an economic downturn or further reduction in production levels could negatively impact our financial condition. 
 For further discussion of the risks and uncertainties affecting our cash flows from operations and our overall liquidity, see " Executive Overview" above, " Forward-Looking Statements" below and Item 1A, "Risk Factors," in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Cash Flows 
 A summary of net cash used in operating activities is shown below (in millions): 
 Nine Months Ended September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Increase (Decrease) in Cash Flow Consolidated net income and depreciation and amortization 939 953 (14) Net change in working capital items: Accounts receivable (582) (615) 33 Inventory (6) (185) 179 Accounts payable 47 371 (324) Accrued liabilities and other 35 175 (140) Net change in working capital items (506) (254) (252) Other 6 (19) 25 Net cash provided by operating activities 439 680 (241) Net cash used in investing activities (368) (603) 235 Net cash used in financing activities (506) (208) (298) 
 Operating Activities 
 In the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was 439 million and 680 million, respectiv ely. The decrease in operating cash flow reflects an incremental increase in working capital during the first nine months of 2024, as compared to the first nine months of 2023, largely related to launch delays and uncertain production schedules. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 368 million in the first nine months of 2024, as compared to 603 million in the first nine months of 2023. In the first nine months of 2023, we paid 175 million for our acquisition of I.G. Bauerhin ("IGB"). Capital spending was 367 million in the first nine months of 2024, as compared to 433 million in the first nine months of 2023. Capital spending is estimated to be 575 million in 2024. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 506 million in the first nine months of 2024, as compared to 208 million in the first nine months of 2023. In the first nine months of 2024, we paid 311 million for repurchases of our common stock, 132 million in dividends to Lear stockholders and 70 million in dividends to noncontrolling interest holders.

 Capitalization 
 Short-Term Borrowings 
 We utilize uncommitted lines of credit as needed for our short-term working capital fluctuations. As of September 28, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had lines of credit from banks totaling 369 million and 338 million, respectivel y. As of September 28, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had short-term debt balances outstanding related to draws on our lines of credit of 28 million.

 Commodity Prices and Availability 
 Raw material, energy and commodity costs can be volatile, reflecting, among other things, changes in supply and demand, logistics issues, global trade and tariff policies, and geopolitical issues. We have commodity price risk with respect to purchases of certain raw materials, including steel, copper, diesel fuel, chemicals, resins and leather. Our primary commodity cost exposures relate to steel, copper and leather. We have developed and implemented strategies to mitigate the impact of such costs through the selective in-sourcing of components, the continued consolidation of our supply base, longer-term purchase commitments, commercial recovery mechanisms and the selective expansion of low-cost country sourcing and engineering, as well as value engineering and product benchmarking. Further, the majority of the steel used in our products is comprised of fabricated components that are integrated into a seat system, such as seat frames, recliner mechanisms, seat tracks and other mechanical components. Therefore, our exposure to changes in steel prices is primarily indirect, through purchased components. Additionally, approximately 88 of our copper purchases and a significant portion of our leather and direct steel purchases are subject to price index agreements with our customers and suppliers. Certain of these strategies also may limit our opportunities in a declining commodity price environment. In the current environment of elevated raw material, energy and commodity costs, these strategies, together with commercial negotiations with our customers and suppliers, have offset a significant portion of the adverse impact. If these costs increase, it could have an adverse impact on our operating results in the foreseeable future. 
 See " Forward-Looking Statements" below and Item 1A, "Risk Factors Increases in the costs and restrictions on the availability of raw materials, energy, commodities and product components could adversely affect our financial performance," in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 For further information related to the financial instruments described above, see Note 18, "Financial Instruments," to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Report. 
 
 OTHER MATTERS 
 Legal and Environmental Matters 
 We are involved from time to time in various legal proceedings and claims, including, without limitation, commercial and contractual disputes, product liability claims, and environmental and other matters. As of September 28, 2024, we have recorded reserves for pending legal disputes, including commercial and contractual disputes, product liability claims and other legal matters, of 14 million. In addition, as of September 28, 2024, we have recorded reserves for warranty and recall matters of 30 million and environmental matters of 5 million. Although these reserves were determined in accordance with GAAP, the ultimate outcomes of these matters are inherently uncertain, and actual results may differ significantly from current estimates. For a description of risks related to various legal proceedings and claims, see Item 1A, "Risk Factors," in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. For a more complete description of our outstanding material legal proceedings, see Note 16, "Legal and Other Contingencies," to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Report. 
 Significant Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Certain of our accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions are based on our historical experience, the terms of existing contracts, our evaluation of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers and suppliers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. However, these estimates and assumptions are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Accordingly, actual results in these areas may differ significantly from our estimates.

 ITEM 3 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 MARKET RISK SENSITIVITY 
 In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. We manage a portion of these risks through the use of derivative financial instruments in accordance with our policies. We enter into all hedging transactions for periods consistent with the underlying exposures. We do not enter into derivative instruments for trading purposes. 
 Foreign Exchange 
 Operating results may be impacted by our buying, selling and financing in currencies other than the functional currency of our operating companies ("transactional exposure"). We may mitigate a portion of this risk by entering into forward foreign exchange, futures and option contracts. The foreign exchange contracts are executed with banks that we believe are creditworthy. Gains and losses related to foreign exchange contracts are deferred where appropriate and included in the measurement of the foreign currency transaction subject to the hedge. Gains and losses incurred related to foreign exchange contracts are generally offset by the direct effects of currency movements on the underlying transactions. 
 A summary of the notional amount and estimated aggregate fair value of our outstanding foreign exchange contracts is shown below (in millions): 
 September 28, 2024 December 31, 2023 Notional amount (contract maturities (Adverse Earnings Impact) Hypothetical Strengthening (1) 
 September 28, 2024 December 31, 2023 U.S. dollar 
 10 10 15 Euro 10 29 34 
 (1) Relative to all other currencies to which it is exposed for a twelve-month period 
 46 

Table of Contents 
 LEAR CORPORATION 

 A sensitivity analysis related to the aggregate fair value of our outstanding foreign exchange contracts is shown below (in millions): 
 Estimated Change in Fair Value Hypothetical Change (2) 
 September 28, 2024 December 31, 2023 U.S. dollar 10 174 156 Euro 10 76 98 
 (2) Relative to all other currencies to which it is exposed for a twelve-month period 
 There are certain shortcomings inherent in the sensitivity analyses above. The analyses assume that all currencies would uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the U.S. dollar or Euro. In reality, some currencies may strengthen while others may weaken, causing the earnings impact to increase or decrease depending on the currency and the direction of the rate movement. 
 In addition to the transactional exposure described above, our operating results are impacted by the translation of our foreign operating income into U.S. dollars ("translational exposure"). In 2023, net sales outside of the United States accounted for 79 of our consolidated net sales, although certain non-U.S. sales are U.S. dollar denominated. We do not enter into foreign exchange contracts to mitigate our translational exposure. 
 Interest Rates 
 Our variable rate obligations are sensitive to changes in interest rates. As of September 28, 2024, we had 150 million outstanding under our Term Loan. Advances under the Term Loan generally bear interest based on the Daily or Term SOFR (as defined in the Term Loan agreement) plus a margin, determined in accordance with a pricing grid, that ranges from 1.00 to 1.525 . As of September 28, 2024, the interest rate was 6.435 . 
 A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the interest rate on our Term Loan would increase annual interest expense and related cash interest payments by approximately 2 million. 
 
 ITEM 4 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 (a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer along with the Company's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this Report. The Company's disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. Based on the evaluation described above, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer along with the Company's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the desired control objectives were achieved as of the end of the period covered by this Report. 
 (b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 28, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Contact with any Customers includes responding to contact initiated by Customers. 
 
 (d) The Participant acknowledges and agrees that damages in the event of a breach or threatened breach of the covenants in this Section 6 will be difficult to determine and will not afford a full and adequate remedy, and therefore agrees that the Company, in addition to seeking actual damages, may seek specific enforcement of such covenants in any court of competent jurisdiction, including, without limitation, by the issuance of an injunction, without the necessity of a 

bond. The Participant and the Company agree that the provisions of this Section 6 are reasonable. However, should any court or arbitrator determine that any provision of the covenants of this Section 6 are unreasonable, either in period of time, geographical area, or otherwise, the parties agree that this Section 6 should be interpreted and enforced to the maximum extent which such court or arbitrator deems reasonable.

The Participant further agrees that Participant will provide the Company with such information as the Company may request about the Participant s new position to allow the Company to determine whether such position and duties would likely lead to a violation of this Section 6 (except that the Participant need not provide any information that would constitute confidential or trade secret information of the entity which Participant intends to be employed by, associated with, or represent). 
 
 (f) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if the Participant is a party to a written employment or severance agreement signed on behalf of the Company or its Affiliate that contains restrictive covenants that conflict with the covenants set forth in this Section 6, such conflicting provisions of this Section 6 shall not apply, but any non-conflicting provisions shall remain in force and will supplement and be read and construed in concert with such agreement.

If the Participant does not execute and deliver the Release within sixty (60) calendar days of the Participant s termination of employment, or if the Participant revokes the Release within any specified revocation period, the Participant will nevertheless remain subject to the restrictions in Section 6(a) for the number of months that the Company will require the restrictions to apply. At the Company s option, the Severance will be paid in accordance with the Company s customary local payroll practices, in either a lump sum or equal installments (with respect to employees located outside of the United States, to the extent administratively practicable in the jurisdiction in which the Participant works) beginning on the first payroll payment date following the sixtieth (60th) calendar day after the termination of employment, regardless of when the Release is returned to the Company, and ending on the payroll payment date that is nearest to the date as of which the restrictions in Section 6(a) no longer apply. 

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein, or in any other Award Agreement to which the Participant is subject, to the contrary, to the extent that (i) the Company elects to pay the Severance described in Section 7(a) in lieu of waiving the provisions of Section 6(a) hereof, if applicable, and (ii) the Participant is subject to more than one Award Agreement that provides for the possibility of severance benefits upon a termination of the Participant s employment in exchange for post-employment compliance with a restrictive covenant provision, then the payment by the Company of severance benefits under the Award Agreement with severance benefits most favorable to the Participant shall be deemed to satisfy the Company s obligation to pay severance in exchange for post-employment compliance with a restrictive covenant under such provisions in all such Award Agreements, and the Participant will not be entitled to receive any additional severance. 
 
 8. Confidential Information .
