 The Bank, as a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta FHLB ), is required 
to own capital stock in the FHLB based 
 generally upon the balances of residential and commercial real estate loans and FHLB 
advances. 
The Bank s investment in FHLB

per share), which approximates its fair value. 
No ready market exists for the 
 FHLB stock, and it has no quoted market value; however, 
the Bank may request redemption at par value of any stock in excess of the

are U.S. government agency 
 securities issued by U.S. government sponsored entities. 
We believe 
the long history of no credit losses on government securities 
 indicates that the expectation of nonpayment of the amortized cost basis is effectively 
zero. 
At September 30, 2024, all collateralized 
 mortgage obligation securities, mortgage-backed securities, Small Business 
Administration securities, U.S. Agency, 
and U.S. Treasury 
 bonds held were AAA rated. 
The remaining 

positions (municipal securities and corporate bonds) have a credit component. 
At 
 September 30, 2024, corporate debt securities had an allowance for credit 
losses of 

and municipal securities had an allowance 
 of 
 
 .

t assess or record expected credit losses due to the zero loss assumption. 
The Company monitors the credit quality of its 
 municipal and corporate securities portfolio via credit ratings 
which are updated on a quarterly basis. 
On a quarterly basis, municipal 
 and corporate securities in an unrealized loss position are evaluated to determine 
if the loss is attributable to credit related factors and 
 if an allowance for credit loss is needed.

The decrease in the allowance was primarily due to lower loan 
 balances offset by higher loss rates and loan grade migration 
. 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the allowance for loans 
 HFI increased by 

million and reflected a provision expense of 

million and net loan charge-offs of 

million. 
The increase 
 was primarily driven by incremental reserves needed for loan growth and 
a higher loss rate for the residential real estate portfolio due 
 to slower prepayment speeds. 
Unemployment forecast scenarios were utilized to estimate probability 
of default and are weighted 
 based on management s estimate 
of probability.

 Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing 
Financial Difficulty. 

 Occasionally, the Company may 
modify loans to borrowers who are 
 experiencing financial difficulty. 
Loan modifications to borrowers in financial difficulty are loans in 
which the Company has granted 
 an economic concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. 
In these instances, as part of a work-out alternative, the 
 Company will make concessions including the extension of the loan 
term, a principal moratorium, a reduction in the interest rate, or a 
 combination thereof. 
The impact of the modifications and defaults are factored into the allowance for credit 
losses on a loan-by-loan 
 basis. 
Thus, specific reserves are established based upon the results of either a 
discounted cash flow analysis or the underlying 
 collateral value, if the loan is deemed to be collateral dependent. 
A modified loan classification can be removed if the borrower s 
 financial condition improves such that the borrower is no longer in financial difficulty, 
the loan has not had any forgiveness of 
 principal or interest, and the loan is subsequently refinanced or restructured 
at market terms and qualifies as a new loan. 
 At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company did 
 
 t have any modified loans made to borrowers due to the 
 borrower experiencing financial difficulty.

 NOTE 4 MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES 
 The Company s mortgage 
banking activities include mandatory delivery loan sales, forward sales contracts used 
to manage residential 
 loan pipeline price risk, utilization of warehouse lines to fund secondary 
market residential loan closings, and residential mortgage 
 servicing. 

 Residential Mortgage Loan Production 
 The Company originates, markets, and services conventional and 
government-sponsored residential mortgage loans. 
Generally, 
 conforming fixed rate residential mortgage loans are held for sale in the 
secondary market and non-conforming and adjustable-rate 
 residential mortgage loans may be held for investment. 
The volume of residential mortgage loans originated for sale and secondary 
 market prices are the primary drivers of origination revenue. 
 Residential mortgage loan commitments are generally outstanding for 30 
to 90 days, which represents the typical period from 
 commitment to originate a residential mortgage loan to when the closed 
loan is sold to an investor. 
Residential mortgage loan 
 commitments are subject to both credit and price risk. 
Credit risk is managed through underwriting policies and procedures, including 
 collateral requirements, which are generally accepted by the secondary 
loan markets. 
Price risk is primarily related to interest rate 
 fluctuations and is partially managed through forward sales of residential 
mortgage-backed securities (primarily to-be announced 
 securities, or TBAs) or mandatory delivery commitments with investors. 

 The unpaid principal balance of residential mortgage loans held for sale, 
notional amounts of derivative contracts related to residential 
 mortgage loan commitments, 
such as interest rate lock commitments IRLC s 
and forward contract sales and their related fair 
 values are set- forth below.

 Residential Mortgage Servicing
 The Company may retain the right to service residential mortgage loans 
sold. 
The unpaid principal balance of loans serviced for 
 others is the primary driver of servicing revenue. 
 The following represents a summary of mortgage servicing rights.

Remaining contractual term (in months) 

Conforming conventional loans serviced by the Company are sold to Federal 
National Mortgage Association FNMA on a non-
 recourse basis, whereby foreclosure losses are generally the responsibility 
of FNMA and not the Company. 
The government loans 
 serviced by the Company are secured through the Government National 
Mortgage Association GNMA ), whereby the Company is 
 insured against loss by the Federal Housing Administration or partially 
guaranteed against loss by the Veterans 
Administration. 
At 
 September 30, 2024, the servicing portfolio balance consisted of 
the following loan types: FNMA ), GNMA ), and private 
 investor ). 
FNMA and private investor loans are structured as actual/actual payment remittance. 

 The Company had 

delinquent residential mortgage loans in GNMA pools serviced by the Company 
at September 30, 2024 and 
 December 31, 2023, respectively. 
The Company had 

repurchases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 

million and 

million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, in delinquent 
residential loans from the 
 GNMA pools. 
When delinquent residential loans are repurchased, the Company 
has the intention to modify their terms and include the 
 loans in new GNMA pools.

 Ending balance 

The Company did 
 
 t record any permanent impairment losses on mortgage servicing rights for the 
three months ended September 30, 
 2024 or 2023. 

 The key unobservable inputs used in determining the fair value of the Company s 
mortgage servicing rights were as follows: 

Annual prepayment speeds 

Cost of servicing (per loan) 

Changes in residential mortgage interest rates directly affect 
the prepayment speeds used in valuing the Company s 
mortgage 
 servicing rights. 
A separate third party model is used to estimate prepayment speeds based on interest rates, housing 
turnover rates, 
 estimated loan curtailment, anticipated defaults, and other relevant factors. 
The weighted average annual prepayment speed was 
 
 at September 30, 2024 and 
 
 at December 31, 2023. 

 Warehouse

Borrowings 

Warehouse 
line borrowings are classified as short-term borrowings. 
At December 31, 2023, warehouse line borrowings totaled 
 
 million. At September 30, 2024, the Company had residential mortgage 
loans held for sale pledged as collateral under the above 
 warehouse lines of credit and master repurchase agreements. 
The above agreements also contain covenants which include certain 
 financial requirements, including maintenance of minimum tangible 
net worth, minimum liquid assets, and maximum debt to net 
 worth ratio, as defined in the agreements. 
The Company was in compliance with all significant debt covenants at September 30, 
2024. 

 The Company has extended a 

million warehouse line of credit to CCHL, a 
 
 owned subsidiary entity. 
Balances and 
 transactions under this line of credit are eliminated in the Company s 
consolidated financial statements and thus not included in the 
 total short term borrowings noted on the Consolidated Statement of 
Financial Condition. 
The balance of this line of credit was 
 
 million and 

million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

million at September 30, 2024 were designed as a cash flow hedge for 
 subordinated debt. 
Under the swap arrangement, the Company will pay a fixed interest rate of 
 
 and receive a variable interest 
 rate based on three-month CME Term 
SOFR (secured overnight financing rate). 
 For derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges of interest rate 
risk, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in 
 accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI and subsequently 
reclassified into interest expense in the same period(s) during 
 which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Amounts reported 
in accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives 
 will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the 
Company s variable-rate subordinated 
debt.

 Contingencies
 . 
The Company is a party to lawsuits and claims arising out of the normal course of business. 
In management's opinion, 
 there are 

known pending claims or litigation, the outcome of which would, individually or in 
the aggregate, have a material effect 
 on the consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows 
of the Company. 
 Indemnification Obligation
 . 
The Company is a member of the Visa U.S.A. network. 
Visa U.S.A member banks are 
required to 
 indemnify the Visa U.S.A. 
network for potential future settlement of certain litigation (the Covered Litigation 
that relates to several 
 antitrust lawsuits challenging the practices of Visa 
and MasterCard International. 
In 2008, the Company, as a member 
of the Visa 
 U.S.A. network, obtained Class B shares of Visa, 
Inc. upon its initial public offering. 
Since its initial public offering, Visa, 
Inc. has 
 funded a litigation reserve for the Covered Litigation resulting in a reduction 
in the Class B shares held by the Company. 
During the 
 first quarter of 2011, the Company sold its remaining 
Class B shares. 
Associated with this sale, the Company entered into a swap 
 contract with the purchaser of the shares that requires a payment to the 
counterparty in the event that Visa, Inc. makes 
subsequent 
 revisions to the conversion ratio for its Class B shares. 
Conversion ratio payments and ongoing fixed quarterly charges 
are reflected in 
 earnings in the period incurred. 
Fixed charges included in the swap liability are payable quarterly 
until the litigation reserve is fully 
 liquidated and at which time the aforementioned swap contract will be terminated. 
Quarterly fixed payments approximate

million, respectively, 
for 
 the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
Issuances are valued based on the change in fair value of the underlying mortgage loan 
 from inception of the IRLC to the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition 
date, adjusted for pull-through rates and costs to 
 originate. 
IRLCs transferred out of Level 3 represent IRLCs that were funded 
and moved to mortgage loans held for sale, at fair 
 value. 
 Assets Measured at Fair Value 
on a Non-Recurring Basis
 Certain assets are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis (i.e., the 
assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis 
 but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances). 
An example would be assets exhibiting evidence of impairment. 

 The following is a description of valuation methodologies used for assets measured 
on a non-recurring basis. 

 Collateral Dependent Loans
 . 
Impairment for collateral dependent loans is measured using the fair 
value of the collateral less selling 
 costs. 
The fair value of collateral is determined by an independent valuation 
or professional appraisal in conformance with banking 
 regulations. 
Collateral values are estimated using Level 3 inputs due to the volatility in the real estate market, 
and the judgment and 
 estimation involved in the real estate appraisal process. 
Collateral dependent loans are reviewed and evaluated on at least a quarterly 
 basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly. 
Valuation 
techniques are consistent with those techniques applied in prior 
 periods. 
Collateral-dependent loans had a carrying value of 

million with a valuation allowance of 

million at September 30, 
 2024 and a carrying value of 

million and a 

million valuation allowance at December 31, 2023.

 allowance for loan servicing rights. 

 Assets and Liabilities Disclosed at Fair Value 
 The Company is required to disclose the estimated fair value of financial instruments, 
both assets and liabilities, for which it is 
 practical to estimate fair value and the following is a description of valuation 
methodologies used for those assets and liabilities. 
 Cash and Short-Term 
Investments. 

 The carrying amount of cash and short-term investments is used to approximate 
fair value, given 
 the short time frame to maturity and as such assets do not present unanticipated 
credit concerns. 
 Securities Held to Maturity
 . 
Securities held to maturity are valued in accordance with the methodology 
previously noted in the 
 caption Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value 
on a Recurring Basis Securities Available 
for Sale. 
 Other Equity Securities.
 
Other equity securities are accounted for under the equity method (Topic 
323) and recorded at cost. 
These 
 securities are not readily marketable securities and are reflected in Other 
Assets on the Statement of Financial Condition. 

Loans.
 
The loan portfolio is segregated into categories and the fair value of each loan category is calculated 
using present value 
 techniques based upon projected cash flows and estimated discount 
rates. 
The values reported reflect the incorporation of a liquidity 
 discount to meet the objective of exit price valuation. 

 Deposits.
 
The fair value of Noninterest Bearing Deposits, NOW Accounts, Money Market 
Accounts and Savings Accounts are the 
 amounts payable on demand at the reporting date. The fair value of fixed maturity 
certificates of deposit is estimated using present 
 value techniques and rates currently offered for deposits of 
similar remaining maturities. 
 Subordinated Notes Payable. 
 
The fair value of each note is calculated using present value techniques, 
based upon projected cash 
 flows and estimated discount rates as well as rates being offered 
for similar obligations. 
 Short-Term 
and Long-Term 
Borrowings.
 
The fair value of each note is calculated using present value techniques, 
based upon 
 projected cash flows and estimated discount rates as well as rates being offered 
for similar debt.

 BUSINESS OVERVIEW 
 We are a financial 
holding company headquartered in Tallahassee, 
Florida, and we are the parent of our wholly owned subsidiary, 
 Capital City Bank (the Bank or CCB ). 
We offer 
a broad array of products and services through a total of 63 full-service offices 
 and 105 ATMs/ITMs 
located in Florida, Georgia, and Alabama. 
Through Capital City Home Loans, LLC CCHL ), we have 29 
 additional offices in the Southeast for our mortgage banking business. 
We provide 
a full range of banking services, including 
 traditional deposit and credit services, mortgage banking, asset management, 
trust, merchant services, bankcards, securities brokerage 
 services and financial advisory services, including life insurance products 
, 
risk management and asset protection services. 

 Our profitability, like 
most financial institutions, is dependent to a large extent upon net 
interest income, which is the difference 
 between the interest and fees received on interest earning assets, such as loans and 
securities, and the interest paid on interest-bearing 
 liabilities, principally deposits and borrowings. 
Results of operations are also affected by the provision for credit losses, operating 
 expenses such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and other 
operating expenses including income taxes, and noninterest 
 income such as mortgage banking revenues, wealth management fees, 
deposit fees, and bank card fees. 
 We have included 
a detailed discussion of our long-term strategic objectives as part of the MD A section 
of our 2023 Form 10-K, as 
 amended.

 FINANCIAL OVERVIEW 
 Results of Operations 
 Performance Summary. 

 Net income attributable to common shareowners totaled 13.1 
million, or 0.77 per diluted share, for the 
 third quarter of 2024 compared to 14.2 million, or 0.83 per diluted 
share, for the second quarter of 2024, and 12.7 million, or 0.74 
 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2023. 
For the first nine months of 2024, net income attributable to common shareowners 
 totaled 39.8 million, or 2.35 per diluted share, compared to net income of 40.5 
million, or 2.38 per diluted share, for the same 
 period of 2023. 

 Net Interest Income. 

 Tax-equivalent net 
interest income for the third quarter of 2024 totaled 40.2 million, compared 
to 39.3 million 
 for the second quarter of 2024, and 39.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. 
Compared to the second quarter of 2024, the increase 
 was primarily due to increases in loan and investment interest income 
and a decrease in deposit interest expense, partially offset by 
a 
 decrease in overnight funds interest income. 
One additional calendar day also contributed to the increase. 
Favorable repricing of 
 existing adjustable/fixed rate loans at higher rates drove the increase in loan 
interest income. 
Compared to the third quarter of 2023, 
 the 0.9 million increase was primarily driven by an increase in loan interest income 
and to a lesser extent overnight funds interest 
 income, partially offset by an increase in deposit interest expense. 
For the first nine months of 2024, tax-equivalent net interest 
 income totaled 118.0 million compared 
to 120.1 million for the same period of 2023 with the decrease primarily attributable 
to an 
 increase in deposit interest expense and a decrease in investment interest income, 
partially offset by an increase in loan interest 
 income. 
Our net interest margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 4.12 , an increase of 10 basis points 
over the second quarter of 
 2024 and an increase of nine basis points over the third quarter of 2023. 

 Provision and Allowance for Credit 
Losses. 
 We recorded 
a provision expense for credit losses of 1.2 million for the third quarter of 
 2024, comparable to the second quarter of 2024 and a 1.2 million decrease 
from the third quarter of 2023. 
Compared to the second 
 quarter of 2024, the provision reflected a 0.7 million increase in the provision 
expense for loans held for investment HFI ), a 0.6 
 million provision benefit for unfunded loan commitments, and a 0.1 
million provision benefit for debt securities. 
For the first nine 
 months of 2024, we recorded a provision expense for credit losses of 3.3 
million compared to 7.7 million for the same period of 
 2023. The decrease reflected a 3.2 million decrease in the provision 
expense for loans HFI and a 1.2 million decrease in the 
 provision for unfunded loan commitments. The decrease in the provision 
for loans HFI was primarily due to lower new loan volume in 
 2024 and lower loan balances. 
The decrease in the provision for unfunded loan commitments reflected a lower 
level of loan 
 commitments. 
At September 30, 2024, the allowance represented 1.11 
of loans HFI compared to 1.09 at June 30, 2024, and 
 1.10 
at December 31, 2023.
 Noninterest Income
 . 
Noninterest income for the third quarter of 2024 totaled 19.5 million compared 
to 19.6 million for the second 
 quarter of 2024 and 16.7 million for the third quarter of 2023. 
The slight decrease from the second quarter of 2024 reflected a 0.4 
 million decrease in mortgage banking revenues partially offset by 
a 0.3 million increase in wealth management fees. 
Compared to 
 the third quarter of 2023, the 2.8 million increase was primarily attributable 
to a 2.1 million increase in mortgage banking revenues 
 driven by a higher gain on sale margin, and a 0.8 million 
increase in wealth management fees. 
For the first nine months of 2024, 
 noninterest income totaled 57.2 million compared to 54.5 million for the same 
period of 2023, primarily attributable to a 3.2 
 million increase in mortgage banking revenues and a 1.8 million increase in 
wealth management fees, partially offset by a 2.1 
 million decrease in other income. 

 Noninterest Expense. 
 Noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2024 totaled 42.9 million compared 
to 40.4 million for the second 
 quarter of 2024 and 39.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. 
The 2.5 million increase over the second quarter of 2024 was 
 primarily due to a 1.4 million increase in compensation and a 1.0 million increase 
in other expense. 
Compared to the third quarter 
 of 2023, the 3.8 million increase was primarily attributable to a 2.8 million 
increase in compensation expense and a 0.9 million 
 increase in other expense. 
For the first nine months of 2024, noninterest expense totaled 123.5 million 
compared to 117.1 million 
 for the same period of 2023 with the 6.4 million increase primarily attributable 
to increases in compensation expense of 4.6 million, 
 occupancy expense of 0.5 million, and other expense of 1.3 million. 

 Financial Condition 
 Earning Assets.
 
Average earning 
assets totaled 3.883 billion for the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 51.9 million, or 1.3 , 
from 
 the second quarter of 2024, and an increase of 59.4 million, or 1.6 , over the 
fourth quarter of 2023. 
The change for both prior 
 periods was driven by variances in deposit balances. 
Compared to the second quarter of 2024, the change in the earning asset mix 
 reflected a 33.2 million decrease in loans HFI, a 11.4 
million decline in investment securities, and a 5.6 million decrease in 
 overnight funds sold. 
Compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, the change in the earning asset mix reflected a 157.1 million 
increase 
 in overnight funds that was partially offset by a 17.7 million decrease 
in loans HFI, a 54.7 million decrease in investment securities 
 and a 25.2 million decline in loans held for sale. 

Loans. 
 Average loans HFI decreased 
 33.2 million, or 1.2 , from the second quarter of 2024 and decreased 17.7 
million, or 0.7 , 
 from the fourth quarter of 2023. 
Period end loans HFI decreased 7.1 million, or 0.3 , from the second quarter of 2024 
and 
 decreased 50.8 million, or 1.9 , from the fourth quarter of 2023. 

36 
 Credit Quality
 . 
Nonperforming assets (nonaccrual loans and other real estate) totaled 7.2 million 
at September 30, 2024 compared to 
 6.2 million at June 30, 2024 and 6.2 million at December 31, 2023. 
At September 30, 2024, nonperforming assets as a percent of 
 total assets equaled 0.17 , compared to 0.15 at June 30, 2024 and 0.15 
at December 31, 2023. 
Nonaccrual loans totaled 6.6 
 million at September 30, 2024, a 1.1 million increase over June 30, 2024 
and a 0.3 million increase over December 31, 2023. 

 Further, classified loans totaled 25.5 million at September 
30, 2024, a 0.1 million decrease from June 30, 2024 and a 3.3 
million 
 increase over December 31, 2023. 
 Deposits
 . 
Average total 
deposits were 3.572 billion for the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 69.0 million, or 1.9 , 
from the 
 second quarter of 2024 and an increase of 23.5 million, or 0.7 , over the 
fourth quarter of 2023. 
At September 30, 2024, total 
 deposits were 3.579 billion, a decrease of 29.5 million, or 0.8 , from 
June 30, 2024, and a decrease of 122.7 million, or 3.3 , 
 from December 31, 2023. 

 Capital
 . 
At September 30, 2024, we were well-capitalized 
with a total risk-based capital ratio of 17.97 and a tangible common 
 equity ratio (a non-GAAP financial measure) of 9.28 compared to 
17.50 and 8.91 , respectively, 
at June 30, 2024 and 16.57 
 and 8.26 , respectively, 
at December 31, 2023. 
At September 30, 2024, all of our regulatory capital ratios exceeded the threshold 
to 
 be well-capitalized 
under the Basel III capital standards.

 Net Interest Income
 Net interest income represents our single largest source of earnings 
and is equal to interest income and fees generated by earning assets 
 less interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities. 
This information is provided on a taxable equivalent basis to reflect the tax-
 exempt status of income earned on certain loans and state and local government 
debt obligations. 
We provide an 
analysis of our net 
 interest income including average yields and rates in Table 
I, Average Balances 
Interest Rates, on page 48. 
 Tax-equivalent net 
interest income for the third quarter of 2024 totaled 40.2 million, compared to 39.3 
million for the second quarter 
 of 2024, and 39.4 
million for the third quarter of 2023. 
Compared to the second quarter of 2024, the increase was primarily due to 
 increases in loan and investment interest income and a decrease in deposit interest expense, 
partially offset by a decrease in overnight 
 funds interest income. 
One additional calendar day also contributed to the increase. 
Favorable repricing of existing adjustable/fixed 
 rate loans at higher rates drove the increase in loan interest income. 
The increase in investment interest income was due to the 
 reinvestment of maturing securities at higher rates. 
The decrease in deposit interest expense was attributable to lower average 
NOW 
 account balances and average rate, in addition to lower rates on promotional 
deposit products. 

 Compared to the third quarter of 2023, the 0.9 million increase was primarily driven 
by an increase in loan interest income and to a 
 lesser extent overnight funds interest income, partially offset by an 
increase in deposit interest expense. 
For the first nine months of 
 2024, tax-equivalent net interest income totaled 118.0 
million compared to 120.1 million for the same period of 2023 with the 
 decrease primarily attributable to an increase in deposit interest expense and 
a decrease in investment interest income, partially offset 
 by an increase in loan interest income. 

 Our net interest margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 4.12 , an increase 
of 10 basis points over the second quarter of 2024 and an 
 increase of nine basis points over the third quarter of 2023. 
For the month of September 2024, our net interest margin was 4.16 . 
For 
 the first nine months of 2024, our net interest margin was 4.05 
compared to 4.04 for the same period of 2023. 
The increase over 
 the second quarter of 2024 reflected favorable loan and investment repricing, 
partially offset by a lower overnight funds rate. 
The 
 increase over both prior year periods reflected higher loan rates partially 
offset by a higher cost of deposits. 
For the third quarter of 
 2024, our cost of funds was 93 basis points, a decrease of four basis points from 
the second quarter of 2024 and an increase of 27 basis 
 points over the third quarter of 2023. 
Our cost of deposits (including noninterest bearing accounts) was 92 basis points, 95 
basis 
 points, and 58 basis points, respectively, 
for the same periods. 
 Provision for Credit Losses
 We recorded 
a provision expense for credit losses of 1.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, comparable 
to the second quarter of 
 2024 and a 1.2 million decrease from the third quarter of 2023. 
Compared to the second quarter of 2024, the provision reflected a 
 0.7 million increase in the provision expense for loans HFI, a 0.6 
million provision benefit for unfunded loan commitments, and a 
 0.1 million provision benefit for debt securities. The increase in the provision 
for loans HFI was primarily due to loan grade 
 migration and slightly higher loss rates partially offset by 
lower loan balances. A lower level of commitments drove the provision 
 benefit for unfunded loan commitments. For the first nine months of 2024, 
we recorded a provision expense for credit losses of 3.3 
 million compared to 7.7 million for the same period of 2023. The decrease 
reflected a 3.2 million decrease in the provision expense 
 for loans HFI and a 1.2 million decrease in the provision for unfunded 
loan commitments. The decrease in the provision for loans 
 HFI was primarily due to lower new loan volume in 2024 and lower loan balance 
s. The decrease in the provision for unfunded loan 
 commitments reflected a lower level of loan commitments. We 
discuss the allowance for credit losses further below. 

38 
 Noninterest Income
 Noninterest income for the third quarter of 2024 totaled 19.5 million compared 
to 19.6 million for the second quarter of 2024 and 
 16.7 million for the third quarter of 2023. 
The slight decrease from the second quarter of 2024 reflected a 0.4 million decrease in 
 mortgage banking revenues partially offset by 
a 0.3 million increase in wealth management fees. 
Compared to the third quarter of 
 2023, the 2.8 million increase was primarily attributable to a 2.1 million increase 
in mortgage banking revenues driven by a higher 
 gain on sale margin, and a 0.8 million increase in wealth management 
fees. 

 For the first nine months of 2024, noninterest income totaled 57.2 million 
compared to 54.5 million for the same period of 2023, 
 primarily attributable to a 3.2 million increase in mortgage banking revenues 
and a 1.8 million increase in wealth management fees, 
 partially offset by a 2.1 million decrease in other income. 
The increase in mortgage banking revenues was due to a higher gain 
on 
 sale margin. 
The increase in wealth management fees was primarily driven by higher retail brokerage 
fees and to a lesser extent trust 
 fees, primarily attributable to both new account growth and higher 
account values driven by higher market returns. 
The decrease in 
 other income was primarily attributable to a 1.4 million gain from the 
sale of mortgage servicing rights in the second quarter of 2023, 
 and to a lesser extent a decrease in vendor bonus income and miscellaneous income. 

 Noninterest income represented 32.7 of operating revenues (net 
interest income plus noninterest income) in the third quarter of 2024 
 compared to 33.3 in the second quarter of 2024 and 29.9 in the third quarter 
of 2023. 
For the first nine months of 2024, 
 noninterest income represented 32.7 of operating revenues compared 
to 31.2 for the same period of 2023. 

 The table below reflects the major components of noninterest income.

 Significant components of noninterest income are discussed in more 
detail below. 
 Deposit Fees
 . 
Deposit fees for the third quarter of 2024 
totaled 5.5 
million, an increase of 0.1 
million, or 2.5 , over the second 
 quarter of 2024, and an increase of 0.1 
million, or 1.0 , over the third quarter of 2023. 
For the first nine months of 2024, deposit 
 fees totaled 16.1 million, an increase an increase of 0.1 million, or 0.7 , 
over the same period of 2023. 
Compared to the second 
 quarter of 2024, the increase was driven by higher overdraft fees. 
The increase over both prior year periods was primarily due to 
 higher commercial account analysis fee income.
 Bank Card Fees
 . 
Bank card fees for the third quarter of 2024 totaled 3.6 million, a decrease of 0.1 million, or 
3.8 , from the 
 second quarter of 2024, and a decrease of 0.1 million, or 1.6 from 
the third quarter of 2023. 
For the first nine months of 2024, 
 bank card fees totaled 11.0 million, a decrease 
of 0.2 
million, or 1.7 , from the same period of 2023. 
The slight change in fees 
 between all periods reflected variance in debit card utilization as consumer 
spending patterns normalize. 
 Wealth 
Management Fees
 . 
Wealth management fees 
include trust fees through Capital City Trust (i.e., managed 
accounts and 
 trusts/estates), retail brokerage fees through Capital City Investments (i.e., 
investment, insurance products, and retirement accounts), 
 and financial advisory fees through Capital City Strategic Wealth 
(i.e., including the sale of life insurance, risk management and asset 
 protection services). 
Wealth management 
fees for the third quarter of 2024 totaled 4.8 million, an increase 
of 0.3 million, or 7.5 , 
 over the second quarter of 2024, and an increase of 0.8 million, 
or 19.7 , over the third quarter of 2023. 
For the first nine months of 
 2024, wealth management fees totaled 13.9 million, an increase of 1.8 
million, or 15.2 , over the same period of 2023, and 
 reflected an 1.4 million increase in retail brokerage fees and a 0. 
6 
million increase in trust fees that was partially offset by a 0.2 
 million decrease in insurance commission revenue. 
The increase in retail brokerage assets was driven by increased fixed income and 
 annuity product sales and the increase in trust fees reflected both 
new account growth and higher account values/returns reflective of 
 the improved market returns. 
At September 30, 2024, total assets under management were approximately 
 2.950 billion compared to 
 2.770 billion at June 30, 2024 and 2.588 billion at December 31, 2023. 

39 
 Mortgage Banking Revenues. 
 Mortgage banking revenues totaled 4.0 million for the third quarter of 
2024, a decrease of 0.4 million, 
 or 9.5 , from the second quarter of 2024 and an increase of 2.1 million, or 115 
.7 , over the third quarter of 2023. 
For the first nine 
 months of 2024, mortgage banking revenues totaled 11.2 
million compared to 8.1 million for the same period of 2023. 
The 
 decrease compared to the second quarter of 2024 was attributable to slightly 
lower loan sale volume. Compared to the prior year 
 periods, the increase was attributable to a higher gain on sale margin 
which reflected a higher percentage of secondary 
 market/mandatory delivery loan sales. 
We provide 
a detailed overview of our mortgage banking operation, including a detailed 
break-
 down of mortgage banking revenues, mortgage servicing activity, 
and warehouse funding within Note 4 Mortgage Banking 
 Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

 Other
 . 
Other income totaled 1.6 million for the third quarter of 2024, comparable 
to the second quarter of 2024 and a decrease of 
 0.1 million, or 7.0 , from the third quarter of 2023. 
For the first nine months of 2024, other income totaled 5.0 million compared 
 to 7.1 million for the same period of 2023. 
The decrease from 2023 was primarily attributable to a 1.4 million gain from the 
sale of 
 mortgage servicing rights realized in the second quarter of 2023, 
and to a lesser extent a decrease in vendor bonus income and 
 miscellaneous income. 
 Noninterest Expense 
 Noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2024 totaled 42.9 million compared 
to 40.4 million for the second quarter of 2024 and 
 39.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. 
The 2.5 million increase over the second quarter of 2024 was primarily due to 
a 1.4 
 million increase in compensation and a 1.0 million increase in other expense. 
The increase in compensation reflected a 0.9 million 
 increase in salary expense and a 0.5 million increase in associate benefit 
expense. 
The increase in salary expense was driven by 
 annual merit adjustments, and the increase in other associate benefit 
expense was primarily attributable to higher health insurance cost, 
 and to a lesser extent higher stock-based compensation expense. 
The increase in other expense was primarily due to a 0.5 million 
 increase in professional fees, a 0.3 million increase in processing fees, and 
higher miscellaneous expense, which included a 0.5 
 million payment to the counterparty for our VISA Class B share swap due to revision 
to the share conversion rate related to additional 
 funding by VISA of the merchant litigation reserve. 
Compared to the third quarter of 2023, the 3.8 million increase was primarily 
 attributable to a 2.8 million increase in compensation expense and a 0.9 million 
increase in other expense. 
The unfavorable 
 variance in compensation expense reflected a 2.2 million increase in salary expense 
and a 0.6 million increase in associate benefit 
 expense, with the salary variance driven by merit adjustments and the associate 
benefit expense variance reflective of higher health 
 insurance cost. 
Further, salary expense was unfavorably impacted 
by a 1.0 million decrease in realized loan cost (credit offset to 
 salary expense) which reflected lower loan volume in 2024. 
The increase in other expense was attributable to a 0.6 million increase 
 in professional fees and higher miscellaneous expense due to the aforementioned 
 0.5 million share swap payment in the third quarter 
 of 2024. 

 For the first nine months of 2024, noninterest expense totaled 123.5 
million compared to 117.1 million for the same period 
of 2023 
 with the 6.4 million increase primarily attributable to increases in compensation 
expense of 4.6 million, occupancy expense of 0.5 
 million, and other expense of 1.3 million. 
The increase in compensation expense reflected a 3.9 million increase in salary 
expense 
 and a 0.7 million increase in associate benefit expense. 
The increase in salary expense was primarily due to a 2.9 million decrease 
 in realized loan cost (credit offset to salary expense and lower new loan 
volume) and a 1.9 million increase in base salary expense 
 (primarily annual merit raises), partially offset by a decrease in commission 
expense of 1.3 million (lower residential mortgage 
 volume). 
The increase in occupancy was primarily attributable to an increase in maintenance 
agreement expense (security upgrades 
 and addition of interactive teller machines). 
The increase in other expense was primarily due to a 1.8 million gain from the sale of 
a 
 banking office in the first quarter of 2023 and higher miscellaneous 
expense due to the aforementioned 0.5 million share swap 
 payment in 2024, which was partially offset by a 1.0 million decrease 
in pension plan expense (service cost).

 Significant components of noninterest expense are discussed in more detail 
below. 
 Compensation. 

 Compensation expense totaled 25.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, a 1.4 million, 
or 5.7 , increase over the 
 second quarter of 2024 and a 2.8 million, or 12.2 , increase over the third 
quarter of 2023. 
The increase over the second quarter of 
 2024 reflected a 0.9 million increase in salary expense and a 0.5 million 
increase in associate benefit expense. 
The increase in 
 salary expense was driven by annual merit adjustments, and the increase in 
other associate benefit expense was primarily attributable 
 to higher health insurance cost, and to a lesser extent higher stock-based compensation 
expense. 
Compared to the third quarter of 
 2023, the unfavorable variance was attributable to a 2.2 million increase in 
salary expense and a 0.6 million increase in associate 
 benefit expense, with the salary variance driven by merit adjustments and the 
associate benefit expense variance reflective of higher 
 health insurance cost. 
Further, salary expense was unfavorably impacted 
by a 1.0 decrease in realized loan cost (credit offset to 
 salary expense) which reflected lower loan volume in 2024. 
For the first nine months of 2024, compensation expense totaled 74.6 
 million compared to 70.0 million for the same period of 2023 with the 4.6 
million increase attributable to a 3.9 million increase in 
 salary expense and a 0.7 million increase in associate benefit expense. 
The increase in salary expense was primarily due to a 2.9 
 million decrease in realized loan cost (credit offset to salary expense) 
(lower new loan volume) and a 1.9 million increase in base 
 salary expense (primarily annual merit raises), partially offset by 
a 1.3 million decrease in commission expense (lower residential 
 mortgage volume). 
Higher health care cost drove the increase in associate benefit expense. 

 Occupancy
 . 
Occupancy expense totaled 7.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, a 0.1 million 
increase over both the second 
 quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023. 
For the first nine months of 2024, occupancy expense totaled 21.1 million compared 
to 
 20.6 million for the same period of 2023. 
Compared to both prior year periods, 
the increase in occupancy expense was primarily due 
 to higher expense for maintenance agreements (security upgrades and 
interactive teller machines). 

41 
 Other
 . 
Other expense totaled 10.0 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared 
to 9.0 million for the second quarter of 2024 and 
 9.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. 
For the first nine months of 2024, other expense totaled 27.8 million compared 
to 26.5 
 million for the same period of 2023. 
Compared to the second quarter of 2024, the 1.0 million increase was primarily due to 
a 0.5 
 million increase in professional fees, a 0.3 million increase in processing 
fees, and higher miscellaneous expense, which included a 
 0.5 million payment to the counterparty for our VISA Class B share swap due to 
revision to the share conversion rate related to 
 additional funding by VISA of the merchant litigation reserve. 
The 0.9 million increase over the third quarter of 2023 was driven 
by 
 a 0.6 million increase in professional fees and higher miscellaneous expense 
due to the aforementioned 0.5 million share swap 
 payment in the third quarter of 2024. 
For the nine-month period, the 1.3 million increase was primarily due to a 1.8 
million gain 
 from the sale of a banking office in the first quarter of 2023 and 
higher miscellaneous expense in 2024 due to the aforementioned 0.5 
 million share swap payment, which was partially offset by a 1.0 
million decrease in pension plan expense (service cost). 

 Our operating efficiency ratio (expressed as noninterest 
expense as a percentage of the sum of taxable-equivalent net interest income 
 plus noninterest income) was 71.81 for the third quarter of 2024 compared 
to 68.61 for the second quarter of 2024 
and 69.88 for 
 the third quarter of 2023. 
For the first nine months of 2024, this ratio was 70.49 compared to 67.07 
for the same period of 2023. 
 Income Taxes 
 We realized income 
tax expense of 3.0 million (effective rate of 19.1 for the third quarter of 
2024 compared to 3.2 million 
 (effective rate of 18.5 for the second quarter of 2024 
and 3.0 million (effective rate of 20.7 for the third quarter of 2023. 
For 
 the first nine months of 2024, we realized income tax expense of 9.7 
million (effective rate of 20.1 compared to 10.1 million 
 (effective rate of 20.5 for the same period of 2023. 
The decrease in our effective tax rate from both prior year periods was 
 primarily due to a higher level of tax benefit accrued from investments in solar tax 
credit equity funds. 
Absent discrete items, we 
 expect our annual effective tax rate to approximate 20-21 
for 2024. 
 FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 Average earning 
assets totaled 3.883 billion for the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 51.9 million, or 
1.3 , from the second 
 quarter of 2024, and an increase of 59.4 million, or 1.6 , over the 
fourth quarter of 2023. 
The change for both prior periods was 
 driven by variances in deposit balances (see below 
 Deposits). 
Compared to the second quarter of 2024, the change in the earning 
 asset mix reflected a 33.2 million decrease in loans HFI, a 11.4 
million decline in investment securities, and a 5.6 million decrease 
 in overnight funds sold. 
Compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, the change in the earning asset mix reflected a 
 157.1 million 
 increase in overnight funds that was partially offset by 
a 17.7 million decrease in loans HFI, a 54.7 million decrease in investment 
 securities and a 25.2 million decline in loans held for sale. 

 Investment Securities 
 Average investments 
decreased 11.4 million, or 1.2 , from the second 
quarter of 2024 
and 54.7 million, or 5.7 , from the fourth 
 quarter of 2023. Our investment portfolio represented 23.4 of our average 
earning assets for each of the second and the third 
 quarters 
of 2024 compared to 25.2 for the fourth quarter of 2023. 
For the remainder of 2024, we will continue to monitor our 
 overall liquidity position and market conditions to determine if cash flow 
from the investment portfolio should be reinvested or 
 allowed to run-off into overnight funds. 

 The investment portfolio is a significant component of our operations and, as such, 
it functions as a key element of liquidity and 
 asset/liability management. 
Two types of classifications are approved 
for investment securities which are Available 
-for-Sale AFS 
 and Held-to-Maturity HTM ). 
At September 30, 2024, 561.5 million, or 62.5 , of the investment portfolio was classified 
as HTM 
 and 336.2 million, or 37.5 , was classified as AFS. The average 
maturity of our total portfolio at September 30, 2024 was 2.51 
 compared to 2.67 years at June 30, 2024 and 2.91 years at December 31, 2023. 
The duration of our investment portfolio at September 
 30, 2024 was 2.17 years compared to 2.16 years at June 30, 2024 and 2.91 
years at December 31, 2023. 
Additional information on 
 unrealized gains/losses in the AFS and HTM portfolios is provided 
in Note 2 Investment Securities. 
 We 
 determine the classification of a security at the time of acquisition based 
on how the purchase will affect our asset/liability strategy 
 and future business plans and opportunities. 

 We 
 consider multiple factors in determining classification, including 
regulatory capital 
 requirements, volatility in earnings or other comprehensive income, 
and liquidity needs. 
Securities in the AFS portfolio are recorded 
 at fair value with unrealized gains and losses associated with these securities 
recorded net of tax, in the accumulated other 
 comprehensive income component of shareowners equity. 
HTM securities are acquired or owned with the intent of holding 
them to 
 maturity. 
HTM investments are measured at amortized cost. 

 We 
 do not trade, nor do we presently intend to begin trading investment 
 securities for the purpose of recognizing gains and therefore we do not 
maintain a trading portfolio. 

42 
 At September 30, 2024, there were 818 positions (combined AFS and HTM) 
with unrealized losses totaling 40.3 million. 73 of these 
 positions are U.S. Treasuries and carry the full faith 
and credit of the U.S. Government. 
651 were U.S. government agency securities 
 issued by U.S. government sponsored entities. The remaining 94 positions 
(municipal securities and corporate bonds) have a credit 
 component. 
At September 30, 2024, corporate debt securities had an allowance for credit losses of 79,000 
and municipal securities 
 had an allowance of 4,000. 
At September 30, 2024, all collateralized mortgage obligation securities, 
mortgage-backed securities, 
 Small Business Administration securities, 
U.S. Agency, and U.S. Treasury 
bonds held were AAA rated. 

 Loans HFI 
 Average loans 
HFI decreased 33.2 million, or 1.2 , from the second quarter of 2024 and decreased 
 17.7 million, or 0.7 , from the 
 fourth quarter of 2023. 
Compared to the second quarter of 2024, the decrease was driven by a 19.4 
million decrease in consumer 
 loans (primarily indirect auto), a 13.2 million decrease in commercial 
loans, and a 7.7 million decrease in commercial real estate 
 loans, partially offset by a 7.4 million increase in residential 
real estate loans. 
Compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, the decrease 
 was primarily attributable to a 54.5 million decrease in consumer loans (primarily 
indirect auto) and a 24.2 million decrease in 
 commercial loans (primarily tax-exempt loans) that were partially offset 
by a 59.2 million increase in residential real estate loans. 

 Period end loans HFI decreased 7.1 million, or 0.3 , from the second quarter of 
2024 and decreased 50.8 million, or 1.9 , from the 
 fourth quarter of 2023. 
Compared to the second quarter of 2024, the decline reflected a 20.9 million decrease 
in consumer loans 
 (primarily indirect auto), a 10.4 million decrease in commercial loans, and 
a 3.2 million decline in commercial real estate loans, 
 partially offset by a 10.9 million increase in residential real estate loans and 
a 18.1 million increase in construction loans. 
The 
 decrease from the fourth quarter of 2023 was primarily attributable to 
a 57.7 million decrease in consumer loans (primarily indirect 
 auto), a 30.6 million decline in commercial loans, and a 5.5 million 
decrease in commercial real estate loans, partially offset by 
a 
 22.2 million increase in residential real estate loans and a 22.8 million increase 
in construction real estate loans. 

 Without compromising our credit standards 
, 
changing our underwriting standards, or taking on inordinate interest rate risk, 
we 
 continue to closely monitor our markets and make minor adjustments as necessary. 
 Credit Quality
 Nonperforming assets (nonaccrual loans and other real estate) totaled 7.2 
million at September 30, 2024 compared to 6.2 million at 
 June 30, 2024 and 6.2 million at December 31, 2023. 
At September 30, 2024, nonperforming assets as a percent of total assets 
 equaled 0.17 , compared to 0.15 at June 30, 2024 and 0.15 at December 
31, 2023. 
Nonaccrual loans totaled 6.6 million at 
 September 30, 2024, a 1.1 million increase over June 30, 2024 and a 0.3 million increase over 
December 31, 2023. 
Further, 
 classified loans totaled 25.5 million at September 30, 2024, a 0.1 million 
decrease from June 30, 2024 and a 3.3 million increase 
 over December 31, 2023. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from 
the loans amortized cost basis to present the net amount 
 expected to be collected on the loans. 
The allowance for credit losses is adjusted by a credit loss provision which is reported in 
 earnings and reduced by the charge-off 
of loan amounts (net of recoveries). 
Loans are charged off against the allowance when 
 management believes the uncollectability of a loan balance is confirmed. 
Expected recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of amounts 
 previously charged-off and expected to be charged 
-off. 
Expected credit loss inherent in non-cancellable off-balance sheet credit 
 exposures is provided through the credit loss provision but recorded 
as a separate liability included in other liabilities. 
 Management estimates the allowance balance using relevant available 
information, from internal and external sources relating to past 
 events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. 
Historical loan default and loss experience provides the basis for 
 the estimation of expected credit losses. 
Adjustments to historical loss information incorporate management s 
view of current 
 conditions and forecasts. 

 At September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses for loans HFI totaled 
 29.8 million compared to 29.2 million at June 30, 2024 
 and 29.9 million at December 31, 2023. Activity within the allowance 
is provided in Note 3 Loans Held for Investment and 
 Allowance for Credit Losses in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
The increase in the allowance over June 30, 2024 was 
 primarily attributable to a slightly higher credit loss provision driven by a higher 
forecasted unemployment rate utilized in calculating 
 loan loss rates and loan grade migration (see above Provision for Credit Losses). 
The change in the allowance from December 31, 
 2023 reflected lower loan balances offset by higher 
loss rates and loan grade migration. 
At September 30, 2024, the allowance 
 represented 1.11 of loans HFI compared to 
1.09 at June 30, 2024, and 1.10 at December 31, 2023. 

43 
 At September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses for unfunded 
commitments totaled 2.5 million compared to 3.1 
million and 
 3.2 
million at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
The decline in the allowance from June 30, 2024 and December 
 31, 2023 reflected a lower level of unfunded loan commitments. The 
allowance for unfunded commitments is recorded in other 
 liabilities. 
 Deposits 
 Average total 
deposits were 3.572 billion for the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 69.0 million, 
or 1.9 , from the second quarter 
 of 2024 and an increase of 23.5 million, or 0.7 , over the fourth quarter 
of 2023. 
Compared to the second quarter of 2024, the 
 decrease was primarily attributable to lower NOW account balances primarily 
due to the seasonal decline in our public fund balances. 

 The increase over the fourth quarter of 2023 reflected growth in both money 
market and certificate of deposit balances which, 
 reflected a combination of balances migrating from savings and noninterest 
bearing accounts, in addition to receiving new deposits 
 from existing and new clients via various deposit strategies. 

 At September 30, 2024, total deposits were 3.579 billion, a decrease of 29.5 
million, or 0.8 , from June 30, 2024, and a decrease of 
 122.7 million, or 3.3 , from December 31, 2023. 
The decrease from June 30, 2024 was primarily due to lower noninterest bearing, 
 money market, and savings account balances. 
The decrease from December 31, 2023 was primarily due to lower NOW account 
 balances, primarily due to the seasonal decline in our public funds, partially 
offset by higher money market and certificate of deposit 
 balances from both new and existing clients. 
Total public funds balances 
were 516.2 million at September 30, 2024, 575.0 million 
 at June 30, 2024, and 709.8 million at December 31, 2023. 
 Business deposit transaction accounts classified as repurchase agreements 
averaged 27.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, an 
 increase of 0.1 million over the second quarter of 2024 and an increase of 0.3 
million over the fourth quarter of 2023. At September 
 30, 2024, repurchase agreement balances were 29.3 million compared 
to 22.5 million at June 30, 2024 and 27.0 million at 
 December 31, 2023. 

 We continue 
to closely monitor our cost of deposits and deposit mix as we manage through the current rate 
environment. 

 MARKET RISK AND INTEREST RATE 
SENSITIVITY
 Market Risk and Interest Rate Sensitivity 
 Overview.

Market risk arises from changes in interest rates, exchange rates, 
commodity prices, and equity prices. 
We have risk 
 management policies designed to monitor and limit exposure to market 
risk and we do not participate in activities that give rise to 
 significant market risk involving exchange rates, commodity prices, or 
equity prices. 
In asset and liability management activities, our 
 policies are designed to minimize structural interest rate risk.
 Interest Rate Risk Management.

Our net income is largely dependent on net interest income. 
Net interest income is susceptible to 
 interest rate risk to the degree that interest-bearing liabilities mature 
or reprice on a different basis than interest-earning assets. 
When 
 interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly 
than interest-earning assets in a given period, a significant increase in 
 market rates of interest could adversely affect net interest 
income. 
Similarly, when interest-earning 
assets mature or reprice more 
 quickly than interest-bearing liabilities, falling market interest rates could 
result in a decrease in net interest income. 
Net interest 
 income is also affected by changes in the portion of interest-earning 
assets that are funded by interest-bearing liabilities rather than by 
 other sources of funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and shareowners 
equity. 
 We have established 
what we believe to be a comprehensive interest rate risk management policy, 
which is administered by 
 management s Asset Liability Management 
Committee ALCO ). 
The policy establishes limits of risk, which are quantitative 
 measures of the percentage change in net interest income (a measure of net 
interest income at risk) and the fair value of equity capital 
 (a measure of economic value of equity EVE at risk) resulting from a hypothetical change 
in interest rates for maturities from one 
 day to 30 years. 
We measure the potential 
adverse impacts that changing interest rates may have on our short-term 
earnings, long-
 term value, and liquidity by employing simulation analysis through the use of 
computer modeling. 
The simulation model captures 
 optionality factors such as call features and interest rate caps and floors imbedded 
in investment and loan portfolio contracts. 
As with 
 any method of gauging interest rate risk, there are certain shortcomings 
inherent in the interest rate modeling methodology used by 
 us. 
When interest rates change, actual movements in different categories 
of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, loan 
 prepayments, and withdrawals of time and other deposits, may deviate significantly 
from assumptions used in the model. 
Finally, the 
 methodology does not measure or reflect the impact that higher rates may have 
on adjustable-rate loan clients ability to service their 
 debts, or the impact of rate changes on demand for loan and deposit products. 

44 
 The statement of financial condition is subject to testing for interest rate shock 
possibilities to indicate the inherent interest rate risk. 

 We apply instantaneous, 
parallel rate shocks to the base case in 100 basis point (bp) increments ranging from down 
400bp to up 
 400bps at least once per quarter, with the 
analysis reported to ALCO, our Market Risk Oversight Committee MROC ), 
our 
 Enterprise Risk Oversight Committee EROC and the Board of Directors. 
We augment our interest rate 
shock analysis with 
 alternative interest rate scenarios on a quarterly basis that may include ramps, 
and a flattening or steepening of the yield curve (non-
 parallel shift). 
In addition, more frequent forecasts may be produced when interest rates are particularly 
uncertain or when other 
 business conditions so dictate. 
 Our goal is to structure the statement of financial condition so that net interest earnings at risk over 
12-month and 24-month periods 
 and the economic value of equity at risk do not exceed policy guidelines 
at the various interest rate shock levels. We 
attempt to 
 achieve this goal by balancing, within policy limits, the volume of floating-rate 
liabilities with a similar volume of floating-rate assets, 
 by keeping the average maturity of fixed-rate asset and liability contracts 
reasonably matched, by managing the mix of our core 
 deposits, and by adjusting our rates to market conditions on a continuing 
basis. 

Analysis.

Measures of net interest income at risk produced by simulation analysis are 
indicators of an institution s short-term 
 performance in alternative rate environments. 
These measures are typically based upon a relatively brief period, and do not 
 necessarily indicate the long-term prospects or economic value of the institution.

 The Net Interest Income NII at Risk position of an instantaneous, 
parallel rate shock indicates that in the short-term (over the next 
 12 months), all rising rate environments will positively impact the net interest 
margin of the Company, 
while declining rate 
 environments 
will have a negative impact on the net interest margin. Compared 
to the second quarter of 2024, these metrics generally 
 became less favorable in the rising rate scenarios and more favorable 
in the falling rate scenarios. 
This was attributable to slightly 
 lower new volume asset rates, in addition to 50 million in investment purchases which 
provide a benefit in a falling rate environment, 
 with a negative effect in rising rate scenarios. 
The instantaneous, 
parallel rate shock results over the next 12-month and 24-month 
 periods are outside of policy in the rates down 300 bps and 400 bps scenario 
largely due to the limited ability to decrease deposit rates 
 the full extent of this rate change. 

 The measures of equity value at risk indicate our ongoing economic value 
by considering the effects of changes in interest rates on all 
 of our cash flows by discounting the cash flows to estimate the present value of 
assets and liabilities. The difference between these 
 discounted values of the assets and liabilities is the economic value of equity, 
which in theory approximates the fair value of our net 
 assets.

 At September 30, 2024, the economic value of equity was favorable 
in all rising rate environments and unfavorable in the falling rate 
 environments. Compared to the second quarter of 2024, EVE metrics were 
more favorable in the rising rate environment and less 
 favorable in falling rate environments as slower decay rates were assumed for 
our nonmaturity deposit portfolio, resulting in longer 
 assumed average lives. EVE is currently in compliance with policy in 
all rate scenarios as the EVE ratio exceeds the policy minimum 
 of 5.0 in each shock scenario. 
 As the interest rate environment and the dynamics of the economy continue to change, 
additional simulations will be analyzed to 
 address not only the changing rate environment, but also the change 
in mix of our financial assets and liabilities, measured over 
 multiple years, to help assess the risk to the Company. 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL 
RESOURCES 
 Liquidity 
 In general terms, liquidity is a measurement of our ability to meet our 
cash needs. 
Our objective in managing our liquidity is to 
 maintain our ability to meet loan commitments, purchase securities or repay deposits and 
other liabilities in accordance with their 
 terms, without an adverse impact on our current or future earnings. 
Our liquidity strategy is guided by policies that are formulated and 
 monitored by our ALCO and senior management, which take into account 
the marketability of assets, the sources and stability of 
 funding and the level of unfunded commitments. 
We regularly evaluate 
all of our various funding sources with an emphasis on 
 accessibility, stability, 
reliability and cost-effectiveness. 
Our principal source of funding has been our client deposits, supplemented 
 by our short-term and long-term borrowings, primarily from securities sold under 
repurchase agreements, federal funds purchased and 
 FHLB borrowings. 
We believe that the cash 
generated from operations, our borrowing capacity and our access to capital resources 
are 
 sufficient to meet our future operating capital and funding requirements. 

At September 30, 2024, we had the ability to generate approximately 1.522 
billion (excludes overnight funds position of 262 
 million) in additional liquidity through various sources including 
various federal funds purchased lines, Federal Home Loan Bank 
 borrowings, the Federal Reserve Discount Window, 
and brokered deposits. 
We recognize the 
importance of maintaining liquidity and 
 have developed a Contingent Liquidity Plan, which addresses various liquidity 
stress levels and our response and action based on the 
 level of severity. 
We periodically test our 
credit facilities for access to the funds, but also understand that as the severity of 
the 
 liquidity level increases that certain credit facilities may no longer be available. 
We conduct a liquidity 
stress test on a quarterly basis 
 based on events that could potentially occur at the Bank and report results to 
our ALCO, MROC, 
EROC, and Board of Directors. 
We 
 believe the liquidity available to us at September 30, 2024 was sufficient 
to meet our on-going needs and execute our business 
 strategy. 

We also view our 
investment portfolio as a liquidity source and have the option to pledge securities in our 
portfolio as collateral for 
 borrowings or deposits, and/or to sell selected securities. 
Additional information on our investment portfolio is provided within 
Note 
 2 Investment Securities. 
 The Bank maintained an average net overnight funds (i.e., deposits with banks plus 
FED funds sold less FED funds purchased) sold 
 position of 256.9 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 262.4 
million in the second quarter of 2024 and 99.8 million in 
 the fourth quarter of 2023. 
Compared to the second quarter of 2024, the decrease reflected lower average deposits (primarily 
seasonal 
 public funds) that was substantially offset by a decline in average loans. 
Compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, the increase was 
 primarily driven by higher average deposits and lower average investments. 

We expect our 
capital expenditures will be approximately 12.0 million over the next 12 months, 
which will primarily consist of 
 construction of new offices, office remodeling, 
office equipment/furniture, and technology purchases. 
Management expects that these 
 capital expenditures will be funded with existing resources without impairing 
our ability to meet our on-going obligations. 
 Borrowings 
 Average short 
-term borrowings totaled 29.8 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 
 33.6 million for the second quarter of 
 2024 
and 43.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. 
The decrease from both prior periods reflected a lower balance maintained on 
 CCHL s 
warehouse line. Additional detail on warehouse borrowings 
is provided in Note 4 Mortgage Banking Activities in the 
 Consolidated Financial Statements. 

46 
 We have issued two 
junior subordinated deferrable interest notes to our wholly owned 
Delaware statutory trusts. 
The first note for 
 30.9 million was issued to CCBG Capital Trust I in 
November 2004, of which 10 million was retired in April 2016. 
The second 
 note for 32.0 million was issued to CCBG Capital Trust II 
in May 2005. 
The interest payment for the CCBG Capital Trust I 
 borrowing is due quarterly and adjusts quarterly to a variable rate of three-month 
CME Term SOFR (secured overnight 
financing rate) 
 plus a margin of 1.90 . 
This note matures on December 31, 2034. 
The interest payment for the CCBG Capital Trust II borrowing 
is 
 due quarterly and adjusts quarterly to a variable interest rate based on three-month 
CME Term SOFR plus a margin 
of 1.80 . 
This 
 note matures on June 15, 2035. 
The proceeds from these borrowings were used to partially fund acquisitions. 
Under the terms of each 
 junior subordinated deferrable interest note, in the event of default or 
if we elect to defer interest on the note, we may not, with certain 
 exceptions, declare or pay dividends or make distributions on our capital 
stock or purchase or acquire any of our capital stock. 

 During the second quarter of 2020, we entered into a derivative cash 
flow hedge of our interest rate risk related to our subordinated 
 debt. 
The notional amount of the derivative is 30 million 10 million of the CCBG Capital Trust 
I borrowing and 20 million of the 
 CCBG Capital Trust II borrowing). 
The interest rate swap agreement requires CCBG to pay fixed and receive variable (three-month 
 CME Term SOFR plus spread) 
and has an average all-in fixed rate of 2.50 for 10 years. 
Additional detail on the interest rate swap 
 agreement is provided in Note 5 Derivatives in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements. 
 Capital 
 Our capital ratios are presented in the Selected Quarterly Financial Data 
table on page 34. 
At September 30, 2024, our regulatory 
 capital ratios exceeded the threshold to be designated as well-capitalized 
under the Basel III capital standards. 
 Shareowners equity was 476.5 million at September 30, 2024 
compared to 461.0 million at June 30, 2024 and 440.6 million at 
 December 31, 2023. 
For the first nine months of 2024, shareowners equity was positively impacted by net 
income attributable to 
 shareowners of 39.8 million, a 8.7 million decrease in the net unrealized 
loss on available for sale securities, net adjustments 
 totaling 0.9 million related to transactions under our stock compensation 
plans, and stock compensation accretion of 1.1 million. 

 Shareowners equity was reduced by a common stock dividend 
of 11.0 million 0.65 per share), the repurchase of 
common stock of 
 2.3 million (82,540 shares), a 0.6 million increase in the fair value of the interest 
rate swap related to subordinated debt, and a 0.7 
 million reclassification to temporary equity. 

 At September 30, 2024, our total risk-based capital ratio was 17.97 compared 
to 17.50 at June 30, 2024 and 16.57 at December 
 31, 2023. 
Our common equity tier 1 capital ratio was 14.88 , 14.44 , and 13.52 , respectively, 
on these dates. 
Our leverage ratio 
 was 10.89 , 10.51 , and 10.30 , respectively, 
on these dates. 
At September 30, 2024, all our regulatory capital ratios exceeded 
the 
 thresholds to be designated as well-capitalized under the Basel III capital 
standards. 
Further, our tangible common equity ratio 
 (non-GAAP financial measure) was 9.28 at September 30, 2024 compared to 8.91 
and 8.26 at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 
 2023, respectively. 
If our unrealized held-to-maturity securities losses of 12.9 million (after-tax) 
were recognized in accumulated 
 other comprehensive loss, our adjusted tangible capital ratio would be 9.00 . 
 Our tangible capital ratio is also impacted by the recording of our unfunded pension 
liability through other comprehensive income in 
 accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 
Topic 715. At September 30, 2024, 
the net pension liability reflected in other 
 comprehensive loss was 0.4 million compared to 0.4 million 
at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. This liability is re-measured 
 annually on December 31
 st
 
based on an actuarial calculation of our pension liability. 
Significant assumptions used in calculating the 
 liability include the weighted average discount rate used to measure the present 
value of the pension liability, 
the weighted average 
 expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, and the assumed rate of 
annual compensation increases, all of which will 
 vary when re-measured. The discount rate assumption used to calculate 
the pension liability is subject to long-term corporate bond 
 rates at December 31
 st
 . These assumptions and sensitivities are discussed in the section entitled Critical Accounting 
Policies and 
 Estimates in Part II, Item7. Management s 
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of 
our 2023 
 Form 10-K, as amended. 

 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
 We are a party 
to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risks in the normal 
course of business to meet the financing needs of our 
 clients. 

 At September 30, 2024, we had 714.2 million in commitments to extend 
credit and 6.1 million in standby letters of credit. 

 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a client so long as there is no violation of 
any condition established in the 
 contract. 
Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination 
clauses and may require payment of a fee. 
Since 
 many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, 
the total commitment amounts do not necessarily 
 represent future cash requirements. 
Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee 
the performance 
 of a client to a third party. 
We use the same credit 
policies in establishing commitments and issuing letters of credit as we do for on-
 balance sheet instruments. 

47 
 If commitments arising from these financial instruments continue to require 
funding at historical levels, management does not 
 anticipate that such funding will adversely impact our ability to meet our on-going 
obligations. 
In the event these commitments 
 require funding in excess of historical levels, management believes current 
liquidity, advances available from the 
FHLB and the 
 Federal Reserve, and investment security maturities provide a sufficient 
source of funds to meet these commitments. 
 Certain agreements provide that the commitments are unconditionally 
cancellable by the bank and for those agreements no allowance 
 for credit losses has been recorded. 

 We 
 have recorded an allowance for credit losses on loan commitments that are not 
 unconditionally cancellable by the Bank, which is included in other 
liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition 
 and totaled 2.5 million at September 30, 2024. 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements included in our 2023 Form 10-K, 
 as amended. 
The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements 
in accordance with GAAP and reporting practices applicable 
 to the banking industry requires us to make estimates and assumptions that 
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues 
 and expenses, and to disclose contingent assets and liabilities. 
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 We have identified 
accounting for (i) the allowance for credit losses, (ii) goodwill, 
(iii) pension assumptions, and (iv) income taxes as 
 our most critical accounting policies and estimates in that they are important 
to the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and 
 they require our subjective and complex judgment as a result of the need to make estimates about 
the effects of matters that are 
 inherently uncertain. 
These accounting policies, including the nature of the estimates and types of assumptions 
used, are described 
 throughout this Item 2, Management s 
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and 
Part II, Item 7, 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis 
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included 
in our 2023 Form 10-K, as 
 amended.

 Item 3. 
QUANTITATIVE 
AND QUALITATIVE 
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 See Market Risk and Interest Rate Sensitivity in Management s 
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
 Operations, above, which is incorporated herein by reference. 
Management has determined that no additional disclosures are 
 necessary to assess changes in information about market risk that have occurred 
since December 31, 2023. 
 Item 4. 
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 At September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, our management, 
including our Chief Executive Officer and 
 Chief Financial Officer, evaluated 
the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined 
in Rule 13a-15(e) under the 
 Securities Exchange Act of 1934). 
Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer concluded 
 that, as of the end of the period covered by this report our disclosure controls and procedures 
were ineffective due to the identification 
 of the material weakness discussed below. 
 Previously Reported Material Weakness 
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, 
or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such 
that there is a 
 reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s 
annual interim financial statements will not be prevented or 
 detected on a timely basis. 
As reported in our 2023 Form 10-K, as amended, we did not maintain effective 
internal control over 
 financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934) as of December 31, 2023 as 
 a result of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting 
for the review of significant inter-company mortgage 
 loan sales and servicing transactions was not designed effectively. 
Specifically, management s 
review control over the completeness 
 and accuracy of elimination entries in the consolidation process was not designed 
effectively, as the 
review was not sufficiently 
 precise to identify all the necessary elimination entries between CCB and its subsidiary, 
CCHL. The Company determined inter-
 company transactions related to the sale of residential mortgage loans were 
not properly eliminated and net loan fees were not 
 properly recorded. Further, financial information 
obtained from CCHL for certain construction/permanent loan activity was not in 
 sufficient detail to appropriately classify this activity within the 
Statement of Cash Flows. 
Specifically, management s 
review control 
 over the completeness, accuracy and review of financial information provided 
from CCHL related to the Statement of Cash Flows was 
 not designed effectively as the review was not sufficiently 
precise to identify all errors in financial reporting. Refer to our 2023 Form 
 10-K, as amended, for further information on the material weakness. 
 Remediation Plan 
 Since identifying the material weakness described above, management, 
with oversight from the Audit Committee and input from the 
 Board of Directors, has devoted substantial resources to the ongoing 
implementation of remediation efforts. These remediation 
efforts, 
 summarized below are intended to address both the identified material weakness 
and to enhance the Company s overall 
internal 
 control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. 
Based on additional procedures and post-closing review, 
 management concluded that the consolidated financial statements 
included in this report present fairly, 
in all material respects, our 
 financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented, 
in conformity with GAAP. 
 The internal control and procedural enhancements and remedial actions that 
have been implemented include: 
 1.
 Enhance the precision level review of activity within existing accounts that are 
subject to elimination during consolidation, to 
 ensure appropriate elimination; 

 2.
 Enhance review procedures to identify new inter-company 
accounts and activities subject to elimination during 
 consolidation; 

 3.
 Increase the granularity of general ledger mapping for inter-company 
accounts subject to elimination during consolidation; 

 4.
 Enhance financial close checklist and pre-close meeting agenda to assist the reviewer 
identifying and assessing inter-
 company activities that are subject to elimination in a timely manner; and 
 5.
 Enhance the detail of review procedures of financial information obtained 
from a subsidiary 
to identify, assess and validate 
 appropriate classification when preparing the consolidated financial statements, 
including when reviewing items in the 
 operating, investing or financing activity sections within the Statement of 
Cash Flow. 
 To remediate 
the material weakness, the Company implemented the internal control and procedural enhancements 
noted above in 
 items 1-4 during the fourth quarter of 2023 and implemented the enhancement 
noted above in item 5 during the first quarter of 2024. 

 The material weakness cannot be considered remediated until the applicable 
controls have operated for a sufficient period of time and 
 management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are designed 
and operating effectively. 
Accordingly, management 
will 
 continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our 
internal control over financial reporting and the disclosure controls and 
 procedures. 

50 
 Change in Internal Control 
 Except as identified above with respect to remediation of the material weakness 
, 
there have been no significant changes in our internal 
 control over financial reporting during our most recently completed fiscal 
quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably 
 likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
 PART 
II. 
OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. 
Legal Proceedings 
 We are party 
to lawsuits arising out of the normal course of business. 
In management's opinion, there is no known pending litigation, 
 the outcome of which would, individually or in the aggregate, have a material effect 
on our consolidated results of operations, 
 financial position, or cash flows.
