Table of Contents 
 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Some of the information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). All statements, other than statements of historical fact included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, regarding our strategy, future operations, financial position, estimated revenues and losses, projected costs, prospects, plans and objectives of management are forward-looking statements. Words such as may, assume, forecast, position, predict, strategy, expect, intend, plan, estimate, anticipate, believe, project, budget, potential, or continue, and similar expressions are used to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain such identifying words. When considering these forward-looking statements, investors should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. These forward-looking statements are based on management s current beliefs, based on currently available information, as to the outcome and timing of future events. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by such forward-looking statements include: our ability to execute our business strategy; our production and natural gas, natural gas liquids NGLs and oil reserves; our financial strategy, liquidity and capital required for our development program; 
 our ability to obtain debt or equity financing on satisfactory terms to fund acquisitions, expansion projects, working capital requirements and the repayment or refinancing of indebtedness; our ability to execute our return of capital program; 
 natural gas, NGLs and oil prices; impacts of geopolitical events, including the conflicts in Ukraine and in the Middle East, and world health events; timing and amount of future production of natural gas, NGLs and oil; our hedging strategy and results; our ability to meet minimum volume commitments and to utilize or monetize our firm transportation commitments; our future drilling plans; our projected well costs; competition; government regulations and changes in laws; pending legal or environmental matters; marketing of natural gas, NGLs and oil; leasehold or business acquisitions; costs of developing our properties; operations of Antero Midstream Corporation Antero Midstream our ability to achieve our greenhouse gas reduction targets and the costs associated therewith; general economic conditions; credit markets;

 uncertainty regarding our future operating results; and our other plans, objectives, expectations and intentions contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 We caution investors that these forward-looking statements are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties incidental to our business, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. These risks include, but are not limited to, commodity price volatility, inflation, supply chain or other disruption, availability and cost of drilling, completion and production equipment and services, environmental risks, drilling and completion and other operating risks, marketing and transportation risks, regulatory changes or changes in law, the uncertainty inherent in estimating natural gas, NGLs and oil reserves and in projecting future rates of production, cash flows and access to capital, the timing of development expenditures, conflicts of interest among our stockholders, impacts of geopolitical and world health events, cybersecurity risks, the state of markets for, and availability of, verified quality carbon offsets and the other risks described or referenced under the heading Item 1A. Risk Factors herein, including the risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Form 10-K ), which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). Reserve engineering is a process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas, NGLs and oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data, the interpretation of such data, and the price and cost assumptions made by reservoir engineers. In addition, the results of drilling, testing and production activities, or changes in commodity prices, may justify revisions of estimates that were made previously. If significant, such revisions would change the schedule of any further production and development drilling. Accordingly, reserve estimates may differ significantly from the quantities of natural gas, NGLs and oil that are ultimately recovered. Should one or more of the risks or uncertainties described or referenced in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q occur, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results and plans could differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements, expressed or implied, included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. This cautionary statement should also be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements that we or persons acting on our behalf may issue. Except as otherwise required by applicable law, we disclaim any duty to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

The exercise of the lease renewal options is at the Company s sole discretion. The depreciable lives of the leased assets are limited by the expected lease term, unless there is a transfer of title or purchase option reasonably certain of exercise. Certain of the Company s lease agreements include minimum payments based on a percentage of produced volumes over contractual levels and others include rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation. The Company considers all contracts that have assets specified in the contract, either explicitly or implicitly, that the Company has substantially all of the capacity of the asset, and has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits of that asset, without the lessor s ability to have a substantive right to substitute that asset, as leased assets. For any contract deemed to include a leased asset, that asset is capitalized on the balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability is recorded at the present value of the known future minimum payments of the contract using a discount rate on the date of commencement. The leased asset classification is determined at the date of recording as either operating or financing, depending upon certain criteria of the contract. The discount rate used for present value calculations is the discount rate implicit in the contract. If an implicit rate is not determinable, a collateralized incremental borrowing rate is used at the date of commencement. As new leases commence or previous leases are modified the discount rate used in the present value calculation is the current period applicable discount rate. The Company has made an accounting policy election to adopt the practical expedient for combining lease and non-lease components on an asset class basis. This expedient allows the Company to combine non-lease components such as real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses associated with the leased premises with the lease component of a lease agreement on an asset class basis when the non-lease components of the agreement cannot be easily bifurcated from the lease payment. Currently, the Company is only applying this expedient to certain office space agreements.

Substantially all of the Company s production revenues are attributable to customers located in the United States; however, some of the Company s production revenues are attributable to customers who then transport the Company s production to foreign countries for resale or consumption. These segments are monitored separately by management for performance and are consistent with internal financial reporting. These segments have been identified based on the differing products and services, regulatory environment and the expertise required for these operations. Management evaluates the performance of the Company s business segments based on operating income (loss). General and administrative expenses were allocated to the midstream segment based on the nature of the expenses and on a combination of the segments proportionate share of the Company s consolidated property and equipment, capital expenditures and labor costs, as applicable.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. We caution that assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions or beliefs about future events may, and often do, vary from actual results, and the differences can be material. Some of the key factors that could cause actual results to vary from our expectations include changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices, the timing of planned capital expenditures, our ability to fund our development programs, uncertainties in estimating proved reserves and forecasting production results, operational factors affecting the commencement or maintenance of producing wells, the condition of the capital markets generally, as well as our ability to access them, impacts of world health events and uncertainties regarding environmental regulations or litigation and other legal or regulatory developments affecting our business, as well as those factors discussed below, all of which are difficult to predict. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed may not occur. See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. Also, see the risk factors and other cautionary statements described under the heading Item 1A. Risk Factors. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements except as otherwise required by applicable law.

Our Company We are an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the development, production, exploration and acquisition of natural gas, NGLs and oil properties located in the Appalachian Basin. We focus on unconventional reservoirs, which can generally be characterized as fractured shale formations. Our management team has worked together for many years and has a successful track record of reserve and production growth as well as significant expertise in unconventional resource plays. Our strategy is to leverage our team s experience delineating and developing natural gas resource plays to develop our reserves and production, primarily on our existing multi-year inventory of drilling locations. We have assembled a portfolio of long-lived properties that are characterized by what we believe to be low geologic risk and repeatability. Our drilling opportunities are focused in the Appalachian Basin. As of September 30, 2024, we held approximately 519,000 net acres in the Appalachian Basin. Financing Highlights Unsecured Credit Facility During the second quarter of 2024, we achieved an investment grade credit rating from S P Global Inc. As a result of this investment grade credit rating, on July 30, 2024, we entered into an amended and restated senior revolving credit facility with lender commitments of 1.65 billion that matures on July 30, 2029, subject to certain extension terms and conditions. Borrowings under the amended and restated facility are unsecured and are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries. See Note 7 Long-Term Debt to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for more information. Market Conditions and Business Trends Commodity Markets Prices for natural gas, NGLs and oil that we produce significantly impact our revenues and cash flows. Benchmark prices for natural gas decreased significantly, while benchmark prices for oil remained consistent and benchmark prices for NGLs increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023. As a result of the lower benchmark natural gas prices and higher benchmark NGLs prices in 2024, we experienced a decrease in price realizations for natural gas and ethane products and an increase in price realization for NGLs products during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. We monitor the economic factors that impact natural gas, NGLs and oil prices, including domestic and foreign supply and demand indicators, domestic and foreign commodity inventories, the actions of Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other large producing nations and the current conflicts in Ukraine and in the Middle East, among others. In the current economic environment, we expect that commodity prices for some or all of the commodities we produce could remain volatile. This volatility is beyond our control and may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and future cash flows.

 Hedge Position Antero Resources (Excluding Martica) We are exposed to certain commodity price risks relating to our ongoing business operations, and we use derivative instruments when circumstances warrant to manage such risks. In addition, we periodically enter into contracts that contain embedded features that are required to be bifurcated and accounted for separately as derivatives. Due to our improved liquidity and leverage position as compared to historical levels, the percentage of our expected production that we hedge has decreased. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, substantially all of our production was unhedged. The tables and narrative below exclude derivative instruments attributable to Martica, our consolidated VIE, since all gains or losses from such contracts are fully attributable to the noncontrolling interests in Martica. As of September 30, 2024, our fixed price NGLs swap positions excluding Martica were as follows:

 As of September 30, 2024, the estimated fair value of our commodity derivative contracts, excluding Martica, was a net liability of 24 million. See Note 11 Derivative Instruments to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for more information. Martica Our consolidated VIE, Martica, also maintains a portfolio of fixed swap natural gas, NGLs and oil derivatives for the benefit of the noncontrolling interests in Martica. As such, all gains and losses attributable to Martica s derivative portfolio are fully attributable to the noncontrolling interests in Martica.

Economic Indicators The economy experienced elevated inflation levels as a result of global supply and demand imbalances, where global demand outpaced supplies beginning in 2021 and continuing through the third quarter of 2024. For example, the Consumer Price Index CPI for all urban consumers increased 3.7 from September 2022 to September 2023 and an additional 2.4 from September 2023 to September 2024 as compared to the Federal Reserve s stated goal of 2 . In order to manage the inflation risk present in the United States economy, the Federal Reserve utilized monetary policy in the form of interest rate increases beginning in March 2022 in an effort to bring the inflation rate in line with its stated goal of 2 on a long-term basis. Between March 2022 and July 2023, the Federal Reserve increased the federal funds interest rate by 5.25 . During the three months ended September 30, 2024, inflation rates began to approach the Federal Reserve s stated goal of 2 , and the Federal Reserve decreased the federal funds rate by 0.5 in September 2024. While inflationary pressures in the United States economy have begun to subside, we continue to be impacted by the increased federal funds interest rate. See Results of Operations for more information. The economy also continues to be impacted by the effects of global events. These events have often caused global supply chain disruptions with additional pressure due to trade sanctions on Russia and other global trade restrictions, among others. However, our supply chain has not experienced any significant interruptions as a result of such events. Inflationary pressures, particularly as they relate to certain of our long-term contracts with CPI-based adjustments, and supply chain disruptions have and could continue to result in increases to our operating and capital costs that are not fixed. These economic variables are beyond our control and may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and future cash flows.

 Results of Operations We have three operating segments: (i) the exploration, development and production of natural gas, NGLs and oil; (ii) marketing and utilization of excess firm transportation capacity; and (iii) midstream services through our equity method investment in Antero Midstream. Revenues from Antero Midstream s operations were primarily derived from intersegment transactions for services provided to our exploration and production operations by Antero Midstream . All intersegment transactions were eliminated upon consolidation, including revenues from water handling services provided by Antero Midstream , which we capitalized as proved property development costs. Marketing revenues are primarily derived from activities to purchase and sell third-party natural gas and NGLs and to market and utilize excess firm transportation capacity. See Note 16 Reportable Segments to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for more information. Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 The operating results of our reportable segments were as follows (in thousands):

 Not meaningful (1) Production data excludes volumes related to the VPP. (2) Oil and NGLs production was converted at 6 Mcf per Bbl to calculate total Bcfe production and per Mcfe amounts. This ratio is an estimate of the equivalent energy content of the products and may not reflect their relative economic value. (3) Average prices reflect the before and after effects of our settled commodity derivatives. Our calculation of such after effects includes gains (losses) on settlements of commodity derivatives, which do not qualify for hedge accounting because we do not designate or document them as hedges for accounting purposes. (4) The average realized price for the three months ended September 30, 2023 includes 6 million of proceeds related to a take-or-pay contract. Excluding the effect of these proceeds, the average realized price for ethane before and after the effects of derivatives for the three months ended September 30, 2023 would have been 10.88 per Bbl. Natural gas sales . Revenues from sales of natural gas decreased from 516 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 426 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 90 million, or 18 . Lower commodity prices (excluding the effects of derivative settlements) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 accounted for an approximate 69 million decrease in year-over-year natural gas sales revenue (calculated as the change in the year-to-year average price times current year production volumes). Lower natural gas production volumes accounted for an approximate 21 million decrease in year-over-year natural gas sales revenue (calculated as the change in year-to-year volumes times the prior year average price). NGLs sales . Revenues from sales of NGLs increased from 483 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 504 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 21 million, or 4 . Higher commodity prices (excluding the effects of derivative settlements) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 accounted for an approximate 21 million increase in year-over-year revenues (calculated as the change in the year-to-year average price times current year production volumes).

 Oil sales . Revenues from sales of oil decreased from 63 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 53 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 10 million, or 16 . Lower commodity prices (excluding the effects of derivative settlements) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 accounted for an approximate 6 million decrease in year-over-year revenues (calculated as the change in the year-to-year average price times current year production volumes). Lower oil production volumes during the three months ended September 30, 2024 accounted for an approximate 4 million decrease in year-over-year oil revenues (calculated as the change in year-to-year volumes times the prior year average price). Commodity derivative fair value gains. Our commodity derivatives included fixed price swap contracts, basis swap contracts, call options and embedded put options. Because we do not designate these derivatives as accounting hedges, they do not receive hedge accounting treatment. Consequently, all mark-to-market gains or losses, as well as cash receipts or payments on settled derivative instruments, are recognized in our statements of operations and comprehensive income. For the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, our commodity hedges resulted in derivative fair value gains of 3 million and 18 million, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, commodity derivative fair value gains included 6 million of cash payments on settled commodity derivative losses. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, commodity derivative fair value gains included 4 million of net cash proceeds on settled commodity derivatives gains. Commodity derivative fair value gains or losses vary based on future commodity prices and have no cash flow impact until the derivative contracts are settled or monetized prior to settlement. Derivative asset or liability positions at the end of any accounting period may reverse to the extent future commodity prices increase or decrease from their levels at the end of the accounting period, or as gains or losses are realized through settlement. We expect continued volatility in commodity prices and the related fair value of our derivative instruments in the future. Amortization of deferred revenue, VPP. Amortization of deferred revenues associated with the VPP decreased from 8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 1 million, or 12 , primarily due to lower production volumes attributable to the VPP properties between periods. Amortization of the deferred revenues associated with the VPP are recognized as the production volumes are delivered at 1.61 per MMBtu over the contractual term. Lease operating expense . Lease operating expense decreased from 33 million, or 0.10 per Mcfe, for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 30 million, or 0.09 per Mcfe, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 3 million primarily due to lower water disposal costs and workover expense between periods. Gathering, compression, processing and transportation expense. Gathering, compression, processing and transportation expense increased from 672 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 685 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 13 million, or 2 . This was primarily a result of the following: Gathering and compression costs increased from 0.68 per Mcfe for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 0.72 per Mcfe for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the expiration of the growth incentive fee rebate program on December 31, 2023 and annual CPI-based adjustments between periods. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we earned a fee rebate of 12 million under this program. Processing costs increased from 0.83 per Mcfe for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 0.88 per Mcfe for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to increased costs for NGLs processing, which includes an annual CPI-based adjustment during the first quarter of 2024 and higher NGLs transportation fees. Transportation costs decreased from 0.60 per Mcfe for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 0.58 per Mcfe for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to lower demand fees, as well as lower fuel costs as a result of lower natural gas prices between periods. 
 Production and ad valorem tax expense. Production and ad valorem taxes increased from 32 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 47 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 15 million, or 47 , primarily due to higher ad valorem taxes, partially offset by lower natural gas prices during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Production and ad valorem taxes as a percentage of natural gas revenues increased from 6 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 11 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily as a result of higher ad valorem taxes, which 2024 ad valorem taxes are based on commodity prices during 2022.

 General and administrative expense . General and administrative expense (excluding equity-based compensation expense) decreased slightly from 40 million, or 0.13 per Mcfe, for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 39 million, or 0.12 per Mcfe for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily as a result of lower pipeline bond and leased vehicle costs between periods . Equity-based compensation expense . Non-cash equity-based compensation expense decreased from 18 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 16 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 2 million, or 13 . This decrease was primarily due to lower PSU award expense between periods, partially offset by increased RSU award expense attributable to awards granted in the first quarter of 2024. See Note 9 Equity-Based Compensation to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for more information. Depletion, depreciation, and amortization expense DD A expense . DD A expense decreased from 176 million, or 0.55 per Mcfe, for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 170 million, or 0.55 per Mcfe, for the three months ended September 30 2024, a decrease of 6 million, or 3 . The decrease in total DD A expense is primarily due to lower production volumes between periods. Impairment of property and equipment . Impairment of oil and gas properties remained consistent at 13 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024. During both periods, we recognized impairments primarily related to expiring leases as well as design and initial costs related to pads we no longer plan to place into service. Contract termination, loss contingency, settlements and other operating expenses . Contract termination, loss contingency, settlements and other operating expenses was a loss of 14 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a loss contingency. Contract termination, loss contingency, settlements and other operating expenses was a gain of 1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to our receipt of 0.1 million shares of Antero Midstream common stock as part of a judgment in a legal proceeding with an unaffiliated third-party. Marketing Segment Where feasible, we purchase and sell third-party natural gas and NGLs and market our excess firm transportation capacity, or engage third parties to conduct these activities on our behalf, in order to optimize the revenues from these transportation agreements. We have entered into long-term firm transportation agreements for a significant portion of our current and expected future production in order to secure guaranteed capacity to favorable markets. Net marketing expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024 remained relatively consistent at 17 million and 15 million, respectively, or 0.05 per Mcfe. Marketing revenue. Marketing revenue decreased from 53 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 47 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 6 million, or 11 . This fluctuation primarily resulted from the following: Natural gas marketing revenue decreased by 14 million between periods primarily due to lower natural gas marketing volumes and prices between periods. Lower natural gas marketing volumes accounted for an 11 million decrease in year-over-year marketing revenues (calculated as the change in year-to-year volumes times the prior year average price), and lower natural gas prices accounted for a 3 million decrease in year-over-year marketing revenues (calculated as the change in the year-to-year average price times current year marketing volumes). Oil marketing revenue increased by 8 million between periods primarily due to higher oil marketing volumes, partially offset by lower oil prices. Higher oil marketing volumes accounted for a 10 million increase in year-over-year marketing revenues (calculated as the change in year-to-year volumes times the prior year average price), and lower oil prices accounted for a 2 million decrease in year-over-year marketing revenues (calculated as the change in the year-to-year average price times current year marketing volumes). 
 Marketing expense. Marketing expense decreased from 70 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 62 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 8 million, or 11 . Marketing expense includes the cost of third-party purchased natural gas, NGLs and oil as well as firm transportation costs, including costs related to current excess firm capacity. The cost of third-party natural gas, oil and NGLs purchases remained consistent at 43 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024. Firm transportation costs were 26 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 18 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 8 million due to the reduction in firm transportation commitments and higher third-party marketing volumes between periods.

 Antero Midstream Segment Antero Midstream revenue. Revenue from the Antero Midstream segment increased from 264 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 270 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 6 million. This increase is primarily due to higher gathering and processing revenues of 20 million, partially offset by lower water handling revenues of 14 million. The increased gathering and processing revenues between periods is primarily a result of the expiration of the growth incentive fee rebate program on December 31, 2023, annual CPI-based gathering and compression rate adjustments and increased high pressure gathering throughput between periods. The decreased water handling revenues between periods was primarily due to lower fresh water delivery and other fluid handling volumes, partially offset by an increased fresh water delivery rate due to an annual CPI-based adjustment during the first quarter of 2024. Antero Midstream operating expense. Total operating expense related to the Antero Midstream segment increased from 102 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 107 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 5 million. This increase is primarily due to higher general and administrative expense, including equity-based compensation expense, and depreciation expense between periods.

Interest expense decreased from 32 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 28 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 4 million, or 11 , primarily due to the conversion of 26 million aggregate principal amount of our 2026 Convertible Notes during the first quarter of 2024 and lower benchmark interest rates during the three months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by higher average Credit Facility borrowings between periods. Income tax expense . For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had an income tax expense of 14 million, with an effective tax rate of 30 , due to income before income taxes of 46 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had an income tax expense of 1 million from a loss before income taxes of 9 million primarily due to the net loss before income taxes during the third quarter of 2024, which when taken together with the net loss before taxes during the six months ended June 30, 2024, resulted in a 9 effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Not meaningful (1) Production data excludes volumes related to the VPP. (2) Oil and NGLs production was converted at 6 Mcf per Bbl to calculate total Bcfe production and per Mcfe amounts. This ratio is an estimate of the equivalent energy content of the products and may not reflect their relative economic value. (3) Average prices reflect the before and after effects of our settled commodity derivatives. Our calculation of such after effects includes gains (losses) on settlements of commodity derivatives (but do not include payments from the derivative monetizations in 2023), which do not qualify for hedge accounting because we do not designate or document them as hedges for accounting purposes. (4) The average realized price for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024 includes 13 million and 2 million, respectively, of proceeds related to a take-or-pay contract. Excluding the effect of these proceeds, the average realized price for ethane before and after the effects of derivatives for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024 would have been 9.77 per Bbl and 8.48 per Bbl, respectively. Natural gas sales . Revenues from sales of natural gas decreased from 1.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 1.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 0.3 billion, or 21 . Lower commodity prices (excluding the effects of derivative settlements) during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 accounted for an approximate 323 million decrease in year-over-year natural gas sales revenue (calculated as the change in the year-to-year average price times current year production volumes). Lower natural gas production volumes accounted for an approximate 24 million decrease in year-over-year natural gas sales revenue (calculated as the change in year-to-year volumes times the prior year average price). NGLs sales . Revenues from sales of NGLs increased from 1.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 1.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 0.1 billion, or 10 . Higher commodity prices (excluding the effects of derivative settlements) during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 accounted for an approximate 76 million increase in year-over-year revenues (calculated as the change in the year-to-year average price times current year production volumes). Higher NGLs production volumes accounted for an approximate 60 million increase in year-over-year NGLs revenues (calculated as the change in year-to-year volumes times the prior year average price).

 Oil sales . Revenues from sales of oil increased from 172 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 181 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 9 million, or 5 . Higher oil prices, excluding the effects of derivative settlements, accounted for an approximate 1 million increase in year-over-year oil revenues (calculated as the change in the year-to-year average price times current year production volumes). Higher oil production volumes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 accounted for an approximate 8 million increase in year-over-year oil revenues (calculated as the change in year-to-year volumes times the prior year average price). Commodity derivative fair value gains. Our commodity derivatives included variable price swap contracts, swaptions, basis swap contracts, call options and embedded put options. Because we do not designate these derivatives as accounting hedges, they do not receive hedge accounting treatment. Consequently, all mark-to-market gains or losses, as well as cash receipts or payments on settled derivative instruments, are recognized in our statements of operations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, our commodity hedges resulted in derivative fair value gains of 138 million and 22 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, commodity derivative fair value gains included 17 million of cash payments on settled commodity derivative losses and a 202 million cash payment for the early settlement of our swaption. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, commodity derivative fair value gains included 12 million of net cash proceeds for settled derivative gains. Commodity derivative fair value gains or losses vary based on future commodity prices and have no cash flow impact until the derivative contracts are settled or monetized prior to settlement. Derivative asset or liability positions at the end of any accounting period may reverse to the extent future commodity prices increase or decrease from their levels at the end of the accounting period, or as gains or losses are realized through settlement. Additionally, substantially all of our production is currently unhedged for 2024 and beyond, which limits our exposure to volatility in the fair value of our derivative instruments related to commodity price changes in the future. Amortization of deferred revenue, VPP. Amortization of deferred revenues associated with the VPP decreased from 23 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 20 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 3 million or 11 , primarily due to lower production volumes attributable to the VPP properties between periods. Amortization of the deferred revenues associated with the VPP are recognized as the production volumes are delivered at 1.61 per MMBtu over the contractual term. Lease operating expense . Lease operating expense decreased from 92 million, or 0.10 per Mcfe, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 88 million, or 0.09 per Mcfe, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to lower water disposal costs and workover expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by higher oilfield service costs between periods. Gathering, compression, processing and transportation expense. Gathering, compression, processing and transportation expense remained consistent at 2.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024. This was primarily a result of the following: Gathering and compression costs on a per unit basis increased from 0.69 per Mcfe for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 0.72 per Mcfe for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the expiration of the growth incentive fee rebate program on December 31, 2023 and annual CPI-based adjustments between periods. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we earned fee rebates of 36 million under this program. Processing costs on a per unit basis increased from 0.83 per Mcfe for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 0.86 per Mcfe for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to increased costs for NGLs processing and transportation, which includes an annual CPI-based adjustment during the first quarter of 2024 and higher NGLs transportation fees. Transportation costs on a per unit basis decreased from 0.62 per Mcfe for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 0.58 per Mcfe for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to lower demand fees and lower fuel costs as a result of lower natural gas prices between periods. 
 Production and ad valorem tax expense. Production and ad valorem taxes increased from 118 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 148 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 30 million, or 25 , primarily due to higher ad valorem taxes and production volumes between periods, partially offset by lower natural gas prices during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Production and ad valorem taxes as a percentage of natural gas revenues increased from 7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 12 for the nine months ended September 30,

Table of Contents 
 2024, primarily as a result of higher ad valorem taxes, which 2024 West Virginia ad valorem taxes are based on commodity prices during 2022. General and administrative expense . General and administrative expense (excluding equity-based compensation expense) decreased from 125 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 121 million for nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 4 million, or 3 , primarily due to lower professional service fees between periods. General and administrative expense on a per unit basis (excluding equity-based compensation) remained consistent at 0.13 per Mcfe for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024. Equity-based compensation expense . Non-cash equity-based compensation expense increased from 45 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 49 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 4 million, or 10 . This increase was primarily due to RSU award expense attributable to awards granted in the fourth quarter of 2023 and first quarter of 2024, partially offset by lower PSU award expense between periods and equity-based awards granted in prior years that were fully vested between periods. See Note 9 Equity-Based Compensation to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for more information. Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense. DD A expense remained relatively consistent at 515 million, or 0.56 per Mcfe, and 514 million, or 0.55 per Mcfe, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. Impairment of property and equipment . Impairment of oil and gas properties decreased from 45 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 19 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 26 million, primarily due to lower impairments of expiring leases between periods. During both periods, we recognized impairments primarily related to expiring leases as well as design and initial costs related to pads we no longer plan to place into service. Contract termination, loss contingency, settlements and other operating expenses . Contract termination, loss contingency, settlements and other operating expenses attributable to our exploration and production segment decreased from 24 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This decrease was primarily due to a loss contingency recorded in the third quarter of 2023 and lower expense associated with the early termination of certain completion contracts between periods, partially offset by our receipt of 0.1 million shares of Antero Midstream common stock during the third quarter of 2024 as part of a judgment in a legal proceeding with an unaffiliated third-party. Marketing Segment Where feasible, we purchase and sell third-party natural gas and NGLs and market our excess firm transportation capacity, or engage third parties to conduct these activities on our behalf, in order to optimize the revenues from these transportation agreements. We have entered into long-term firm transportation agreements for a significant portion of our current and expected future production in order to secure guaranteed capacity to favorable markets. Net marketing expense decreased from 62 million, or 0.07 per Mcfe, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 48 million, or 0.05 per Mcfe, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to lower firm transportation commitments between periods. M arketing revenue. Marketing revenue decreased from 155 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 145 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 10 million, or 7 . This fluctuation primarily resulted from the following: Natural gas marketing revenue decreased by 59 million between periods primarily due to lower natural gas marketing volumes and prices. Lower natural gas marketing volumes accounted for a 50 million decrease in year-over-year marketing revenues (calculated as the change in year-to-year volumes times the prior year average price), and lower natural gas prices accounted for a 9 million decrease in year-over-year marketing revenues (calculated as the change in the year-to-year average price times current year marketing volumes). Oil marketing revenue increased by 45 million between periods primarily due to higher oil marketing volumes and prices. Higher oil marketing volumes accounted for a 35 million increase in year-over-year marketing revenues (calculated as the change in year-to-year volumes times the prior year average price), and higher oil prices accounted for a 10 million increase in year-over-year marketing revenues (calculated as the change in the year-to-year average price times current year marketing volumes).

Table of Contents 
 NGLs marketing revenues were 4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. There were no NGLs marketing revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Marketing expense. Marketing expense decreased from 217 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 193 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 24 million, or 11 . Marketing expense includes the cost of third-party purchased natural gas, NGLs and oil as well as firm transportation costs, including costs related to current excess firm capacity. The cost of third-party natural gas purchases decreased 47 million between periods, partially offset by increased oil and NGLs purchases of 38 million and 4 million, respectively. The total cost of third-party commodity purchases decreased primarily due to lower natural gas marketing volumes and prices between periods, partially offset by higher oil prices and marketing volumes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Firm transportation costs decreased 19 million from 82 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 63 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the reduction in firm transportation commitments between periods. Contract termination, loss contingency, settlements and other operating expenses . Contract termination, loss contingency, settlements and other operating expenses attributable to our marketing segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, relate to a 24 million payment for the early termination of our firm transportation commitment of 200,000 MMBtu per day on the Equitrans pipeline. Our marketing segment did not incur any contract termination, loss contingency, settlements and other operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Antero Midstream Segment Antero Midstream revenue. Revenue from the Antero Midstream segment increased from 782 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 819 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 37 million. This increase is primarily due to higher gathering and processing revenues of 66 million, partially offset by lower water handling revenues of 29 million. The increased gathering and processing revenues between periods is primarily a result of the expiration of the growth incentive fee rebate program on December 31, 2023, increased throughput and annual CPI-based gathering and compression rate adjustments between periods. The decreased water handling revenues between periods is primarily due to lower fresh water delivery volumes and lower water handling volumes that are billed at cost plus 3 , partially offset by higher blending volumes and an increased fresh water delivery rate due to an annual CPI-based adjustment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Antero Midstream operating expense. Total operating expense related to the Antero Midstream segment increased from 325 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 337 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 12 million. This increase is primarily due to higher general and administrative expense, including equity-based compensation expense, and depreciation expense between periods as well as lower gains on asset sale during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Items Not Allocated to Segments Interest expense. Interest expense increased from 85 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 91 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 6 million or 7 , primarily due to higher average Credit Facility borrowings between periods and higher benchmark interest rates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Income tax expense (benefit) . For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had income tax expense of 46 million, with an effective tax rate of 17 , related to our income before income taxes of 272 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had an income tax benefit of 2 million, with an effective tax rate of 9 , related to our loss before income taxes of 25 million. The decrease in the effective tax rate between periods was primarily due to the effects of noncontrolling interests and our loss before income taxes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Capital Resources and Liquidity Sources and Uses of Cash Our primary sources of liquidity have been through net cash provided by operating activities, borrowings under our Credit Facility, issuances of debt and equity securities and additional contributions from our asset sales, including our drilling partnership . Our primary use of cash has been for the exploration, development and acquisition of oil and natural gas properties. As we develop our reserves, we continually monitor what capital resources, including equity and debt financings, are available to meet our future financial obligations, planned capital expenditure activities and liquidity requirements. Our future success in developing our proved reserves and production will be highly dependent on net cash provided by operating activities and the capital resources available to us. 

 47 

Table of Contents 
 Based on strip prices as of September 30, 2024, we believe that net cash provided by operating activities and available borrowings under the Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements, including normal operating needs, debt service obligations, capital expenditures and commitments and contingencies for at least the next 12 months. Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash flows (in thousands): 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 2024 Net cash provided by operating activities 682,546 571,286 Net cash used in investing activities (914,137) (588,251) Net cash provided by financing activities 231,591 16,965 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents Operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was 682 million and 571 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased between periods primarily due to lower natural gas prices, changes in working capital and higher interest expense, partially offset by lower net marketing expense and higher NGLs and oil revenues between periods and a 202 million payment for early settlement of our swaption agreement in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our net operating cash flows are sensitive to many variables, the most significant of which is the volatility of natural gas, NGLs and oil prices, as well as volatility in the cash flows attributable to settlement of our commodity derivatives. Prices for natural gas, NGLs and oil are primarily determined by prevailing market conditions. Regional and worldwide economic activity, weather, infrastructure capacity to reach markets, storage capacity and other variables influence the market conditions for these products. These factors are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. Investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities decreased from 914 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 588 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to lower well completions between periods, decreased drilling activity as a result of a lower rig count during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and decreased leasing activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Financing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities decreased from 232 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 17 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease between periods is primarily due to lower net borrowings on our Credit Facility of 330 million and payment of debt issuance costs for our Unsecured Credit Facility of 6 million, partially offset by decreased share repurchases of 75 million and decreased distributions to the noncontrolling interests in Martica of 46 million between periods. 2024 Capital Budget and Capital Spending On February 14, 2024, we announced a net capital budget for 2024 of 725 million to 800 million. Our budget includes: a range of 650 million to 700 million for drilling and completion and 75 million to 100 million for leasehold expenditures. We do not budget for acquisitions. During 2024, we plan to complete 45 to 50 net horizontal wells in the Appalachian Basin. We periodically review our capital expenditures and adjust our budget and its allocation based on liquidity, drilling results, leasehold acquisition opportunities and commodity prices. On October 30, 2024, we announced a decrease in our net capital budget for drilling and completion to a range of 640 million to 660 million to reflect operational efficiencies and the deferral of a drilled but uncompleted pad due to low natural gas prices. Our revised net capital budget for 2024 is 715 million to 760 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our total consolidated capital expenditures were 172 million, including drilling and completion costs of 148 million, leasehold acquisitions of 23 million and other capital expenditures of 1 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our total consolidated capital expenditures were 578 million, including drilling and completion costs of 499 million, leasehold acquisitions of 69 million and other capital expenditures of 10 million.

Accounting estimates and assumptions are considered to be critical if there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the reported amounts in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2023 Form 10-K for information on our critical accounting estimates. We evaluate the carrying amount of our proved natural gas, NGLs and oil properties for impairment on a geological reservoir basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a property s carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of our proved properties exceeds the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows (measured using futures prices at the balance sheet date), we further evaluate our proved properties and record an impairment charge if the carrying amount of our proved properties exceeds the estimated fair value of the properties. Based on future prices as of September 30, 2024, the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows exceeded the carrying amount and no further evaluation was required. We have not recorded any impairment expenses associated with our proved properties during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024. We believe that the estimates and assumptions related to our undiscounted future net cash flows and the fair value of our proved properties are critical because different natural gas, NGLs and oil pricing, cost assumptions or discount rates, as applicable, may affect the recognition, timing and amount of an impairment and, if changed, could have a material effect on the Company's financial position and results of operations. New Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for information on new accounting pronouncements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements See Note 13 Commitments to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further information on off balance sheet arrangements. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risk. The term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices, as well as interest rates. These disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. This forward-looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures.

Table of Contents 
 Commodity Hedging Activities Our primary market risk exposure is in the price we receive for our natural gas, NGLs and oil production. Pricing is primarily driven by spot regional market prices applicable to our U.S. natural gas production and the prevailing worldwide price for oil. Pricing for natural gas, NGLs and oil has, historically, been volatile and unpredictable, and we expect this volatility to continue in the future. The prices we receive for our production depend on many factors outside of our control, including volatility in the differences between commodity prices at sales points and the applicable index price. We may enter into financial derivative instruments for a portion of our natural gas, NGLs and oil production when circumstances warrant and management believes that favorable future prices can be secured in order to mitigate some of the potential negative impact on our cash flows caused by changes in commodity prices. Due to our improved liquidity and leverage position as compared to historical levels, the percentage of our expected production that we hedge has decreased. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, substantially all of our production was unhedged. Our financial hedging activities may include commodity fixed price swaps, basis swaps, collars or other similar instruments related to the price risk associated with our production. These contracts are financial instruments and do not require or allow for physical delivery of the hedged commodity. As of September 30, 2024, our commodity derivatives included fixed swaps, basis differential swaps, call options and embedded put options at index-based pricing for a portion of our production. See Note 11 Derivative Instruments to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for more information. Our financial hedging activities are intended to support natural gas, NGLs and oil prices at targeted levels and to manage our exposure to natural gas, NGLs and oil price fluctuations. These contracts may include commodity price swaps whereby we will receive a fixed price and pay a variable market price to the contract counterparty, collars that set a floor and ceiling price for the hedged production, basis differential swaps or embedded options. These contracts are financial instruments and do not require or allow for physical delivery of the hedged commodity. Based on our production and our derivative instruments that settled during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our revenues would have decreased by 113 million for each 0.10 decrease per MMBtu in natural gas prices and 1.00 decrease per Bbl in oil and NGLs prices, excluding the effects of changes in the fair value of our derivative positions which remain open as of September 30, 2024. All derivative instruments, other than those that meet the normal purchase and normal sale scope exception or other derivative scope exceptions, are recorded at fair market value in accordance with GAAP and are included in our consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities. The fair values of our derivative instruments are adjusted for non-performance risk. Because we do not designate these derivatives as accounting hedges, they do not receive hedge accounting treatment; therefore, all mark to market gains or losses, as well as cash receipts or payments on settled derivative instruments, are recognized in our statements of operations and comprehensive income. We present total gains or losses on commodity derivatives (for both settled derivatives and derivative positions which remain open) within operating revenues as commodity derivative fair value gains (losses) in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Mark-to-market adjustments of derivative instruments cause earnings volatility but have no cash flow impact relative to changes in market prices until the derivative contracts are settled or monetized prior to settlement. We expect continued volatility in the fair value of our derivative instruments. Our cash flows are impacted when the associated derivative contracts are settled or monetized by making or receiving payments to or from the counterparty. As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, the estimated fair value of our commodity derivative instruments was a net liability 37 million and 27 million, respectively, comprised of current and noncurrent assets and liabilities. Counterparty and Customer Credit Risk Our principal exposures to credit risk are through receivables resulting from the following: the sale of our natural gas, NGLs and oil production 319 million as of September 30, 2024), which we market to energy companies, end users and refineries, and commodity derivative contracts 7 million as of September 30, 2024). We are subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our receivables from several significant customers for sales of natural gas, NGLs and oil. While we do at times require customers to post letters of credit or other credit support in connection with their obligations, we generally do not require our customers to post collateral. The inability or failure of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us, or their insolvency or liquidation, may adversely affect our financial results. In addition, we are exposed to the credit risk of our counterparties for our derivative instruments. Credit risk is the potential failure of a counterparty to perform under the terms of a derivative contract. When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty is expected to owe us, which creates credit risk. To minimize the credit risk in derivative

 instruments, it is our policy to enter into derivative contracts only with counterparties that are creditworthy financial institutions that management deems to be competent and competitive market makers. The creditworthiness of our counterparties is subject to periodic review. As of September 30, 2024, we have commodity hedges in place with four different counterparties, three of which are lenders under the Unsecured Credit Facility. We had derivative assets of 3 million with bank counterparties under our Unsecured Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024. The estimated fair value of our commodity derivative assets has been risk-adjusted using a discount rate based upon the counterparties respective published credit default swap rates (if available, or if not available, a discount rate based on the applicable Reuters bond rating) as of September 30, 2024. We believe that all of the counterparties to our derivative instruments are acceptable credit risks as of September 30, 2024. We are not required to provide credit support or collateral to any of our counterparties under our derivative contracts, nor are they required to provide credit support to us. As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any past-due receivables from, or payables to, any of the counterparties to our derivative contracts. Interest Rate Risks Our primary exposure to interest rate risk results from outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility, which has a floating interest rate. The average annualized interest rate incurred on the Credit Facility for borrowings during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 7.70 . We estimate that a 1.0 increase in the applicable average interest rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 would have resulted in an estimated 3 million increase in interest expense. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 at a level of reasonable assurance. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings The information required by this item is included in Note 14 Contingencies to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and is incorporated herein. Item 1A. Risk Factors We are subject to certain risks and hazards due to the nature of the business activities we conduct. For a discussion of these risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in the 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to the risks described in such report. We may experience additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us. Furthermore, as a result of developments occurring in the future, conditions that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect us.
