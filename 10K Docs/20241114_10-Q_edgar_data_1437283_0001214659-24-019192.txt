ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

Overview 

REGO Payment Architectures, Inc. is a provider
of consumer software that delivers a mobile payment platform Mazoola - a family focused mobile banking solution. Headquartered
in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, the Company maintains a portfolio of trade secrets and four US patent awards. REGO offers an all-digital financial
payments platform to enable minors, particularly under 13 years old, to transact, complete chores and learn in a secure online environment
guided by parental permission, oversight, and control, while remaining COPPA and GDPR compliant. 

COPPA applies not only to websites and mobile
apps. It can apply to a growing list of connected devices that is included in the Internet of Things. Some of these include toys and products
that could collect personal information, such as voice recordings or geolocation information. Non-compliance with COPPA has meant substantial
fines for many violators. 

Management believes that by building on its COPPA
compliance advantage, the future of REGO Payment Architectures, Inc. will be based on the foundational architecture of its software platform
(the Platform that will allow its use across multiple financial markets where secure controlled payments are needed. The
Company intends to license in each alternative field of use the ability for its partners, distributors and/or value-added resellers to
private label each of the alternative markets. These partners will deploy, customize and support each implementation under their own label,
but with acknowledgement of the Company s proprietary intellectual assets as the base technology. Management believes this approach
will enable the Company to reduce marketing expenses while broadening its reach. 

Further, California passed the California Consumer
Privacy Act of 2018 CCPA on June 28, 2018. CCPA gives consumers (defined as natural citizens who are California residents)
four rights relative to their personal information as follows: 

the right to know, through a general privacy policy and with more specifics
available upon request, what personal information a business has collected about them, where it was sourced from, what it is being used
for, whether it is being disclosed or sold, and to whom it is being disclosed or sold; 

the right to opt out of allowing a business to sell their personal
information to third parties (or, for consumers who are under 16 years old, the right not to have their personal information sold absent
their, or their parent s, opt-in); 

16 

Table of Contents 

the right to have a business delete their personal information, with some
exceptions; and 

the right to receive equal service and pricing from a business, even if they
exercise their privacy rights under the CCPA. 

With respect to the evolving CCPA, the Company
has designed its Platform and app to be in compliance. 

Additionally, the European Parliament and Council
agreed upon the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR in April 2016, to replace the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC.
This is the primary law regulating how companies protect European Union EU citizens personal data. GDPR became
effective on May 25, 2018. Companies that fail to achieve GDPR compliance are subject to severe fines and penalties. 

GDPR requirements apply to each member state of
the European Union, aiming to create more consistent protection of consumer and personal data across EU nations. Some of the key privacy
and data protection requirements of the GDPR include: 

Requiring the consent of subjects for data processing 

Anonymizing collected data to protect privacy 

Providing data breach notifications 

Safely handling the transfer of data across borders 

Requiring certain companies to appoint a data protection officer to oversee
GDPR compliance 

In short, the handling of EU citizens data
is mandated by GDPR using a baseline set of standards for companies that are designed to better safeguard the processing and movement
of personal data. The Company has designed its Platform and app to be in compliance with GDPR, and has received the GDPRkidsTM Trustmark
from PRIVO. 

Revenues generated from the Platform will come
from multiple sources depending on the level of service and facilities requested. There will be levels of subscription revenue paid monthly,
service fees, transaction fees and in some cases, revenue sharing and licensing with banking and distribution partners. 

Our goal, moving forward, is to enable both incumbent
and new financial technology FinTech participants, as well as key verticals with a large base of family accounts, 
to provide their consumers with safe and empowering youth money management and financial literacy content and tools via the mobile payment
platform. 

While some of the REGO Platform can be easily
duplicated/commoditized, such as the app skin, APIs to retailers, APIs to financial infrastructure and cloud storage, we believe that
defending our market position rests on three factors: 

1. The ability to define data control settings from parent to child. 

Our approach to this opportunity uses
a master account to dictate purchase rules to sub-accounts via a hierarchical architecture. This approach adheres to data flow and privacy
policy requirements specifically outlined for COPPA compliance. We believe other approaches based on machine learning, or other artificial
intelligence methodologies are potentially viable alternatives but are likely too costly, do not meet current compliance timelines, and
may defy the core of COPPA s opt-in parameters. There is considerable room for next-generation automation techniques
to be layered on REGO s hierarchical approach. Given its current stability and scalability metrics, the REGO Platform strongly features
these advances in its technical development roadmap without compromising any of its current data control performance. 

2. The ability to (mis)attribute the child s transaction and personal identification. 

REGO has solved this issue by masking
user data and maintaining separate identity and financial data flows. As a result, REGO can verify the age of the internet user through
the transaction lifecycle on its Platform. Authenticating and validating the identity of the actual user on the internet remains one of
the more difficult cybersecurity challenges. Current approaches are mainly not for commercial use; however, there is investment in commercial
innovation in this area. REGO s data control features and its (mis)attribution approach are inextricably linked and a key to its
scalability and extensibility. 

17 

Table of Contents 

3. The ability to disseminate transactional data on minors while remaining COPPA and GDPR compliant. 

The highest value data will be that which shows the most
nuanced detail afforded under current regulations. Without extreme data control features, such as in the REGO Platform, any lesser data
precision will be less valuable. 

These three factors are all supported by REGO s patented technology. 

REGO addresses hard industry problems such as: 

COPPA compliant technology with a key component being its ability to verify
the age of an internet user 

A master and sub-account architecture with the ability to administer user-specific
controls 

An advanced rules engine to provide strict automated compliance of the parental
rules for each child 

Near real-time buying behavior database on minors - anonymized geolocation,
age range and purchases 

Currently, we are targeting established brands
with large family-focused account bases including banks, telecommunication companies, faith-based organizations, media distributors,
mobile device Original Equipment Manufacturers OEMs ), and merchants. 

We are seeking partners that will leverage our Platform to: 

Buy vs. Build: Partners can license or
revenue share for their specific market or field of use a safe, compliant system, instead of building one on their own. 

Safety Security: Partners can safely
engage a younger consumer segment and their families with a new family friendly peer-to-peer-payment approach. Vendors will be explicitly
protected from non-compliant transactions and the underlying technology protects the privacy of the user. 

Youth Financial Literacy: Partners can expand their brand story
around empowerment and education of youth financial literacy while engaging their future customers with Gen Z, a digital
native population of post-millennial youth. 

The REGO Mazoola app and associated digital
wallet technology is designed to enable our partners to engage families with Gen Z and Gen Alpha youths through a money management, transactional
and financial literacy platform that enables young people to make smart decisions about the things they value in life including
their money, their time, their ideas and their connections. The Mazoola app enables a new way for individual users to own and monetize
their purchasing behavior that is currently unavailable to them. 

In addition, we are analyzing specific components of our technology
for individual monetization as well as exploring opportunities in the Business to Business B2B realm. 

Other markets for potential licensed applications are: 

Government social services payments where control
over how benefits allowances are used is required. This is particularly necessary in some European countries where social benefits are
not being used as intended by the government or where benefits are subject to fraud.

Closed network consumer to business (C2B) and
business to business (B2B). An example is school lunch programs where the consumer can make direct mobile payments to the provider s
point of sale (POS) terminal without the need to traverse the traditional merchant payment system. This reduces the cost per transaction
for the vendor and provides instant non-repudiated settlement. Many school lunch programs are now provided by large catering companies.
This is particularly valuable as credit card fees, transaction fees and service fees can exceed 3 in overhead costs per transaction dependent
on the negotiated rate. Removing this overhead can have significant positive financial impact on profitably. It also allows the closed
network to own its own behavioral use data thus obviating the need to pay a third party for the same data. 

Integration of our certified COPPA-compliant
white label Family Wallet Banking-as-a-Platform into digital banking platforms. This will make the Company's family wallet available to
financial institutions which will allow end-user customers of subscribing financial institutions to utilize the Company's family wallet. 

We believe that our near-term success will depend
particularly on our ability to develop customer awareness and confidence in our service. Since we have extremely limited capital resources,
we will need to closely manage our expenses and conserve our cash by continually monitoring any increase in expenses and reducing or eliminating
unnecessary expenditures. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties encountered by companies at
an early stage of development, particularly given that we operate in new and rapidly evolving markets, that we have limited financial
resources, and face an uncertain economic environment. We may not be successful in addressing such risks and difficulties. 

Results of Operations 

Comparison of the Three Months Ended September
30, 2024 and 2023 

The following discussion
analyzes our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The following information should be considered
together with our condensed financial statements for such periods and the accompanying notes thereto. 

Net Revenue 

We have not generated
significant revenue since our inception. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated revenues of 0 and

Transaction Expense 

Transaction expense for
the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 86,955 compared to 56,581 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. These are transactional
charges primarily for the operation of the Mazoola app. The increase is attributed to higher costs associated with a new Platform
provider implemented in 2024. 

Sales and Marketing 

Sales and marketing expenses
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 116,605 compared to 468,115 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease
of 351,510. The decrease is attributed to the elimination and replacement of certain marketing consultants with more cost-effective service
providers along with lower marketing options expense in 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Product Development 

Product development expenses
were 912,706 and 758,614 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, an increase of 154,092. This was primarily a
result of increased cyber-security and SOC2 costs incurred in 2024 which were not incurred during the three months ended September 30,
2023. Also, payroll costs increased as a result of a Product Development new hire in September 2024.

General and Administrative
Expenses 

General and administrative
expenses decreased 95,288 to 810,411 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 905,699 for the three months ended September
30, 2023. The decrease resulted from lower payroll costs and professional fees which were partially offset by increases to Board and consulting
fees for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Interest Expense 

During the three months
ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company incurred interest expense of 247,310 and 254,313. No new Notes were issued
over the prior twelve-month period. However, interest expense is slightly lower for the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared
to the three months ended September 30, 2023 since a 10 Secured Convertible Noteholder converted 280,120 of principal plus 205,773
of accrued interest into 5,399 shares of Series B Preferred Stock on January 1, 2024. 

Dividend Accrual 

Accrued preferred dividend
expense increased by 50,943 to 704,599 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 653,656 for the three months ended
September 30, 2023. The expense increased as a result of the additional Series B Preferred Stock sold since September 30, 2023. 

Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September
30, 2024 and 2023 

The following discussion
analyzes our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The following information should be considered
together with our condensed financial statements for such periods and the accompanying notes thereto. 

Net Revenue 

We have not generated
significant revenue since our inception. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated revenues of 0 and 0.

the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 287,288 compared to 171,543 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of
 115,745. These are transactional charges primarily for the operation of the Mazoola app. The increase is attributed to higher
costs associated with a new Platform provider implemented in 2024. 

Sales and Marketing 

Sales and marketing expenses
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 526,065 compared to 1,475,458 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease
of 949,393. The decrease is attributed to the elimination and replacement of certain marketing consultants with more cost-effective service
providers along with a decrease in marketing options expense in 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Product Development 

Product development expenses
were 2,592,996 and 2,051,020 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, an increase of 541,976. The increase is due additional
programming costs, cyber-security costs, compliance costs, new product development costs, white label integration costs, and additional
payroll expense all associated with the ramp up of integrations with channel providers and new product development. These were new costs
incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and not incurred for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

General and Administrative
Expenses 

General and administrative
expenses decreased 6,572,863 to 2,961,321 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 9,534,184 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. The Company expensed approximately 3,750,000 for stock grants to officers and directors during the nine months ended September
30, 2023 which did not occur during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, a 300,000 increase to consultant fees was
offset by a 1,900,000 decrease in consulting options expense, a 600,000 decrease in professional fees, a 500,000 decrease in payroll
costs, and a 100,000 decrease in board fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the nine months ended September

ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred interest expense of 741,461 compared to 762,235 for the nine months ended September 30,
2023, a decrease of 20,774. No new Notes were issued over the prior twelve-month period. However, interest expense is slightly lower
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 since a 10 Secured Convertible
Noteholder converted 280,120 of principal plus 205,773 of accrued interest into 5,399 shares of Series B Preferred Stock on January

expense increased by 435,449 to 2,001,033 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1,565,584 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. The expense increased as a result of the additional Series B Preferred Stock sold since September 30, 2023. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of November 14, 2024 we had cash on hand of
approximately 3.9 million. 

Net cash used in operating
activities increased 53,377 to 5,503,379 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 5,450,002 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. The increase resulted primarily from the change in the fair value of options and the fair value of common stock
issued in exchange for services offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and a decrease in accounts payable-accrued expenses as compared
to that of the same period in the prior year. 

Net cash used in investing
activities decreased to 1,118 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 11,215 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023
as a result of a decrease in patents and trademarks expense. 

Net cash provided by
financing activities decreased to 3,723,021 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 7,129,049 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. Proceeds from the sale of Series B Preferred Stock and the exercise of options decreased when compared to the prior year. 

As we have not realized
significant revenues since our inception, we have financed our operations through offerings of debt and equity securities. On March 13,
2023, the Company entered into a 20 million Investor Private Line of Credit agreement with an existing shareholder of the Company. On
March 13, 2024, the Company entered into an Amendment to the LOC (the Amendment with the Lender. The Amendment extended
the maturity date of the existing LOC with the Lender by one year, from March 13, 2024 to March 13, 2025. As of September 30, 2024 the
outstanding balance on this LOC is 0.

Table of Contents 

Since our inception,
we have focused on developing and implementing our business plan. We believe that our existing cash resources will not be sufficient
to sustain our operations during the next twelve months. We currently need to generate sufficient revenues to support our
cost structure to enable us to pay ongoing costs and expenses as they are incurred, finance enhancements to our Platform, and execute
the business plan. If we cannot generate sufficient revenue to fund our business plan, we intend to seek to
raise such financing through the sale of debt and/or equity securities. The issuance of additional equity would result in dilution
to existing shareholders. The issuance of convertible debt may also result in dilution to existing stockholders. If we are unable
to obtain additional funds when they are needed or if such funds cannot be obtained on terms acceptable to us, we will be unable
to execute upon the business plan or pay costs and expenses as they are incurred, which would have a material, adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q. 

Even if we are successful
in generating sufficient revenue or in raising sufficient capital in order to commercialize the Platform, our ability to continue in business
as a viable going concern can only be achieved when our revenues reach a level that sustains our business operations. We do
not project that significant revenue will be developed at the earliest until the first quarter of 2025. There can be no assurance that
we will raise sufficient proceeds, or any proceeds, for us to implement fully our proposed business plan. Moreover, there can
be no assurance that even if the Platform is fully developed and successfully commercialized, that we will generate revenues sufficient
to fund our operations. In either such situation, we may not be able to continue our operations and our business might fail. 

Based upon the current
cash position and the Company s planned expense run rate, management believes the Company will not be able to finance its operations
on a limited basis beyond April 2025. 

The foregoing forward-looking
information was prepared by us in good faith based upon assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. No assurance can be given, however,
regarding the attainability of the projections or the reliability of the assumptions on which they are based. The projections are subject
to the uncertainties inherent in any attempt to predict the results of our operations, especially where new products and services are
involved. Certain of the assumptions used will inevitably not materialize and unanticipated events will occur. Actual results of operations
are, therefore, likely to vary from the projections and such variations may be material and adverse to us. Accordingly, no assurance can
be given that such results will be achieved. Moreover, due to changes in technology, new product announcements, competitive pressures,
system design and/or other specifications we may be required to change the current plans. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of September 30, 2024,
we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Critical Accounting
Policies 

Our financial statements
are impacted by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation. A complete
summary of these policies is included in Note 1 of the Notes to Financial Statements included in the Company s Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2023. We have identified below the accounting policies that are of particular importance in the presentation
of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows and which require the application of significant judgment by management. 

Stock-based Compensation 

We have adopted the fair
value recognition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification FASB ASC 718. In
addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 Share-Based Payment SAB
107 ), which provides supplemental FASB ASC 718 application guidance based on the views of the SEC. Under FASB ASC 718, compensation
cost recognized includes compensation cost for all share-based payments granted, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance
with the provisions of FASB ASC 718. 

We have used the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model to estimate the option fair values. The option-pricing model requires a number of assumptions, of which the
most significant are, expected stock price volatility, the expected pre-vesting forfeiture rate and the expected option term (the amount
of time from the grant date until the options are exercised or expire). 

22 

Table of Contents 

All issuances of stock
options or other equity instruments to non-employees as consideration for goods or services received by the Company are accounted for
based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued. Non-employee equity-based payments that do not vest immediately upon
grant are recorded as an expense over the vesting period. 

Revenue Recognition 

In accordance with FASB
ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , the Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies performance obligations,
by transferring promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to
be entitled in exchange for fulfilling those performance obligations. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

Recently issued accounting
pronouncements are discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this report. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

Not required. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

As of September 30, 2024
we carried out the evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange
Act under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September
30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that
we file or submit under the Exchange Act is: (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SEC s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

There has been no change
in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
