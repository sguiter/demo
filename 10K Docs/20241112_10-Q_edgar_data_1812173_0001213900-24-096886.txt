through commercialization, and we will need to raise additional capital to complete the development and commercialization of our product.
We may satisfy our future cash needs through the sale of equity securities, debt financings, corporate collaborations or other agreements,
working capital lines of credit, grant funding, interest income earned on invested cash balances or a combination of one or more of these

June 10, 2024, the Company s stockholders approved an amendment to the 2021 Plan, which provides for the granting of up to 
additional shares of Class A common stock under the 2021 Plan as determined by the Board of Directors. 

The 2021 Plan provides for the granting of incentive and
nonqualified stock options, restricted stock, and other stock-based awards to employees, officers, directors, consultants, and advisors
of the Company. Under the 2021 Plan, incentive and nonqualified stock options may be granted at not less than of the fair market
value of the Company s common stock on the date of grant. If an incentive stock option is granted to an individual who owns more
than of the combined voting power of all classes of the Company s capital stock, the exercise price may not be less than 
of the fair market value of the Company s common stock on the date of grant and the term of the option may not be longer than five
years. PSOs include threshold, target, and maximum achievement levels based on the achievement of specific performance measures. PSOs
are subject to forfeiture if applicable performance measures are not attained. The expense is recognized over the vesting period, based
on the best available estimate of the number of share units expected to vest. Estimates are subsequently revised if there is any indication
that the number of share units expected to vest differs from previous estimates. Any cumulative adjustment prior to vesting is recognized
in the current period. In June 2024, PSOs were granted and represent the maximum achievement levels based on the achievement of
specific performance measures. 

17 

shares of common stock (either Class A or Class B) pursuant to awards granted under the 2021 Plan. The Board of Directors administers
the 2021 Plan and determines the specific terms of the awards. The contractual term of options granted under the 2021 Plan is not more
than years. The 2021 Plan will expire on April 13, 2031 or an earlier date approved by a vote of the Company s stockholders or
Board of Directors. 

The Company issues RSUs of Class A common stock to certain
employees and members of the Board of Directors. The RSUs vest over a four-year period. PSUs are issued in the form of performance share
units. PSUs include threshold, target, and maximum achievement levels based on the achievement of specific performance measures. PSUs
are subject to forfeiture if applicable performance measures are not attained. The expense is recognized over the vesting period, based
on the best available estimate of the number of share units expected to vest. Estimates are subsequently revised if there is any indication
that the number of share units expected to vest differs from previous estimates. Any cumulative adjustment prior to vesting is recognized
in the current period. In July 2023, PSUs were granted and an additional PSUs could have been earned if certain performance
measures are overachieved.

The Company grants stock options to employees at exercise
prices deemed by the Board of Directors to be equal to the fair value of the Class A common stock at the time of grant. For options with
a service condition, the fair value of the Company s stock options and warrants on the date of grant is determined by a Black-Scholes
pricing model utilizing key assumptions such as common stock price, risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, expected volatility and expected
life. The Company s estimates of these assumptions are primarily based on the fair value of the Company s stock, historical
data, peer company data and judgement regarding future trends. The Company uses its publicly traded stock price as the fair value of its
common stock.

The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed
interest rates appropriate for the term of the related stock options. The expected life of employee and non-employee stock options was
calculated using the average of the contractual term of the option and the weighted-average vesting period of the option, as the Company
does not have sufficient history to use an alternative method to calculate an expected life for employees. The Company does not pay a
dividend and is not expected to pay a dividend in the foreseeable future. Expected volatility for the Company s common stock was
determined based on a combination of an average of the historical volatility of a peer group of similar public companies and the Company s
own stock. 

As of September 
30, 2024, there was of total gross unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested stock options. The costs remaining

pursuant to Instruction 2 to paragraph (b) of Item 303 of Regulation S-K. 

Overview 

We are combining advanced miniaturized robotics, computer science,
sensing and 3D visualization to build a new category of intelligent and affordable, single-port surgical robot that virtually transports
surgeons inside the patient to perform minimally invasive surgery. With our next-generation robotics technology which is being designed
with proprietary human-like motion, we are seeking to improve patient outcomes, as well as the cost and efficacy of surgical procedures.
Led by a visionary team of engineers from MIT, we intend to deliver the next generation in robotic surgery, designed to solve the shortcomings
of both open surgery, as well as current manual and robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery. 

We estimate there are over 45 million soft tissue surgical procedures
(including an estimated 3.9 million ventral hernia procedures), addressable annually worldwide by our technology. Of these procedures,
it is estimated that more than 50 are performed using open surgery, and less than 5 are performed by current robot-assisted minimally
invasive surgery. 

We believe this slow adoption of robot-assisted surgery has occurred
because of several factors, including the following: 

Significant
Capital Investment . Legacy robotic systems require high upfront acquisition costs and burdensome annual service contracts that
are often prohibitively expensive, especially in outpatient settings. Based on discussion with industry sources, we estimate these capital
costs to be up to 2.0 million or more per system upfront, plus an additional 10 to 20 annually for maintenance and service contracts. 

Low
Utilization . In addition to the significant acquisition costs, existing robotic systems create inefficiencies and increase costs
to medical facilities considering adoption. Due to their large size and limited portability, existing robotic systems require the construction
of a dedicated operating room, occupying valuable real estate within the hospital. Once in place, these robotic systems require extensive
set-up and operating room turnover times, which limits the number of procedures that can be performed with the robotic system. 

Limited
Capabilities . Existing robotic systems have limited capabilities and are ill-suited for many outpatient procedures. Due to their
limited degrees of freedom inside the abdomen, they depend on significant, complicated, robotic motion outside the body, and they have
limited ability to operate in multiple quadrants, difficulty operating on the ceiling of the abdomen, create collisions
inside and outside of the patient s abdomen, and restrict overall access of the operating team to the patient. 

Difficult
to Use . Existing robotic systems require the surgeon to develop an extensive procedure plan in advance to determine appropriate
incision sites and angles for each procedure, in order to avoid collisions inside and outside of the patient s abdomen. Surgeons
must develop this plan with fewer degrees of freedom than they would employ using open surgery, restricting their natural movements.
Becoming proficient at manipulating these legacy robotic systems to perform the procedures they otherwise were trained to perform via
open surgery requires extensive training and several dozen procedures on live patients. As these systems are maintained in dedicated,
expensive, operating rooms, obtaining access to train on the system becomes a significant impediment to adoption, resulting in more open
surgeries. 

21 

The single-port Vicarious Surgical System with advanced, miniaturized
robotics and exceptional visualization is designed to address the significant limitations of open surgery and existing single- and multi-port
robotic surgical approaches to improve patient outcomes and enhance adoption by hospitals and other medical facilities. The Vicarious
Surgical System is designed with a fundamentally different architecture, and proprietary de-coupled actuators, to overcome
many of the limitations of open surgery or existing robot-assisted surgical procedures with a minimally invasive and more capable robotic
system. This architecture enables unprecedented dexterity inside the abdomen through an ultra-thin support tube, providing significant
improvement over existing legacy robotic systems and minimizing the complications and trauma associated with open surgery. The Vicarious
Surgical System has not yet been authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (the FDA ). We have had pre-submission meetings
with the FDA to align on our regulatory strategy and plan to file a de novo application with the FDA for use in ventral hernia procedures
as our first indication. 

The dollar amounts set forth in this section are presented in thousands,
except for per share amounts. 

Recent Developments 

Regained Compliance with NYSE Continued
Listing Requirements 

As previously reported, on September 20, 2023, we received notice from
the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE notifying us that, because average closing share price for the Company s Class
A common stock was less than 1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period, the Company no longer met the NYSE s continued listing
criterion relating to minimum share price. 

On July 26, 2024, we were notified by the NYSE that our Class A common
stock had an average closing share price of at least 1.00 over the 30 trading-day period ending on July 26, 2024, and therefore we had
regained compliance with the applicable NYSE continued listing standard. 

Financial Highlights 

We are pre-revenue generating as of September 30, 2024. 

We incurred net losses of 49,927 and 57,960 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. These losses include a loss of 415 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024
and a gain of 3,705 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to the change in valuation of our warrant obligations. Our loss
from operations prior to the warrant loss and gain and other income and expense items was 51,577 and 65,125 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing a period-over-period gain of 21 , which was primarily due to decreases of 10,071
in personnel-related expenses, 1,684 in supplies and materials, and 1,317 in insurance expenses. The decrease in personnel-related expense
was due primarily to a decrease in average headcount of 35 , from an average of 199 people in the nine months ended September 30, 2023
to an average of 130 people for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Factors Affecting Results of Operations 

The following factors have been important to our business and we expect
them to impact our results of operations and financial condition in future periods: 

Revenue 

To date, we have not generated any revenue. We do not expect to generate
revenue unless and until we receive FDA authorization of our product candidate. The amount of revenue, if any, from initial sales of a
new product is difficult to predict and, even if we successfully commercialize our product candidate upon approval and begin generating
revenue, such revenues will initially only modestly reduce our continued net losses resulting from our research and development and marketing
activities which we expect to continue to increase even after market authorization is received. 

22 

Research and Development Expenses 

R D expenses consist primarily of engineering, product development,
regulatory expenses, medical affairs, and other costs associated with product candidates and technologies that are in development. These
expenses include employee compensation, including stock-based compensation, supplies, consulting, prototyping, testing, materials, travel
expenses, depreciation and an allocation of facility overhead expenses. Additionally, R D expenses include internal and external costs
associated with our regulatory compliance and quality assurance functions and overhead costs. We expect R D expenses as a percentage
of revenue to vary over time depending on the level and timing of our new product development efforts, as well as our clinical development,
clinical trial and other related activities. 

General and Administrative Expenses 

General and administrative G A expenses consist
primarily of compensation for personnel, including stock-based compensation, related to executive, finance and accounting, information
technology and human resource functions. Other G A expenses include travel expenses, professional services fees (including legal,
audit and tax fees), insurance costs, general corporate expenses and allocated facilities-related expenses. We expect G A expenses
to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our infrastructure to both drive and support the anticipated growth due to additional
legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses associated with being a public company. 

Sales and Marketing Expenses 

Sales and marketing S M expenses consist primarily
of compensation for personnel, including stock-based compensation, related to selling and marketing functions and physician education
programs. Other S M expenses include training, travel expenses, promotional activities, marketing initiatives, market research and
analysis, conferences and trade shows, professional services fees and allocated facilities-related expenses. We expect S M expenses
to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we increase potential customers awareness of our presence and prepare our sales
and marketing function for our product launch at a future, yet undetermined date. 

Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities 

The change in fair value of warrant liability represents the mark-to-market
fair value adjustments to the outstanding Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants assumed as part of the consummation of the Business
Combination on September 17, 2021. The change in fair value of our Private Placement Warrants is primarily the result of the change in
the underlying stock price of our stock used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model while the Public Warrants are marked-to-market
based on their price on the NYSE. The warrant liability was measured at fair value initially on September 17, 2021 and is remeasured at
exercise, and for warrants that remain outstanding at the end of each subsequent reporting period. 

Interest Income 

Interest income consists primarily of interest income earned on our
cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. 

Interest Expense 

Interest expense consists primarily of interest incurred on our equipment
loans that were paid off in April 2023.

 2,240, or 17 , to 10,800 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 13,040 during the three months ended September
30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to decreases of 2,067 of personnel-related expenses, 242 in software expenses, 185 in materials
and supplies and partially offset by an increase of 298 in professional services. The decrease in personnel-related expense was due primarily
to a decrease in average headcount of 29 , from an average of 146 people in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to an average of
103 people in the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Sales and Marketing Expenses . S M expenses decreased 193,
or 14 , to 1,208 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1,401 during the three months ended September 30, 2023.
This decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 170 in personnel-related expenses. The decrease in personnel-related expense was due
primarily to a decrease in average headcount of 31 , from an average of 13 people in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to an average
of 9 people in the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

24 

General and Administrative Expenses . G A expenses decreased
 1,164, or 17 , to 5,747 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6,911 during the three months ended September
30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to decreases of 441 in personnel-related expenses, 370 in insurance expense, 221 in professional
services and 77 in software expense. The decrease in personnel-related expense was due primarily to a decrease in average headcount of
30 , from an average of 23 people in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to an average of 16 people in the three months ended September
30, 2024. 

Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities . The change in fair
value of warrant liabilities during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was a 138 loss. The change in fair value of the warrant
liability resulted from the remeasurement of the Public Warrant and Private Placement Warrant liabilities between June 30, 2024 and the
end of the reporting period, September 30, 2024. 

Interest and Other Income . Interest and other income decreased
by 144 to 802 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 946 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The
decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest income from short-term investments. 

Interest Expense . Interest expense decreased by 1 to 0 during
the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily
due to the equipment loans being paid off in April 2023. 

Income Taxes . Our income tax provision consists of an estimate
for U.S. federal and state income taxes based on enacted rates, as adjusted for allowable credits, deductions, uncertain tax positions,
changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax law. Due to historical cumulative losses and expected future losses,
we maintain a full valuation allowance against our U.S. and state deferred tax assets.

Comparison of the Nine Months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023

Research and Development Expenses . R D expenses decreased
 7,418, or 19 , to 31,692 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 39,110 during the nine months ended September
30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to decreases of 7,746 in personnel-related expenses, 1,649 in materials and supplies, 274
in software expense and partially offset by an increase of 2,255 in professional fees. The decrease in personnel-related expense was
due primarily to a decrease in average headcount of 32 , from an average of 155 people in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to
an average of 106 people in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Sales and Marketing Expenses . S M expenses decreased 1,481,
or 29 , to 3,546 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5,027 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
This decrease was primarily due to decreases of 803 in personnel-related expenses and 558 in professional services. The decrease in
personnel-related expense was due primarily to an average headcount decrease of 47 , from an average of 17 people in the nine months ended
September 30, 2023 to an average of 9 people for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

General and Administrative Expenses . G A expenses decreased
 4,649, or 22 , to 16,339 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 20,988 during the nine months ended September
30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to decreases of 1,522 in personnel-related expenses, 1,359 in insurance expense, 1,122 of
professional fees, 194 in software expense and 370 in other operating costs. The decrease in personnel-related expense was due primarily
to a decrease in average headcount of 43 , from an average of 28 people in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to an average of 16
people in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities . The change in fair
value of warrant liabilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a 415 loss. The change in fair value of the warrant
liability resulted from the remeasurement of the Public Warrant and Private Placement Warrant liabilities between December 31, 2023 and
the end of the reporting period, September 30, 2024. 

Interest and Other Income . Interest and other income decreased
by 768 to 2,695 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3,463 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest income from short-term investments. 

Interest Expense . Interest expense decreased by 3 to 0 during
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due
to the equipment loans being paid off in April 2023. 

Income Taxes . Our income tax provision consists of an estimate
for U.S. federal and state income taxes based on enacted rates, as adjusted for allowable credits, deductions, uncertain tax positions,
changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax law. Due to historical cumulative losses and expected future losses,
we maintain a full valuation allowance against our U.S. and state deferred tax assets. 

26 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

To date, our primary sources of capital have been private placements
of preferred stock prior to the Business Combination, the recapitalization with D8 and the issuance of common stock. Net cash used in
our operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023 was 38,168 and 62,305, respectively.
As of September 30, 2024, we held cash and cash equivalents of 7,069, short-term investments of 53,795 and had an accumulated deficit
of 182,009. 

Excluding the non-cash impact of potential changes in the fair value
of warrant liabilities, we expect net losses to continue in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue to invest
in commercialization and new product development. We believe our current cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balance of
 60,864 as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to support our operations beyond the next twelve months from the date of issuance
of these financial statements. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, any changes
in the size, number and scope of clinical trials we may be required to conduct, the timing and conditions of market authorization (if
any) for the Vicarious Surgical System, whether we are able to successfully commercialize the Vicarious Surgical System, if approved,
additional product candidates we may choose to develop, fluctuations in the cost and timing of our business activities, including manufacturing,
hiring and protection of our intellectual property portfolio, and the other risks and uncertainties described in the Risk Factors 
sections in Part I, Item 1A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 4, 2024,
in Part II, Item 1A in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, filed with the SEC on August 13, 2024, and
in other filings that we make with the SEC from time to time. 

We expect that we will need to obtain substantial additional funding
in order to complete our clinical trials, obtain market authorization for the Vicarious Surgical System, and commercialize it, if approved.
Until such time, if ever, as we can generate sufficient revenues to support our expenses, we may seek to sell additional common or preferred
equity or convertible debt securities, enter into an additional credit facility or another form of third-party funding or seek other debt
financing. The sale of equity and convertible debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders. Preferred equity securities
or convertible debt could provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock, including liquidation or
other preferences that could adversely affect the rights of our existing stockholders. The terms of debt securities issued or borrowings
pursuant to a credit agreement could impose significant restrictions on our operations. If we raise funds through collaborations and licensing
arrangements, we might be required to relinquish significant rights to our platform technologies or product candidates or grant licenses
on terms that are not favorable to us, or that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves. Additional capital may not
be available on reasonable terms, or at all, particularly given the current macroeconomic environment, including diminished liquidity
and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence and economic growth, rising interest rates, inflation, uncertainty about economic
stability and potential for economic recession. If the equity and credit markets deteriorate, it may make any necessary debt or equity
financing more difficult to obtain, more costly and more dilutive. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms,
we could be forced to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development, market authorization or commercialization of the
Vicarious Surgical System or future product candidates, or seek collaborators at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or
on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available. 

On October 7, 2022, we filed a universal shelf registration statement
on Form S-3 (the Form S-3 ), which was declared effective by the SEC on October 27, 2022, on which we registered for sale
up to 400 million of any combination of our Class A common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, rights and/or units from
time to time and at prices and on terms that we may determine, which includes up to 100 million of Class A common stock that we may issue
and sell from time to time, through Cowen and Company, LLC acting as our sales agent, pursuant to the sales agreement that we entered
into with Cowen and Company, LLC on October 7, 2022 for our at-the-market equity program. In December 2022, we issued 3,048,781
shares of Class A common stock under our sales agreement with Cowen and Company, LLC, resulting in gross proceeds of 10.0 million. We
did not issue any Class A common stock under our sales agreement with Cowen and Company, LLC during the nine months ended September 30,
2024. 

On August 2, 2023, we entered into an underwriting agreement related
to the public offering of 45,000,000 shares of our Class A common stock, at a public offering price of 1.00 per share less the underwriting
discounts and commission, pursuant to the Form S-3. We received approximately 45 million in gross proceeds from this offering, before
deducting underwriting discounts and commission and offering expenses. The offering closed on August 7, 2023. In addition, 2,045,224 shares
of Class A common stock were issued upon exercise of by the underwriters at their option to purchase additional shares at the same offering
price, which closed on August 29, 2023. The gross proceeds from the offering of 47,045,224 shares of our Class A common stock were 47.0
million and net proceeds of 44.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable
by us

Cash 

Our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments balance as
of September 30, 2024 was 7,069 and 53,795, respectively. Our future capital requirements may vary from those currently planned and
will depend on various factors, including the timing and extent of R D spending and spending on other strategic business initiatives.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared
in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the consolidated
balance sheet date, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our management bases its estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about
the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences could be material
to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

While our significant accounting policies are described in the notes
to our historical condensed consolidated financial statements (see Note 2 of the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements), we believe the following critical accounting policy requires significant judgment and estimates in the preparation of our
condensed consolidated financial statements: 

Warrant Liabilities 

We recognize our warrants as liabilities at fair value and adjust the
warrant liability to fair value at each reporting period. The liabilities are subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until
exercised, and any change in fair value is recognized in the statement of operations. The fair value of Public Warrants is determined
from their trading value on public markets. The fair value of Private Placement Warrants is calculated using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model. The assumptions used in the model are the Company s stock price, exercise price, expected term, volatility, interest
rate, and dividend yield. 

The Company estimates the volatility of its warrants based on implied
volatility from the Company s Public Warrants and from historical volatility of select peer companies common stock that matches
the expected remaining life of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve on the
grant date for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the warrants. The expected life of the warrants is assumed to be equivalent
to their remaining contractual term. The dividend rate is based on the historical rate, which the Company anticipates remaining at zero. 

29 

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 

A description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may
potentially impact our financial position and results of operations is disclosed in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Emerging Growth Company 

Following the Business Combination, we became an emerging growth
company, as defined in the JOBS Act. Pursuant to the JOBS Act, an emerging growth company is provided the option to adopt new or
revised accounting standards that may be issued by FASB or the SEC either (i) within the same periods as those otherwise applicable to
non-emerging growth companies or (ii) within the same time periods as private companies. We currently take advantage of the exemption
for complying with new or revised accounting standards within the same time periods as private companies. Accordingly, the information
contained herein may be different than the information you receive from other public companies. 

We take advantage of some of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements
of emerging growth companies pursuant to the JOBS Act, and we intend to continue to do so as long as we qualify as an emerging growth
company, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation, and exemptions from the requirements of holding non-binding
advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute payments. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the
Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Background and Remediation of Material Weaknesses 

In connection with our evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures
covering our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over
financial reporting. We have concluded that material weaknesses exist in our disclosure controls and procedures, including internal control
over financial reporting, as we do not have the necessary business processes, personnel and related internal controls to operate in a
manner to satisfy the accounting and financial reporting requirements of a public company. These material weaknesses manifested themselves
in ways that included the improper segregation of duties relating to review of the recording of journal entries and the reconciliation
of key accounts and safeguarding of assets, as well as the analysis of accounting for certain transactions and accounts, improper controls
related to information technology, ineffective risk assessment process and documentation and monitoring of control processes, accounting
policies and procedures. 

30 

We are focused on designing and implementing effective internal controls
measures to improve our evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures, including internal control over financial reporting, and remediate
the material weaknesses. In order to remediate these material weaknesses, we have taken and plan to take the following actions: 

the
hiring and continued hiring of additional accounting, finance and legal resources with public company experience; and 

implementation
of additional review controls and processes requiring timely account reconciliation and analyses of certain transactions and accounts. 

These actions and planned actions are subject to ongoing evaluation
by management and will require testing and validation of design and operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
over future periods. We are committed to the continuous improvement of our internal control over financial reporting and will continue
to review the internal control over financial reporting. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, as such term is defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15 (e) and 15d-15 (e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective
as of September 30, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file and submit under
the Securities and Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required. 

Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
identified in connection with the evaluation of such internal control required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act
that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting. 

31
