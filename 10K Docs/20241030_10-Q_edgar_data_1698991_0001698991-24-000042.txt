different licensed establishments (the Defendant Establishments in 2012 in violation of the contractual rights held by J J Ventures Gaming, LLC J J ), as further described below. 
 On August 21, 2012, one of the Company s operating subsidiaries entered into certain agreements with Jason Rowell Rowell ), a member of Action Gaming LLC Action Gaming ), which was an unlicensed terminal operator that had exclusive rights to place and operate gaming terminals within a number of establishments, including the Defendant Establishments. Under agreements with Rowell, the Company agreed to pay him for each licensed establishment which decided to enter into an exclusive location agreement with Accel. In late August and early September 2012, each of the Defendant Establishments signed a separate location agreement with the Company, purporting to grant the Company the exclusive right to operate gaming terminals in those establishments. Separately, on August 24, 2012, Action Gaming sold and assigned its rights to all its location agreements to J J, including its exclusive rights with the Defendant Establishments (the J J Assigned Agreements ). At the time of the assignment of such rights to J J, the Defendant Establishments were not yet licensed by the IGB. 
 Action Gaming, J J, and other parties, collectively, the Plaintiffs, filed a complaint against the Company, Rowell, and other parties in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois (the Circuit Court ), on August 31, 2012, as amended on November 1, 2012, December 19, 2012, and October 3, 2013, alleging, among other things, that Accel aided and abetted Rowell in breaches of his fiduciary duties and contractual obligations with Action Gaming and tortiously interfered with Action Gaming s contracts with Rowell and agreements assigned to J J. The complaint seeks damages and injunctive and equitable relief. On January 24, 2018, the Company filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, as further described below. On May 14, 2018, the Circuit Court denied the Company s motion to dismiss and granted a stay to the case, pending a ruling from the IGB on the validity of the J J Assigned Agreements. 
 From 2013 to 2015, the Plaintiffs filed additional claims, including J J Ventures Gaming, LLC et al. v. Wild, Inc. Wild ), in various circuit courts seeking declaratory judgments with a number of establishments, including each of the Defendant Establishments, requesting declarations that, among other things, J J held the exclusive right to operate gaming terminals at each of the Defendant Establishments as a result of the J J Assigned Agreements. The Company was granted leave to intervene in all of the declaratory judgments. The circuit courts found that the J J Assigned Agreements were valid because each of the underlying location agreements were between an unlicensed establishment and an unlicensed terminal operator, and therefore did not constitute use agreements that were otherwise precluded from assignment under the IGB s regulations. Upon the Company s appeal, the Illinois Appellate Court, Fifth District (the District Court ), vacated the circuit courts judgments and dismissed the appeals, holding that the IGB had exclusive jurisdiction over the matter that formed the basis of the parties claims, and declined to consider the merits of the parties disputes. On September 22, 2016, and after the IGB intervened, the Supreme Court of Illinois issued a judgment in Wild, affirming the District Court s decision vacating the circuit courts judgments for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and dismissing the appeals, determining that the IGB has exclusive jurisdiction to decide the validity and enforceability of gaming terminal use agreements. 
 Between May 2017 and September 2017, both the Company and J J filed petitions with the IGB seeking adjudication of the rights of the parties and the validity of the use agreements. Those petitions were recently adjudicated by the IGB, largely in the Company s favor, and J J has filed a new lawsuit to challenge the IGB s rulings. The Company does not have a present estimate regarding the potential damages, if any, that could potentially be awarded in this litigation and, accordingly, has established no reserves relating to such matters. There are also petitions pending with the IGB which could lead to the Company obtaining new locations. 
 On October 7, 2019, the Company filed a lawsuit in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois against Rowell and other parties related to Rowell s breaches of his non-compete agreement with Accel. The Company alleged that Rowell and a competitor were working together to interfere with the Company s customer relationships. On November 7, 2019, Rowell filed a lawsuit in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois against the Company alleging that he had not received certain equity interests

million in exchange for a mutual release of the Company's claims against Rowell and Rowell's claims against the Company. The litigation involving Action Gaming, J J, and the other parties, as described above, remains pending. 
 On July 2, 2019, Illinois Gaming Investors, LLC filed a lawsuit against the Company. The lawsuit alleges that a current employee violated his non-competition agreement with Illinois Gaming Investors, LLC, and together with the Company, wrongfully solicited prohibited licensed video gaming locations. The parties settled this dispute in April 2022. 
 On December 18, 2020, the Company received a disciplinary complaint from the IGB alleging violations of the Video Gaming Act and the IGB s Adopted Rules for Video Gaming. The disciplinary complaint sought to fine the Company in the amount of million. On July 6, 2023, the IGB and the Company entered into a settlement agreement for million of which million is the fine for the alleged conduct and million is for reimbursement of administrative and investigative costs. The amount was paid in the third quarter of 2023. As a result of the settlement agreement, the Company has agreed to review similar initiatives with the IGB before implementing a new program or making any public announcements, require additional annual training of its employees, and provide additional compliance disclosures to the IGB. 
 On March 9, 2022, the Company filed a lawsuit in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois against Gold Rush relating to the Gold Rush convertible notes. The complaint sought damages for breach of contract and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing as well as unjust enrichment. On June 22, 2022, Gold Rush filed a lawsuit in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois against the Company. The lawsuit alleged that the Company tortiously interfered with Gold Rush s business activities and engaged in misconduct with respect to the Gold Rush convertible notes. On April 22, 2022, the Company filed a petition in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois to judicially review the IGB's decision to deny the requested transfer of Gold Rush common stock in respect of the Company s conversion of the convertible notes. Discovery ensued on these lawsuits but both suits were dismissed with prejudice as a result of the previously mentioned settlement between the Company and Gold Rush on the convertible notes. The Company also withdrew its petition to judicially review the IGB's decision. For more information, see Note 4. 
 On March 25, 2022, Midwest Electronics Gaming LLC Midwest filed an administrative review action against the Illinois Gaming Board, the Company and J J in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois seeking administrative review of decisions of the IGB ruling in favor of the Company and J J and against Midwest regarding the validity of certain use agreements covering locations currently serviced by Midwest. No monetary damages are sought against the Company. The Company filed a motion to dismiss Midwest s amended complaint, which was granted in part and denied in part. 
 In July 2022, an enforcement action was brought against the Company by an Illinois municipality related to an alleged violation of an ordinance requiring the collection of an additional tax, the enforceability of which is currently being contested by the Illinois Gaming Machine Operators Association. Rather than litigate the alleged violation, the Company pled no contest and paid an initial penalty to the municipality in October 2022 and for the remaining months of 2022. The Company continued to negotiate with and voluntarily make the appropriate payments to the municipality during 2023 and 2024. 
 In February 2023, an Illinois municipality issued an order against the Company for the alleged failure to pay a terminal operator tax TO Tax for the privilege of operating gaming terminals within the municipality. The TO Tax was adopted by the municipality on June 8, 2021, but there was no enforcement of this tax until the Company was issued a notice of hearing in February 2023. In April 2023, the Company, along with numerous other terminal operators, filed a complaint in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois contesting the validity and enforceability of the TO Tax and won a temporary restraining order to stay the order. Currently, the matter remains pending as a result of a motion to consolidate and to finalize the assignment of the judge.

 Company Overview 
 We are a leading distributed gaming operator in the United States U.S. and a preferred partner for local business owners in the markets we serve. We offer turnkey, full-service gaming solutions to bars, restaurants, convenience stores, truck stops, and fraternal and veteran establishments across the country. Our focus is providing unmatched customer support, guidance, and expertise so our location partners can grow their businesses with incremental revenue. 
 We install, maintain, operate and service gaming terminals and related equipment for our location partners as well as redemption devices that have automated teller machine ATM functionality and stand-alone ATMs. We offer amusement devices, including jukeboxes, dartboards, pool tables, and other entertainment related equipment. These operations provide a complementary source of lead generation for our gaming business by offering a one-stop source of additional equipment for our location partners. We also design and manufacture gaming terminals and related equipment. We are continuously evaluating additional opportunities that are complementary to our core business, such as our pending acquisition of the FanDuel Sportsbook Horse Racing in Collinsville, Illinois, as discussed in Note 10 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.

Macroeconomic Factors 
 Ongoing interest rate uncertainty, persistent inflation and actual or perceived instability in the U.S. and global banking systems may increase the risk of an economic recession and volatility in the capital or credit markets in the U.S. and other markets globally. Our location partners may be adversely impacted by changes in overall economic and financial conditions, and certain location partners may cease operations in the event of a recession or inability to access financing. Furthermore, our revenue is largely driven by players disposable incomes and level of gaming activity, and economic conditions that adversely impact players ability and desire to spend disposable income at our locations partners may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. 
 To date, we have not observed material impacts in our business or outlook, outside of observed increases in our costs related to higher wages and increased interest expense on our debt. In 2023 and the first half of 2024, we accelerated certain of our capital expenditures related to gaming machines and related components to manage our supply chain. 
 We intend to continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions closely and may determine to take certain financial or operational actions in response to such conditions to the extent our business begins to be adversely impacted.

 Interest expense, net 
 Interest expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 9.2 million, an increase of 0.7 million, or 8.9 , compared to the prior-year period primarily due to an increase in average outstanding debt, partially offset by the benefit realized on our interest rate caplets.

 The change in the fair value of contingent earnout shares for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was a loss of 4.2 million, compared to a loss of 1.6 million the prior- year period.

 Net revenues 
 Total net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 913.5 million, an increase of 40.1 million, or 4.6 , compared to the prior-year period. This increase was primarily driven by higher net gaming revenue of 40.2 million, which reflected an increase in gaming locations and terminals. Net revenues by state are presented below (in thousands):

 Cost of revenue 
 Cost of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 633.3 million, an increase of 28.7 million, or 4.8 , compared to the prior-year period, driven by higher net gaming revenue, as described above. 
 Cost of manufacturing goods sold 
 Cost of manufacturing goods sold for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 5.3 million, a decrease of 0.3 million, or 6.1 , compared to the prior-year period primarily due to lower manufacturing revenue. 
 General and administrative 
 General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 142.1 million, an increase of 9.7 million, or 7.3 , compared to the prior-year period. The increase was attributable to higher payroll-related costs, as we continue to grow our operations, as well as higher stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by lower legal settlements and lower parts and repair expense. 
 Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment 
 Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 32.2 million, an increase of 4.3 million, or 15.5 , compared to the prior-year period due to an increased number of gaming terminals. 
 Amortization of intangible assets and route and customer acquisition costs 
 Amortization of intangible assets and route and customer acquisition costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 16.8 million, an increase of 1.0 million, or 6.2 , compared to the prior-year period. 
 Other expenses, net 
 Other expenses, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 13.6 million, an increase of 8.6 million, or 172.1 , compared to the prior-year period. The increase was primarily attributable to higher fair value adjustments associated with the revaluation of contingent consideration liabilities and higher non-recurring expenses related to acquisitions, as well as the impact of a 1.7 million gain recognized in the prior-year period on the convertible note settlement as discussed in Note 4 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.

 Interest expense, net 
 Interest expense, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 26.7 million, an increase of 2.2 million, or 8.9 , compared to the prior-year period primarily due to an increase in average outstanding debt and higher interest rates, partially offset by the benefit realized on our interest rate caplets. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the weighted average interest rate, excluding the impact of our interest rate caplets, was approximately 7.6 compared to a rate of approximately 7.2 for the prior-year period . 
 Loss on change in fair value of contingent earnout shares 
 The change in the fair value of contingent earnout shares for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a loss of 4.2 million, compared to a loss of 11.1 million the prior- year period. The change was primarily due to the change in the market value of our Class A-1 common stock, which is the primary input to the valuation of the contingent earnout shares. 
 Income tax expense 
 Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 12.3 million, a decrease of 4.5 million, or 26.7 , compared to the prior-year period. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 31.3 compared to 36.1 in the prior-year period. Our effective income tax rate can vary from period to period depending on, among other factors, the amount of permanent tax adjustments and discrete items. The change in the fair value of the contingent earnout shares is considered a discrete item for tax purposes and can be the primary driver for the fluctuations in the tax rate year over year. 
 
 Key Business Metrics 
 We use statistical data and comparative information commonly used in the gaming industry to monitor the performance of the business, none of which are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and therefore should not be viewed as indicators of operational performance. Our management uses these key business metrics for financial planning, strategic planning and employee compensation decisions. The key business metrics include: 
 Number of locations and; 
 Number of gaming terminals 
 Location hold-per-day 
 We also periodically review and revise our key business metrics to reflect changes in our business. 
 Number of locations 
 The number of locations is based on a combination of third-party portal data and data from our internal systems. We utilize this metric to continually monitor growth from existing locations, organic openings, purchased locations, and competitor conversions. Competitor conversions occur when a location chooses to change terminal operators.

 Number of gaming terminals 
 The number of gaming terminals in operation is based on a combination of third-party portal data and data from our internal systems. We utilize this metric to continually monitor growth from existing locations, organic openings, purchased locations, and competitor conversions. 
 The following table sets forth information with respect to the number of gaming terminals in our primary locations:

 Location hold-per-day 
 Location hold-per-day is calculated by dividing net gaming revenue in the period by the average number of locations. Then divide the calculated amount by the number of operational days. We utilize this metric to compare market and location performance on a normalized basis. The percent change in location hold-per-day is the underlying metric we use to determine the change in same-store sales.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income are non-GAAP financial measures, but are key metrics management uses to monitor ongoing core operations. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income exclude the effects of certain non-cash items or represent certain nonrecurring items that are unrelated to core performance. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures enhance the understanding of our underlying drivers of profitability, trends in our business, and facilitate company-to-company and period-to-period comparisons. Management also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are used by investors, analysts and other interested parties as measures of financial performance and to evaluate our ability to fund capital expenditures, service debt obligations and meet working capital requirements. 
 Adjusted net income is defined as net income plus: 
 Amortization of intangible assets and route and customer acquisition costs 
 Stock-based compensation expense 
 Loss from unconsolidated affiliates 
 Loss on change in fair value of contingent earnout shares 
 Other expenses, net which consists of (i) non-cash expenses including the remeasurement of contingent consideration liabilities, (ii) non-recurring lobbying and legal expenses related to distributed gaming expansion in current or prospective markets, and (iii) other non-recurring expenses 
 Tax effect of adjustments 
 Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income plus:

 Emerging markets which reflects the results, on an Adjusted EBITDA basis, for non-core jurisdictions where our operations are developing 
 Markets are no longer considered emerging when we have installed or acquired at least 500 gaming terminals in the jurisdiction, or when 24 months have elapsed from the date we first install or acquire gaming terminals in the jurisdiction, whichever occurs first 
 We currently view Pennsylvania as an emerging market 
 Prior to January 2024, Iowa was considered an emerging market 
 Prior to April 2023, Nebraska was considered an emerging market

 Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 45.9 million , an increase of 1.7 million, or 3.9 , compared to the prior-year period. Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , was 141.8 million , an increase of 4.9 million, or 3.6 , compared to the prior-year period. The increase for both periods was attributable to an increase in the number of locations and gaming terminals. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and borrowing availability under the Credit Agreement (as defined below) will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the next twelve months. Our primary short-term cash needs are paying operating expenses and contingent earnout payments, purchases of property and equipment, servicing outstanding indebtedness, and funding our Board of Directors approved share repurchase program and near-term acquisitions. As of September 30, 2024 , we had 265.1 million in cash and cash equivalents. 
 Senior Secured Credit Facility 
 We have entered into a credit agreement (as amended the Credit Agreement as borrower, with our wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries, as guarantors, the banks, financial institutions and other lending institutions from time to time party thereto, as lenders, the other parties from time to time party thereto and Capital One, National Association, as administrative agent (in such capacity, the Agent ), collateral agent, issuing bank and swingline lender, providing for a: 
 150.0 million revolving credit facility, including a letter of credit facility with a 10.0 million sublimit and a swingline facility with a 10.0 million sublimit, 
 a 350.0 million initial term loan facility, and 
 a 400.0 million delayed draw term loan facility DDTL 
 The maturity date of the Credit Agreement is October 22, 2026. 
 As of September 30, 2024, there remained 273 million of availability under the Credit Agreement and the weighted-average interest rate on our borrowings under the Credit Agreement was approximately 7.6 . 
 35 

Table of Contents 

 During October 2024, we borrowed an additional 119.0 million on the DDTL under the Credit Agreement, of which 77.5 million was used to pay down the revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement, 35.0 million is anticipated to be used for a pending business acquisition and the remaining 6.5 million was used for general business operations. Our ability to borrow on the DDTL ended on October 22, 2024. 
 We were in compliance with all debt covenants under the Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2024 and expect to remain in compliance for the next 12 months. 
 Interest rate caplets 
 We manage our exposure to some of our interest rate risk through the use of interest rate caplets, which are derivative financial instruments. On January 12, 2022, we hedged the variability of the cash flows attributable to the changes in the 1-month LIBOR/SOFR interest rate on the first 300 million of the term loan under the Credit Agreement by entering into a 4-year series of 48 deferred premium caplets caplets . 
 We recognized an unrealized loss, net of taxes, o n the change in fair value of the caplets of 4.1 million for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. In comparison, we recognized an unrealized gain of 0.1 million and an unrealized loss of less than 0.1 million , net of taxes, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. We also recognized interest income on the caplets of 2.6 million and 7.7 million for the three and nine m onths ended September 30, 2024, respectively. In comparison, we recognized interest income on the caplets of 2.5 million and 6.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. These amounts are reflected in interest expense, net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income. 
 
 Cash Flows

 Net cash provided by operating activities 107,665 92,007 15,658 17.0 Net cash used in investing activities (90,224) (35,404) (54,820) (154.8) Net cash used in financing activities 
 (13,967) (50,328) 36,361 72.2 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 107.7 million, an increase in cash of 15.7 million compared to the prior-year period due primarily to higher working capital adjustments and higher remeasurements on contingent consideration, partially offset by lower deferred income taxes. 
 Net cash used in investing activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 90.2 million, a decrease in cash of 54.8 million compared to the prior-year period. The decrease in cash was primarily attributable to the proceeds from the settlement of the convertible notes in the prior year as well as more cash used for business and asset acquisitions, higher deposits paid against a portion of the purchase price on a pending business acquisition and an investment in an equity interest, partially offset by lower purchases of property and equipment. We anticipate our capital expenditures will be approximately 60 65 million in 2024.

Table of Contents 

 Net cash used in financing activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was 14.0 million, an increase in cash of 36.4 million compared to the prior-year period. The change reflects higher net borrowings on our debt, partially offset by higher stock repurchases. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 In preparing our condensed consolidated financial statements, we applied the same critical accounting policies as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, that affect judgments and estimates of amounts recorded for certain assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. 
 
 Seasonality 
 Our results of operations can fluctuate due to seasonal trends and other factors. For example, the gross revenue per machine per day is typically lower in the summer when players will typically spend less time indoors at our locations, and higher in cold weather between February and April, when players will typically spend more time indoors at our locations. Holidays, vacation seasons, and sporting events may also cause our results to fluctuate. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates. 
 Interest rate risk 
 We are exposed to interest rate risk in the ordinary course of business. Borrowings under our senior secured credit facility were 556.3 million as of September 30, 2024. If the underlying interest rates were to increase by 1.0 , or 100 basis points, the increase in interest expense on our floating rate debt would negatively impact future earnings and cash flows by approximately 2.6 million annually, assuming the balance outstanding under the credit facility remained at 556.3 million. In order to protect against higher interest rates in the future on our credit facility, we hedged the variability of the cash flows attributable to the changes in the 1-month LIBOR/SOFR interest rate on the first 300 million of the term loan by entering into a 4-year series of 48 deferred premium caplets caplets on January 12, 2022. The caplets mature at the end of each month and are used to protect our exposure as the 1-month LIBOR/SOFR interest rate exceeded 2 . 
 C ash and cash equivalents are held in cash vaults, highly liquid checking and money market accounts, gaming terminals, redemption terminals, ATMs, and amusement equipment. As a result, these amounts are not materially affected by changes in interest rates.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 Information required by this Item is incorporated by reference to the discussion in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, of the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 An investment in our Class A-1 common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risk factors described under Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q in analyzing an investment in our Class A-1 common stock. If any such risks occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would likely suffer, the trading price of our Class A-1 common stock would decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. In addition, the risk factors and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in our forward-looking statements, whether made in this report or other documents we file with the SEC, or our annual report to stockholders, future press releases, or orally, whether in presentations, responses to questions, or otherwise. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those we currently view to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 
 There have been no material changes in the risk factors described in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 On November 22, 2021, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program of up to 200 million shares of our Class A-1 common stock. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities. Under the repurchase program, repurchases can be made from time to time using a variety of methods, including open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, in compliance with the rules of the SEC and other applicable legal requirements. The repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of shares, and the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion. 
 All share repurchases were made under our publicly announced program, and there are no other programs under which we repurchase shares. Repurchases under our program, during applicable restricted trading windows that we periodically establish, are executed under the terms of a pre-set trading plan meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ).
