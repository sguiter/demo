Basis of Presentation and Organization 

This summary of significant accounting policies of the Company is presented to assist in understanding the Company s financial statements. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements. While the Company has commenced generating revenues from its principal business purpose during the most recently completed quarter ended September 30, 2024, we remain in the development stage in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic No. 915 (SFAS No. 7). The Company has elected a fiscal year end of December 31. 

The accompanying financial statements are prepared on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the continuation of the Company as a going concern. 

The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain additional financing and to generate revenue and cash flow to meet its obligations on a timely basis. The Company expects to finance its operations primarily through cash flow from revenue and continuing financial support from a shareholder. In the event that we require additional funding to finance the growth of the Company s current and expected future operations as well as to achieve our strategic objectives, the shareholder has indicated the intent and ability to provide additional financing. The Company will focus on the following activities: (1) improve operational efficiency, and enhance marketing function (2) seek to raise additional funding through debt or equity financing. 

Based on cash flows projection from operating and financing activities and existing balance of cash and cash equivalents, management concludes that the Company has sufficient funds for sustainable operations and it will be able to meet its payment obligations from operations and debt related commitments for the next twelve months from the issuance of the consolidated financial statements. 

Based on the above considerations, the accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.

Results of operations 

Three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Revenue 

Operating revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which resulted primarily from the business advisory services revenue, was 74,278 as compared with the operating revenue of 42,346 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily a result of the removal of restrictions imposed by Chinese government agencies on business operations in order to control the spread of COVID-19 in 2023. 

Operating costs and expenses 

General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which resulted primarily from costs associated with the business advisory services revenue, was 35,467, as compared to 55,570 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in operating expenses is due to less costs associated with Form S1. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We had 8,205 in cash on hand as of September 30, 2024. 

Net cash used in operating activities was 4,162 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to -11,556 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The material decrease in cash used in operating activities during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to less costs associated with Form S1.

The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate positive cash flow from an operating company, and/or raise capital through equity and debt financing or other means on desirable terms. If the Company is unable to obtain additional funds when they are required or if the funds cannot be obtained on favorable terms, management may be required to restructure the Company or cease operations. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

As a smaller reporting company as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide information required by this Item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, and in light of the material weaknesses found in our internal controls over financial reporting, our chief executive officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. The matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (i) lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of a majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (ii) inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk assessment; and (iii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our chief executive officer in connection with the review of our financial statements as of September 30, 2024. 

Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The internal controls for the Company are provided by executive management s review and approval of all transactions. Our internal control over financial reporting also includes those policies and procedures that: 

1. 
 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; 

2. 
 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorization of our management; and 

3. 
 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

13 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Management s assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of these controls.
