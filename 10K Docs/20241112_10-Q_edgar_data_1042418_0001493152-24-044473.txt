The
results of operations for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of results
that may be expected for any other interim period or for the full fiscal year. Readers of this Quarterly Report are strongly encouraged
to review the risk factors relating to the Company which are set forth in the 2023 Annual Report and the Company s other filings
with the SEC. 

Nature
of the Business 

The
Company s primary focus is on the development of therapies initially for basal cell carcinoma nevus syndrome BCCNS ),
prostate and lung cancers in the United States utilizing itraconazole, a drug currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA to treat fungal infections, and which has an extensive history of safe and effective use in humans. The Company has
developed intellectual property and know-how related to the treatment of cancer patients using itraconazole. 

On
December 12, 2023, the Company entered into an Exclusive License Agreement (the Agreement with Johns Hopkins University JHU ). Pursuant to the Agreement, JHU granted to the Company the exclusive worldwide patent rights to a Granted US Patent,
No. 8,980,930 entitled New Angiogenesis Inhibitors (the Patent ). The Patent relates to the treatment of prostate
cancer, basal cell carcinoma BCC including BCCNS, and lung cancer.

 (Unaudited) 

In
May 2024, the Company formally requested a Type-B, pre-investigational new drug application pre-IND meeting with the
FDA to obtain feedback on the overall drug development and regulatory plan to use itraconazole for the treatment of BCC tumors in BCCNS
patients, for which the Company has engaged the services of external experts in the field to assist with the process. The Company s
Phase 2b clinical study (HP2001) uses a novel formulation of itraconazole, which is referenced in the pre-IND submission. 

The
Company was granted a meeting in late June 2024 with the Dermatology Division of the FDA, which the Company subsequently cancelled (with
acknowledgement from the FDA), as the Company believed it required input from the FDA s Division of Oncology. Additionally, the
FDA required further understanding of the right of use to the HP2001 study to further discuss some of the Pre-IND questions. The FDA
has agreed to consult the Division of Oncology as necessary and the Company believes it has provided sufficient information around the
right of use to proceed with the Pre-IND.

to continue to execute the Company s business plan as currently anticipated, assuming the receipt of favorable guidance from the
FDA such that additional clinical trials will not be required, however there can be no assurances of this outcome in the near term. Based
on the current operational plan and budget, the Company expects to have sufficient cash over the next 12 months to manage its business
and continue to pursue other drug development opportunities, as needed. As capital requirements for additional opportunities are determined,
or additional clinical trials, the Company will consider raising additional capital in the public market, if necessary and on commercially
reasonable terms.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

The
following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Financial Statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere
in this Quarterly Report. This discussion contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company s
actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements as a
result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth herein and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and in the Company s
other filings with the SEC. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements below. 

As
used in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, unless otherwise indicated,
the terms the Company , we , us , our and similar terminology refer to Inhibitor
Therapeutics, Inc. 

Background
of Our Company 

We
are a pharmaceutical development company that is focused on developing and ultimately commercializing innovative therapeutics based on
already approved active pharmaceuticals that have patent-protected methods of use and/or methods of delivery for patients with certain
cancers and certain non-cancerous proliferation disorders. We also have explored and expect to continue to explore acquiring or licensing
other innovative pre-clinical and clinical stage therapeutics addressing unmet needs for the treatment of cancer and other diseases based
on repurposing active ingredients of already approved drugs. 

Our
current primary focus is on the development of therapies initially for BCCNS, prostate and lung cancers in the United States utilizing
itraconazole, a drug currently approved by the FDA to treat fungal infections, and which has an extensive history of safe and effective
use in humans. We have developed intellectual property and know-how related to the treatment of cancer patients using itraconazole. 

On
December 12, 2023, we entered into an Exclusive License Agreement (the Agreement with Johns Hopkins University JHU ).
Pursuant to the Agreement, JHU granted our Company the exclusive worldwide patent rights to a Granted US Patent, No. 8,980,930 entitled
 New Angiogenesis Inhibitors (the Patent ). The Patent relates to the treatment of prostate cancer, BCC including
BCCNS, and lung cancer. 

In
May 2024, we formally requested a Type-B, pre-investigational new drug application pre-IND meeting with the FDA to obtain
feedback on the overall drug development and regulatory plan to use itraconazole for the treatment of BCC tumors in BCCNS patients, for
which we have engaged the services of external experts in the field to assist with the process. Our Phase 2b clinical study (HP2001)
uses a novel formulation of itraconazole, which we reference in our pre-IND submission. 

The
Company was granted a meeting in late June 2024 with the Dermatology Division of the FDA, which the we subsequently cancelled (with acknowledgement
from the FDA), as we believed it required input from the FDA s Division of Oncology. Additionally, the FDA required further understanding
of the right of use to the HP2001 study to further discuss some of the Pre-IND questions. The FDA has agreed to consult the Division
of Oncology as necessary and we believe we have provided sufficient information around the right of use to proceed with our Pre-IND. 

Further,
we have engaged Avior Bio, Inc. Avior ), which is currently creating a novel formulation of itraconazole from which results
are expected in the next several months. Avior is a privately held drug development company whose President and Chairman of the Board,
Niraj Vasisht, is a member of the Company s Board of Directors. Upon finalization of the formulation, Avior will conduct a pharmacokinetic
(PK) crossover study to the generic formulation and the formulation that was used within the HP2001 study in preparation for a new IND
and NDA. Given all formulations consist of the same active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), it is expected that the Company s
new, novel formulation will have extremely similar properties to the formulation used in the HP2001 clinical study.

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Our
critical accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements
and the accompanying notes. These estimates are based on historical experience, the advice of external experts or on other assumptions
management believes to be reasonable. Where actual amounts differ from estimates, revisions are included in the results for the period
in which actual amounts become known. Historically, differences between estimates and actual amounts have not had a significant impact
on our financial statements. Critical accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the financial statements are discussed with the
Audit Committee of our Board of Directors as they are implemented and on an annual basis. 

We
have no material changes to our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates disclosure as filed in our 2023 Annual Report. 

Results
of Operations 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 

Research
and Development Expenses. We incurred 0.3 million of research and development expenses during each of the three months ended September
30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. The expenses are primarily internal personnel costs, consisting of salaries, benefits and other related
costs, as well as amounts paid to third parties to support our research and development activities and remained consistent quarter-over-quarter.
We expect research and development expenses to increase in the future, depending on the results from our upcoming FDA meeting. 

General
and Administrative Expenses. We incurred approximately 0.5 million in general and administrative expenses during each of the three
months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative
expenses were composed primarily of compensation costs of 0.2 million, professional services fees of 0.2 million and insurance costs
of 0.1 million and remained consistent quarter-over-quarter. 

Interest
income . We earned approximately 0.1 million of interest income during each of the three months
ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 . The interest income is generated from deposits held in our depository accounts. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 

Research
and Development Expenses. We incurred 0.8 million and 0.7 million of research and development expenses during the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The expenses are primarily internal personnel costs, consisting of salaries,
benefits and other related costs, as well as amounts paid to third parties to support our research and development activities and remained
consistent with the prior year-to-date period. The increase in research and development expenses is the result of the necessary costs
to support the incremental R D activity during the current year. We expect research and development expenses will continue to increase
in the future, depending on the results from our upcoming FDA meeting. 

General
and Administrative Expenses. We incurred approximately 1.4 million in general and administrative expenses during each of the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses
are composed primarily of compensation costs of 0.7 million, professional services fees of 0.4 million and insurance costs of 0.3
million and remained consistent quarter-over-quarter. 

Interest
income . We earned approximately 0.3 million of interest income during each of the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 . The interest income is generated from deposits held in our depository accounts. 

10 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

We
are presently focused on our business plan of developing and ultimately commercializing innovative therapeutics based on already approved
active pharmaceuticals that have patent-protected methods of use and/or methods of delivery. We continue to progress with the FDA during
2024 to reach a conclusion on whether any additional clinical trials are required before submitting our New Drug Application (NDA). We
believe that our current cash on hand, approximately 6.4 million as of September 30, 2024, is sufficient to continue to execute our
business plan as currently anticipated, assuming we get favorable guidance from the FDA such that we do not require additional clinical
trials, however there can be no assurances of this outcome in the near term. Based on our current operational plan and budget, we expect
that we will have sufficient cash to manage our business and continue to pursue other drug development opportunities, as needed. As capital
requirements for additional opportunities are determined, or additional clinical trials, we will consider raising additional capital
in the public market, if necessary and on commercially reasonable terms.

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As
of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, the Company s management, with the participation of the Company s
Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer (the Certifying Officers ), conducted evaluations of our disclosure
controls and procedures. As defined under Sections 13a 15I and 15d 15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the Exchange Act ), the term disclosure controls and procedures means controls and other procedures of an
issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC.
Disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s
management, including the Certifying Officers, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

Based
on this evaluation, the Certifying Officers have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our third fiscal quarter of 2024 that materially affected, or
are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations
on the Effectiveness of Internal Controls 

Readers
are cautioned that our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial
reporting will necessarily prevent all fraud and material error. An internal control system, no matter how well conceived and operated,
can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations
in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any,
within our control have been detected. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the
likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any control design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all
potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

11 

CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
