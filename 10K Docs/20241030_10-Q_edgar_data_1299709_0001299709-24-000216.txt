 1 The weighted average for Available-for-sale securities: Non-agency MBS is based on the relative fair value of the securities and for Servicing Rights is based on the relative unpaid principal of the loans being serviced. 
 For non-agency mortgage-backed securities, significant increases (decreases) in any of those inputs in isolation would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. Generally, a change in the assumption used for the probability of default is accompanied by a directionally similar change in the assumption used for the projected loss severity and a directionally opposite change in the assumption used for projected prepayment rates. For servicing rights, significant increases in projected prepayment rates or discount rates in isolation would result in a significantly lower fair value measurement, while a significant increase in expected life in isolation would result in a significantly higher fair value measurement. Generally, a change in the projected prepayment rates is accompanied by a directionally opposite change in expected life.

 2 Private sponsors of securities collateralized primarily by first-lien mortgage loans on commercial properties or by pools of 1-4 family residential first mortgages. Primarily super senior securities secured by prime, Alt-A or pay-option ARM mortgages. 
 The Company evaluates available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position based on an analysis of a number of factors, including, but not limited to: (1) the credit characteristics of the securities, such as the forecasted cash flows, credit ratings, credit enhancement, and government agency or government sponsored enterprise backing, as applicable, and (2) whether the Company intends to sell or will be required to sell any of the securities before recovering the amortized cost basis. Based on its analysis, the Company determined the unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities are primarily driven by the increase in interest rates since the securities were purchased and, accordingly, credit losses were recognized on available-for-sale securities in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. There was amount in the allowance for credit losses for available-for-sale securities at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses for loans increased as a result of the provision for credit losses, partially offset by net charge-offs. The provision for credit losses was primarily due to the quantitative impact of macroeconomic variables in the allowance for credit losses model, primarily the U.S. unemployment rate, and increases in specific reserves, mainly in the commercial industrial - non-RE portfolio. 
 L oan products within each portfolio contain varying collateral types which impact the estimate of the loss given default utilized in the calculation of the allowance. For further discussion of the model method of estimating expected lifetime credit losses, see Note 1 Organizations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the 2024 Form 10-K. 
 Provision for credit losses - unfunded lending commitments

 The increase in the allowance for off-balance sheet lending commitments for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily driven by unfunded lending commitment growth, primarily in the commercial industrial - non-RE portfolio.

 Commitments to sell loans Commitments to contribute capital Standby letters of credit 
 In addition, the Company has million of commitments to contribute capital to LIHTC investments included in Accounts Payable and Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 12 Other Assets for additional information on LIHTC investments. 
 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer so long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The amount of collateral obtained, if it is deemed necessary by the Company, is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer. For single family loans classified as held for sale, the Company matches unfunded commitments to originate loans with commitments to sell loans. The Company also has standby letters of credit commitments. 
 In the normal course of business, Axos Clearing LLC s Axos Clearing customer activities involve the execution, settlement, and financing of various customer securities transactions. These activities may expose Axos Clearing to off-balance-sheet risk in the event the customer or other broker is unable to fulfill its contracted obligations and Axos Clearing has to purchase or sell the financial instrument underlying the contract at a loss. Axos Clearing s clearing agreements with broker-dealers for which it provides clearing services requires them to indemnify Axos Clearing if customers fail to satisfy their contractual obligation. 
 Litigation. A consolidated derivative action, In re BofI Holding, Inc., Case No. 15cv2722 GPC (KSC), is pending before the United States District Court for the Southern District of California (the Derivative Action ). The complaint in the Derivative Action sets forth allegations made in a related employment action, Erhart v. BofI Holding Inc., No. 15cv2287 BAS (NLS) (S.D. Cal.) (the Employment Action brought by a former employee of the Company and was stayed pending resolution of the Employment Action. On October 4, 2023, the court hearing the Employment Action entered a final amended judgment awarding damages and attorneys fees to the plaintiff. The defendant filed a Notice of Appeal from the Employment Action judgment and all orders merged therein, and the parties have filed opening and responsive briefs. On January 2, 2024, the Derivative Action plaintiff filed a Third Amended Complaint. On March 5, 2024, the court stayed the case until resolution of the appeal in the Employment Action. The Derivative Action defendants dispute, and intend to vigorously defend against, the allegations raised in the Third Amended Complaint. The Derivative Action plaintiff seeks damages on behalf of the Company with respect to the Employment Action and also seeks damages on behalf of the Company in connection with a now settled securities class action that was also based upon allegations made in the Employment Action and settled within available insurance coverage without attribution of wrongdoing to the Company, its management, or its directors. 
 In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the final outcome of the Employment Action it is not possible to reasonably predict or estimate the eventual loss or range of loss, if any, related thereto. 
 On October 26, 2022, a jury verdict was reached in the case of MUFG Union Bank, N.A. v. Axos Bank, et al, awarding damages to MUFG Union Bank, N.A. Judgment on such verdict was initially entered on June 5, 2023, and a corrected judgment was entered on June 20, 2023. The Company filed a Notice of Appeal to the Supreme Court of the State of New York Appellate Division (the Appellate Division on July 6, 2023, and the plaintiff filed a Notice of Cross-Appeal on July 20, 2023. The Appellate Division held oral arguments on the appeal and cross-appeal on March 5, 2024.

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various factors and circumstances. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances. However, actual results may differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions and could have a material effect on the carrying value of assets and liabilities, our results of operations and/or our cash flows. 
 Critical accounting estimates are those we consider most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require our most difficult judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates that are inherently uncertain. Our critical accounting estimates are described in detail in the 2024 Form 10-K in Note 1 Organizations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates.

 USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 In addition to the results presented in accordance with GAAP, this report includes the non-GAAP financial measures adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per common share Adjusted EPS ), and tangible book value per common share. Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not audited. Readers should be aware of these limitations and should be cautious as to their reliance on such measures. As noted below with respect to each measure, we believe the non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this report enhance investors understanding of our business and performance, and our management uses these non-GAAP measures when it internally evaluates the performance of our business and makes operating decisions. However, these non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for GAAP basis financial measures. 
 We define adjusted earnings , a non-GAAP financial measure, as net income without the after-tax impact of non-recurring acquisition-related items, (including amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions) and other costs (unusual or non-recurring charges). Adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP financial measure, is calculated by dividing non-GAAP adjusted earnings by the average number of diluted common shares outstanding during the period. We believe the non-GAAP measures of adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS provide useful information about the Company s operating performance. We believe excluding the non-recurring acquisition-related costs, and other costs provides investors with an alternative understanding of our core business. 
 Below is a reconciliation of net income, the nearest comparable GAAP measure, to adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS (Non-GAAP):

 We define tangible book value , a non-GAAP financial measure, as book value adjusted for goodwill and other intangible assets. Tangible book value is calculated using common stockholders equity minus servicing rights, goodwill and other intangible assets. Tangible book value per common share, a non-GAAP financial measure, is calculated by dividing tangible book value by the common shares outstanding at the end of the period. We believe tangible book value per common share is useful in evaluating the Company s capital strength, financial condition, and ability to manage potential losses.

 Net Interest Income 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income totaled 292.0 million, an increase of 80.9 million, or 38.3 , compared to net interest income of 211.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net interest margin increased by 81 basis points compared to the net interest margin of 4.36 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, total interest and dividend income increased 33.1 from the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a 111.3 million increase in interest income from loans, attributable to a 2.8 billion increase in average balances and a 116 basis point increase in rates earned, as well as higher discount accretion. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, total interest expense increased 25.8 from the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a 43.5 million increase in interest expense from demand and savings deposits, attributable to a 3.1 billion increase in average balances and a 29 basis point increase in rates paid. 
 Provision for Credit Losses 
 The provision for credit losses was 14.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 7.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The provision for credit losses consists of provisions for both funded loans and for unfunded lending commitments. The provision for credit losses for funded loans was 11.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and was primarily due to the quantitative impact of macroeconomic variables in the allowance for credit losses model, primarily the U.S. unemployment rate, and increases in specific reserves, mainly in the commercial industrial - non-RE portfolio. The provision for credit losses for unfunded lending commitments of 2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily driven by unfunded lending commitment growth, primarily in the commercial industrial - non-RE portfolio. Provisions for credit losses are charged to income to bring the allowance for

 credit losses for loans and unfunded lending commitments to a level deemed appropriate by management based on the factors discussed under the heading Financial Condition Asset Quality and Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans. 
 Non-Interest Income 
 The following table sets forth information regarding our non-interest income: 
 For the Three Months Ended

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, non-interest income decreased by 5.9 million, or 17.1 , primarily due to decreases of: 
 3.4 million in mortgage banking and servicing rights income, primarily attributable to the absence of a 1.9 million fair value gain in the prior year quarter and a decrease in the fair value of servicing rights in the current quarter on lower interest rates; 
 1.4 million in broker-dealer fee income, primarily attributable to lower balances on cash sorting balances at non-affiliated banks; and 
 1.0 million in prepayment penalty fee income.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, non-interest expense increased 27.0 million, or 22.4 , primarily due to increases of: 
 18.5 million in salaries and related costs primarily due to increased headcount and salaries, as the Bank continues to expand its commercial lending and deposit businesses and compliance and risk personnel; and 
 3.9 million in advertising and promotional expenses primarily due to deposit marketing.

 Provision for Income Taxes 
 Income tax expense was 46.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 35.5 million for three months ended September 30, 2023. Our effective income tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 29.43 and 30.05 , respectively. 
 
 SEGMENT RESULTS 
 Our Company determines reportable segments based on the services offered, the significance of the services offered, the significance of those services to our Company s financial condition and operating results and management s regular review of the operating results of those services. Our Company operates through two operating segments: the Banking Business Segment and the Securities Business Segment. In order to reconcile the two segments to the consolidated totals, our Company includes corporate activities and intercompany eliminations. Inter-segment transactions are eliminated in consolidation and primarily include non-interest income earned by the Securities Business Segment and non-interest expense incurred by the Banking Business Segment for cash sorting fees related to deposits sourced from Securities Business Segment customers, as well as interest expense paid by the Banking Business Segment to each of the wholly-owned subsidiaries of our Company and to our Company itself for their operating cash held on deposit with the Banking Business Segment. 
 The following tables present the operating results of the segments:

 Banking Business Segment 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our Banking Business Segment had income before income taxes of 164.8 million, compared to income before taxes of 114.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Banking Business Segment s net interest income increased 79.3 million or 37.9 compared to net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to higher interest income from loans, primarily attributable to higher average balances and rates earned, as well as higher discount accretion, partially offset by higher balances and rates paid on interest-bearing deposit balances. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Banking Business Segment s non-interest income decreased 4.0 million, or 31.6 , compared to non-interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in non-interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to lower mortgage banking and servicing rights income and lower prepayment penalty fee income. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Banking Business Segment s non-interest expense increased 17.5 million, or 17.4 , compared to non-interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in non-interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to higher salaries and related costs, data and operational processing expenses and higher advertising and promotional expenses.

 Securities Business Segment 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our Securities Business Segment had income before income taxes of 9.1 million, compared to income before income taxes of 12.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income increased 1.7 million or 31.1 , compared to net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by lower balances of borrowings in the current quarter. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, non-interest income decreased 4.7 million, or 13.5 , compared to non-interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by lower broker-dealer fee income. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, non-interest expense increased 0.6 million or 2.1 , compared to non-interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by higher salaries and related costs.

For further detail on PCD loans, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the 2024 Form 10-K. 
 
 The increase in Multifamily and Commercial Mortgage loans and the related impact on the allowance for credit losses and unaccreted discounts and loan fees, was primarily driven by the FDIC Loan Purchase. For further information on the FDIC Loan Purchase, see Note 2 Acquisitions in the 2024 Form 10-K. 
 Management establishes an allowance for credit losses based upon its evaluation of the expected lifetime credit losses related to the amortized cost basis of loans on the balance sheet. The net charge-off rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.17 , compared to 0.04 for the September 30, 2023. The increase in the net charge-off rate from the three months ended September 30, 2023, to the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily driven by charge-offs on one commercial mortgage loan and two commercial industrial non-RE loans. The amount charged off for each loan had been specifically reserved in full in the allowance for credit losses in prior periods. The commercial mortgage loan was issued in fiscal year 2020 and has been classified as substandard since September 2021. The two commercial industrial non-RE loans were issued in fiscal year 2021 and 2022, had been classified as substandard since April 2023 and February 2024, respectively. For additional information regarding the Company s allowance for credit losses, see Note 4 Loans Allowance for Credit Losses in the accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements. For a discussion of the provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, see Item 2 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations. We believe that the lower average LTV in the loan portfolio will continue to result in future lower average mortgage loan charge-offs when compared to many other comparable banks.

 Asset Quality 
 Non-performing Assets. Loans reaching 90 days past due are generally placed on nonaccrual status. Loans not yet reaching 90 days past due may be placed on nonaccrual status based on management s assessment of the aging of contractual principal amounts due, among other factors. For an aging analysis of the Company s loans held for investment as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, see Note 4 Loans Allowance for Credit Losses in the accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements. Non-performing assets include nonaccrual loans plus other real estate owned and repossessed vehicles. 
 Non-performing assets consisted of the following:

 Our non-performing assets increased to 177.4 million at September 30, 2024 from 115.8 million at June 30, 2024. The increase in non-performing assets during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily the result of an increase in nonaccrual loans of 63.3 million partially offset by a decrease in other real estate owned and repossessed vehicles of 1.7 million. Non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets increased to 0.75 at September 30, 2024 from 0.51 at June 30, 2024. 
 Available-for-Sale Securities 
 Total available-for-sale securities were 138.0 million as of September 30, 2024, compared with 141.6 million at June 30, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we purchased 16.0 million of securities and received principal repayments of 21.6 million. The remainder of the change for the available-for-sale portfolio is attributable to changes in the fair value of the securities.

 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had net cash inflows from operating activities of 70.8 million compared to inflows of 34.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net operating cash inflows and outflows fluctuate primarily due to the timing of the following: originations of loans held for sale, proceeds from loan sales, securities borrowed and loaned, and customer, broker-dealer and clearing receivables and payables and changes in other assets and payables. 
 Net cash outflows from investing activities totaled 45.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, while outflows totaled 506.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in outflows was primarily due to a decrease in net loan growth in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net cash inflows from financing activities totaled 592.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash inflows from financing activities of 503.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net cash inflows from financing is primarily driven by growth in deposits during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Bank could borrow up to 35 of its total assets from the FHLB. Borrowings are collateralized by pledging certain mortgage loans and available-for-sale securities to the FHLB. At September 30, 2024, the Company had 3,075.7 million available immediately and 4,284.2 million available with additional collateral and the Company had 4,680.7 million of loans and 0.8 million of securities pledged to the FHLB. At September 30, 2024, we had 250.0 million in unsecured federal funds lines of credit with five major banks under which there were no borrowings outstanding. 
 The Bank has the ability to borrow short-term from the FRBSF Discount Window. At September 30, 2024, the Bank did not have any borrowings outstanding and the amount available from this source was 6,879.4 million. Borrowings are collateralized by pledging commercial loans and consumer loans. At September 30, 2024, we had 8,194.2 million of loans pledged to the FRBSF. 
 Axos Clearing has a 150 million third-party secured line of credit available for borrowing, as needed. As of September 30, 2024, there was no amount outstanding on this credit facility. This credit facility bears interest at rates based on the Federal Funds rate and is due upon demand. 
 Axos Clearing has a 110 million third-party unsecured line of credit available for limited purpose borrowing. As of September 30, 2024, there was no amount outstanding on this credit facility. This credit facility bears interest at rates based on the Federal Funds rate and is due upon demand. 
 We view our liquidity sources to be stable and adequate for our anticipated needs and contingencies for both the short- and long-term. Due to the diversified sources of our deposits, while maintaining approximately 90 of our total Bank deposits in insured or collateralized accounts as of September 30, 2024, we believe we have the ability to increase our level of deposits, and have available other potential sources of funding, to address our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. 
 For additional information on certain contractual and other obligations, see Note 9 Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements and Note 12 Other Assets, and refer to Note 11 Deposits, Note 12 Advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank and Note 13 Borrowings, Subordinated Notes and Debentures in the 2024 Form 10-K.

 CAPITAL RESOURCES AND REQUIREMENTS 
 The Company and Bank are subject to regulatory capital adequacy requirements promulgated by federal bank regulatory agencies. Failure by the Company or Bank to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that could have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements for the Company and the OCC has similar requirements for our Bank. The following tables present regulatory capital information for the Company and Bank. Information presented for September 30, 2024 reflects the Basel III capital requirements for both the Company and Bank. Under these capital requirements and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company and Bank s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company s and Bank s capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. 
 Quantitative measures established by regulation require the Company and Bank to maintain certain minimum capital amounts and ratios. Federal bank regulators require the Company and Bank to maintain minimum ratios of tier 1 capital to adjusted average assets of 4.0 , common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5 , tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6.0 and total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0 . To be well capitalized, the Company and Bank must maintain minimum leverage, common equity tier 1 risk-based, tier 1 risk-based and total risk-based capital ratios of at least 5.0 , 6.5 , 8.0 and 10.0 , respectively. At September 30, 2024, the Company and Bank met all the capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject and were well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. Management believes that no conditions or events have occurred since September 30, 2024 that would materially adversely change the Company s and Bank s capital classifications. From time to time, we may need to raise additional capital to support the Company s and Bank s further growth and to maintain their well capitalized status. 
 The Company and Bank both elected the five-year current expected credit losses CECL transition guidance for calculating regulatory capital and ratios. The amounts in the following table reflect this election. This guidance allowed an entity to add back to regulatory capital 100 of the impact of the day-one CECL transition adjustment and 25 of subsequent increases to the allowance for credit losses through June 30, 2022. In fiscal year 2025, this cumulative amount is phased out of regulatory capital at 75 and the cumulative amount will be 100 phased out of regulatory capital beginning in fiscal year 2026.

 The Company s and Bank s capital ratios and requirements were as follows: 
 Axos Financial, Inc. Axos Bank Well Capitalized Ratio Minimum Capital Ratio (Dollars in thousands) 
 September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 Regulatory Capital: Tier 1 2,275,903 2,167,781 2,229,483 2,181,426 Common equity tier 1 2,275,903 2,167,781 2,229,483 2,181,426 Total capital 2,796,837 2,678,489 2,435,646 2,365,061 Assets: Average adjusted 23,267,418 22,979,871 22,711,795 22,391,541 Total risk-weighted 18,292,253 18,049,571 17,322,677 17,128,880 Regulatory Capital Ratios: Tier 1 leverage (to adjusted average assets) 9.78 9.43 9.82 9.74 5.00 4.00 Common equity tier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets) 12.44 12.01 12.87 12.74 6.50 4.50 Tier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets) 12.44 12.01 12.87 12.74 8.00 6.00 Total capital (to risk-weighted assets) 15.29 14.84 14.06 13.81 10.00 8.00 
 Basel III requires all banking organizations to maintain a capital conservation buffer above the minimum risk-based capital requirements in order to avoid certain limitations on capital distributions, stock repurchases and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The capital conservation buffer is exclusively composed of common equity tier 1 capital, and it applies to each of the three risk-based capital ratios but not the leverage ratio. At September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, our Company and Bank were in compliance with the capital conservation buffer requirement, which sets the common equity tier 1 risk-based, tier 1 risk-based and total risk-based capital ratio minimums to 7.0 , 8.5 and 10.5 , respectively. 
 Securities Business 
 Pursuant to the net capital requirements of the Exchange Act, Axos Clearing is subject to the SEC Uniform Net Capital (Rule 15c3-1 of the Exchange Act). Under this rule, the Company has elected to operate under the alternate method and is required to maintain minimum net capital of 250,000 or 2 of aggregate debit balances arising from client transactions, as defined. Under the alternate method, the Company may not repay subordinated debt, pay cash distributions, or make any unsecured advances or loans to its parent or employees if such payment would result in net capital of less than 5 of aggregate debit balances or less than 120 of its minimum dollar requirement. 
 The net capital position of Axos Clearing was as follows: 
 (Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 Net capital 85,292 101,462 Excess Capital 80,081 96,654 Net capital as a percentage of aggregate debit items 32.73 42.21 Net capital in excess of 5 aggregate debit items 72,264 89,442 
 Axos Clearing, as a clearing broker, is subject to the SEC Customer Protection Rule (Rule 15c3-3 of the Exchange Act) which requires segregation of funds in a special reserve account for the exclusive benefit of customers Customer Reserve Bank Account and proprietary accounts of brokers PAB Reserve Account ). As of September 30, 2024, Axos Clearing was in compliance with its Customer Reserve Bank Account and PAB Reserve Account deposit requirements.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 For further discussion of the Company s market risk, see Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in the 2024 Form 10-K. 
 We measure interest rate sensitivity as the difference between amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities that mature or contractually re-price within a given period of time. The difference, or the interest rate sensitivity gap, provides an indication of the extent to which an institution s interest rate spread will be affected by changes in interest rates. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities and negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets. 
 Absent any subsequent asset and liability actions by management, in a rising interest rate environment, an institution with a positive gap would be in a better position than an institution with a negative gap to invest in higher yielding assets or to have its asset yields adjusted upward, which would cause the yield on its assets to increase at a faster pace than the cost of its interest-bearing liabilities. Similarly, absent any subsequent asset and liability actions by management, during a period of falling interest rates, however, an institution with a positive gap would tend to have its assets reprice at a faster rate than one with a negative gap, which would tend to reduce the growth in its net interest income. 
 Banking Business Segment 
 Beginning September 30, 2024, the Company made certain refinements to its interest rate sensitivity analyses for the Banking Business Segment by moving the simulation framework to an industry leading cash flow engine. The change was implemented to enhance the process and better reflect the behavior of its interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities and provide improved granularity on key inputs and outputs used by the Company, including, but not limited to, prepayment and deposit beta assumptions. The modeled outputs as of September 30, 2024, when compared to those generated by applying the prior period methodology to the current period, do not result in significant changes to the previously disclosed interest rate sensitivities as of June 30, 2024. The reduced risk in the downward interest rate scenarios is primarily due to a change in deposit betas, which are now better aligned with the Company s expectations.

Table of Contents 

 The following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that were outstanding at September 30, 2024 and the portions of each financial instrument that are expected to mature or reset interest rates in each future period:

 1 Comprised of U.S. government securities, mortgage-backed securities and other securities. The table reflects contractual repricing dates. 
 2 Loans includes loan premiums, discounts and unearned fees. The table reflects either contractual repricing dates or expected maturities. 
 3 The table assumes that the principal balances for demand deposits and savings accounts will reprice in the first year. 
 
 The above table provides an approximation of the projected re-pricing of assets and liabilities at September 30, 2024 on the basis of contractual maturities, adjusted for anticipated prepayments of principal and scheduled rate adjustments. The loan and securities prepayment rates reflected herein are primarily based on modeled cash flows. For the non-maturity deposit liabilities, we use decay rates and rate adjustments based upon our historical experience and the implied forward rate curve, respectively. Actual repayments of these instruments could vary substantially if future experience differs from our historical experience. 
 Although gap analysis is a useful measurement device available to management in determining the existence of interest rate exposure, its static focus as of a particular date makes it necessary to utilize other techniques in measuring exposure to changes in interest rates. For example, gap analysis is limited in its ability to predict trends in future earnings and makes no assumptions about changes in prepayment tendencies, deposit or loan maturity preferences or repricing time lags that may occur in response to a change in the interest rate environment.

 The following table indicates the sensitivity of net interest income movements to parallel instantaneous shocks in interest rates for the future 1-12 months and 13-24 months time periods. For purposes of modeling net interest income sensitivity the Company assumes no growth in the balance sheet other than for retained earnings: 
 As of September 30, 2024 First 12 Months Next 12 Months (Dollars in thousands) Percentage Change from Base Percentage Change from Base Up 200 basis points 3.8 11.2 Up 100 basis points 
 1.8 5.3 Down 100 basis points 
 (1.1) (3.9) Down 200 basis points (0.7) (4.8) 
 We attempt to measure the effect market interest rate changes will have on the net present value of assets and liabilities, which is defined as market value of equity. We analyze the MVE sensitivity to an immediate parallel and sustained shift in interest rates derived from the underlying interest rate curves. 
 The following table indicates the sensitivity of MVE to the interest rate movement described above: 
 As of September 30, 2024 (Dollars in thousands) Percentage Change from Base Up 200 basis points (1.7) Up 100 basis points (0.3) Down 100 basis points (0.6) Down 200 basis points (1.0) 
 The computation of the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes is based on numerous assumptions, including relative levels of interest rates, asset prepayments, runoffs in deposits and changes in repricing levels of deposits to general market rates, and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. Furthermore, these computations do not take into account any actions that we may undertake in response to future changes in interest rates. Those actions include, but are not limited to, making changes in loan and deposit interest rates and changes in our asset and liability mix. 
 Securities Business Segment 
 Our Securities Business Segment is exposed to market risk primarily due to its role as a financial intermediary in customer transactions, which may include purchases and sales of securities, securities lending activities, and in our trading activities, which are used to support sales, underwriting and other customer activities. We are subject to the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, market prices, investor expectations and changes in credit ratings of the issuer. 
 Our Securities Business Segment is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of maintaining inventories of interest rate sensitive financial instruments and other interest-earning assets including customer and correspondent margin loans and securities borrowing activities. Our exposure to interest rate risk is also from our funding sources including customer and correspondent cash balances, bank borrowings and securities lending activities. Interest rates on customer and correspondent balances and securities produce a positive spread with rates generally fluctuating in parallel. 
 With respect to securities held, our interest rate risk is managed by setting and monitoring limits on the size and duration of positions and on the length of time securities can be held. The majority of the interest rates on customer and correspondent margin loans are indexed and can vary daily. Our funding sources are generally short term with interest rates that can vary daily. 
 As of September 30, 2024, Axos Clearing held municipal obligations classified as trading securities and had maturities greater than 10 years. 
 Our Securities Business Segment is engaged in various brokerage and trading activities that expose us to credit risk arising from potential non-performance from counterparties, customers or issuers of securities. This risk is managed by setting and monitoring position limits for each counterparty, conducting periodic credit reviews of counterparties, reviewing concentrations of securities and conducting business through central clearing organizations.

 Collateral underlying margin loans to customers and correspondents and with respect to securities lending activities is marked to market daily and additional collateral is obtained or refunded, as necessary. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 The Company s management, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer along with our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In addition, there were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting. 
 Management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods is subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
