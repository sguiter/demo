Fair Value Measurements 
 Our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates their carrying values because of the short-term nature of these instruments, which are all considered Level 1 . 
 Our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of equity securities, corporate b onds, U.S. treasury securities and derivatives. U.S. treasury securities and equity securities are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy as they are valued based on quoted market price in an active market. Corporate bonds and derivative instruments are valued based on quoted prices in markets that are less active, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative pricing sources that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data are generally classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Financial instruments valued based on unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions or data that market participants would use in valuing an instrument are generally classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. We did not hold Level 3 financial instruments as of April 30, 2024 , and December 31, 2023 .

(approximately million) representing the amount of such withholding tax that was imposed on LGE, which provisional deposit would be returned to us to the extent we ultimately prevail in the appeal in the Korean courts. In the second quarter of 2020 , we recorded this deposit in Long-term deposits on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets . In the fourth quarter of 2021 , we recorded an impairment charge of million related to the long-term deposits paid to LGE. 
 On November 3, 2017, on behalf of LGE, we filed an appeal with the Korea Tax Tribunal regarding their findings with respect to the withholding taxes related to the 2012 to 2017 period. The Korea Tax Tribunal hearing took place on March 5, 2019. On March 19, 2019, the Korea Tax Tribunal issued its ruling in which it decided not to accept our arguments with respect to the Korean tax authorities assessment of withholding tax and penalties imposed on LGE. On behalf of LGE, we filed an appeal with the Korea Administrative Court on June 10, 2019. We have had numerous hearings before the Korea Administrative Court in the years 2019 through 2022 . We had a hearing on April 27, 2023, and the Korea Administrative Court rendered a decision on this matter on June 8, 2023, in which it ruled that the withholding taxes and penalties which were imposed by the Korean tax authorities on LGE should be cancelled with litigation costs to be borne by the Korean tax authorities. In connection with the Korea Administrative Court s decision, the Korean tax authorities filed an appeal on June 28, 2023, with the Seoul High Court to seek the cancellation of the lower court s decision. The appellate case is in progress at the Seoul High Court and the first and the second hearings took place on November 30, 2023 and February 1, 2024, respectively. However, the next hearing will be set at a later date. 

On April 25, 2023, we received notice from LGE requesting us to reimburse LGE with respect to withholding tax imposed on LGE by the Korean tax authorities following a recent tax audit of LGE for the years 2018 through 2022 . Pursuant to an agreement reached with LGE, on June 2, 2023, we provided a provisional deposit to LGE in the amount of KRW (approximately million) representing the amount of such withholding tax that was imposed on LGE, which provisional deposit would be returned to us to the extent we ultimately prevail in the appeal in the Korean courts. In the second quarter of 2023 , we recorded this deposit in Long-term deposits on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets . On June 29, 2023, on behalf of LGE, we filed an appeal with the Korea Tax Tribunal regarding their findings with respect to the withholding taxes related to the 2018 to 2022 period. On August 7, 2023, the Korean tax authority submitted its answer against the tax appeal. On September 8, 2023, on behalf of LGE, the Company submitted its rebuttal brief in response thereto. On September 25, 2023, Korean tax authority submitted an additional response brief, and on November 23, 2023, the Korea Tax Tribunal rendered a decision against LGE, dismissing the claims of the Company on the grounds that its claims are without merit. In response thereto, on behalf of LGE, we filed an appeal with the Korea Administrative Court on December 29, 2023. O n July 23, 2024, the Korea Tax Tribunal rendered a decision against LGE, and deadline for the court appeal of the local income claim is October 21, 2024. In addition, the Korea Administrative Court scheduled a hearing date of August 29, 2024, which was cancelled and will be rescheduled at a later date. On October 18, 2024, the Company filed a complaint and a brief with the Korea Administrative Court for the local income tax appeal. As of April 30, 2024 , we have accrued million of withholding taxes, interest and penalties related to the 2018 to 2022 period for which the Korean tax authorities have recently assessed LGE. These withholding taxes have been reclassified and reported as an impairment reduction to the Long-term deposit made in the third quarter of 2023 in order to present the deposit at its estimated recoverable value. 

Based on th e developments in these cases, we regularly reassess the likelihood that we will prevail in the claims from the Korean tax authorities with respect to the LGE case. To the extent that we determine that it is more likely than not that we will prevail against the claims from the Korean tax authorities, then no additional tax expense is provided for in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income . In the event that we determine that it is more likely than not that we will not prevail against the claims from the Korean tax authorities, or a portion thereof, then we would estimate the anticipated additional tax expense associated with that outcome and record it as additional income tax expense in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income in the period of the new determination. If the additional income tax expense was related to the periods assessed by Korean tax authorities and for which we recorded a Long-term deposits on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets , then the additional income tax expense would be recorded as an impairment to the Long-term deposits . If the additional income tax expense was not related to the periods assessed by Korean tax authorities and for which we recorded in Long-term deposits on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets , then the additional income tax expense would be accrued as an Other current liabilities . 

In the event that we do not ultimately prevail in our appeal in the Korean courts with respect to this case, the applicable deposits included in Long-term deposits would be recorded as additional income tax expense on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income , in the period in which we do not ultimately prevail. 

Immersion Corporation vs. Meta Platforms, Inc., f/k/a Facebook, Inc. Meta 
 On May 26, 2022, we filed a complaint against Meta in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The complaint alleges that Meta s augmented and virtual reality AR/VR systems, including the Meta Quest 2 , infringe six of our patents that cover various uses of haptic effects in connection with such AR/VR systems.

million of our common stock for a period of up to twelve months (the December 2022 Stock Repurchase Program ), which terminated and superseded the stock repurchase program that had been approved by the Board on February 23, 2022. Any stock repurchases may be made through open market and privately negotiated transactions, at such times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate, including pursuant to one or more Rule 10 b 5 - 1 trading plans adopted in accordance with Rule 10 b 5 - 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , as amended. Additionally, the Board authorized the use of any derivative or similar instrument to effect stock repurchase transactions, including without limitation, accelerated share repurchase contracts, equity forward transactions, equity option transactions, equity swap transactions, cap transactions, collar transactions, naked put options, floor transactions or other similar transactions or any combination of the foregoing transactions. The December 2022 Stock Repurchase Program was implemented as a method to return value to our stockholders. The timing, pricing and sizes of any repurchases will depend on a number of factors, including the market price of our common stock and general market and economic conditions. The December 2022 Stock Repurchase Program does not obligate us to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares, and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. On August 8, 2023, the Board approved an amendment to extend the expiration date of the December 2022 Stock Repurchase Program that was set to expire on Dec ember 29 , 2023 to December 29, 2024 .

Provision for income taxes 

Effective tax rate 

Provision for income taxes for the four months ended April 30, 2024 and the three months ended March 31, 2023 resulted primarily from estimated domestic and foreign taxes included in the calculation of the effective tax rate . 
 We provided no valuation allowance for federal deferred tax assets, whose future realization is more likely than not and continue to maintain full valuation allowance for certain state deferred tax assets in the United States as well as federal tax assets in Canada. Changes in provision for income taxes resulted primarily from the change in income from continuing operations across various tax jurisdictions. 
 In the event that we determine the deferred tax assets are realizable based on an assessment of relevant factors, an adjustment to the valuation allowance may increase income in the period such determination is made. The valuation allowance does not impact our ability to utilize the underlying net operating loss carryforwards. We also maintain liabilities for uncertain tax positions. 
 As of April 30, 2024 , we had unrecognized tax benefits of approximately million of which million could be payable in cash. In addition, interest and penalty of million could also be payable in cash in relation to unrecognized tax benefits. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect our effective tax rate, if recognized, is million. We account for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax provision. We do not expect to have any significant changes to unrecognized tax benefits during the next twelve months. 
 
 As of April 30, 2024 , we had net deferred income tax assets of million. Because we have net operating loss and credit carryforwards, there are open statutes of limitations in which federal, state, and foreign taxing authorities may examine our tax returns for all years from 2008 through the current period.

Weighted average shares outstanding, diluted 

We include PSUs in the calculation of diluted earnings per share if the applicable performance condition has been satisfied as of the end of the reporting period and exclude stock equity awards if the performance condition has not been met. 
 
 For the four months ended April 30, 2024 , we had outstanding RSUs, PSUs and RSAs outstanding that could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future, but these were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. For the three months ended March 31, 2023 , we had outstanding stock options and outstanding awards that could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future, but these were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.

Trade name represent Barnes Noble Education s right to its trade name on a perpetual, royalty-free basis as it existed on the acquisition closing date. Customer relationships consist of distinct value associated with Barnes Noble Education's large operating footprint with direct access to students and faculty across a diverse customer base. 
 
 The Company used the assistance of a third-party firm to estimate the fair value of the intangible assets acquired. The Company used an income approach to estimate the fair values of the trade names and customer relationships. The fair values assigned to identifiable intangible assets were determined through the use of the income approach, specifically the relief from royalty and the multi-period excess earnings methods. The major assumptions used to estimate the values of identifiable intangible assets include management s estimates of future revenue, adjusted for growth and attrition based on historical data and management's forward-looking expectations. 
 
 These cash flows were discounted at a rate of , which reflects the Company s cost of equity. The useful lives for intangible assets were determined based upon the remaining useful economic lives of the intangible assets that are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to future cash flows. 
 
 Goodwill generated from this acquisition is primarily attributed to the value of Barnes Noble Education's assembled workforce. Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company s entire goodwill balance is associated with the Barnes Noble Education reporting unit. Goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. 
 
 The Company acquired a deferred tax asset of million, recorded and a deferred tax liability of million, recorded under Deferred tax liabilities, net noncurrent, as part of this business combination, as shown in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. 
 
 The Company also engaged a third-party valuation firm to estimate the fair value of the property and equipment and inventory acquired. The fair value as of the Closing Date reflects a step-up in basis due to the highly depreciable nature of the property and equipment. No material fair value adjustments for inventory were identified, as there are minimal costs associated with procurement. 
 
 Most of the net tangible assets were valued at their respective carrying amounts as of the acquisition date, as the Company believes that these amounts approximate their current fair values. The leases acquired were recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. 
 
 The acquired entity s results of operations were included in the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition, June 10, 2024, as adjusted for specific fair value adjustments discussed above.

 Change in Reporting Period 
 
 In order to more closely align the year ends, on September 27, 2024, the Board of Directors of Immersion (the Board approved a change of our fiscal year from the period beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31 to the period beginning on May 1 and ending on April 30. As a result of the change in fiscal year end, we are filing this Transition Report on Form 10-QT for the period from January 1, 2024 through April 30, 2024 , referred to herein as the transition period . We did not recast the consolidated financial statements for the period from January 1 to April 30, 2023 because the financial reporting processes in place at that time included certain procedures that were completed only on a quarterly basis. Consequently, to recast this period would have been impractical and would not have been cost-justified. As a result, the financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 are presented as the most nearly comparable quarter of the prior fiscal year. 
 
 Subsequent to this report, our fiscal year will begin on May 1 and end on April 30. Our new fiscal quarters end on July 31, October 31, January 31 and April 30. Therefore, the financial results of certain fiscal quarters may not be comparable to prior fiscal quarters. 
 For this this Transition Report on Form 10-QT, we are reporting the four months ended April 30, 2024 as compared to the 3 months ended March 31, 2023 .

Provision for income taxes for the four months ended April 30, 2024 and the three months ended March 31, 2023 resulted primarily from estimated domestic and foreign taxes included in the calculation of the effective tax rate. 
 We provided no valuation allowance for federal assets, whose future realization is more likely than not and continue to maintain full valuation allowance for state deferred tax assets in the United States as well as federal tax assets in Canada. The year-over-year change in provision for income taxes resulted primarily from the change in income from continuing operations across various tax jurisdictions. 
 We continue to maintain full valuation allowance for state and certain foreign deferred tax assets in the United States and Canada as a result of uncertainties regarding the realization of the asset balance due to historical losses, the variability of operating results, and uncertainty regarding near term projected results. In the event that we determine the deferred tax assets are realizable based on an assessment of relevant factors, an adjustment to the valuation allowance may increase income in the period such determination is made. The valuation allowance does not impact our ability to utilize the underlying net operating loss carryforwards. 

We also maintain liabilities for uncertain tax positions. As of April 30, 2024 , we had unrecognized tax benefits under ASC 740 Income Taxes of approximately 7.6 million, of which 7.1 million could be payable in cash. In addition, interest and penalty 0.2 million could also be payable in cash in relation to the unrecognized tax benefits. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect our effective tax rate, if recognized, is 7.1 million. We account for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax provision. We do not expect to have any significant changes to unrecognized tax benefits during the next twelve months.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those related to revenue recognition, marketable securities and derivative instruments, income taxes and contingencies. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. 

Please refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 , filed with the SEC on March 11, 2024, for a complete discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP and our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and operating results require the management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. See Note 1 . Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 herein, which describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.

Item 3 . Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

 Not applicable. 
 Item 4 . Control and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Based on their evaluation as of April 30, 2024 , our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13 a- 15 (e) and 15 d- 15 (e) under the Exchange Act) were effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in this Transition Report on Form 10-QT was (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and regulations and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
 There were no changes to internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the four months ended April 30, 2024 , that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations of Internal Controls 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Immersion, have been detected.

 LGE Korean Withholding Tax Matter 
 
 On October 16, 2017, we received a letter
from LG Electronics Inc. LGE requesting that we reimburse LGE with respect
to withholding tax imposed on LGE by the Korean tax authorities following an
investigation where the tax authority determined that LGE failed to withhold on
LGE s royalty payments to Immersion Software Ireland Limited from 2012 to
2014. Pursuant to an agreement reached with LGE, on April 8, 2020, the
Company provided a provisional deposit to LGE in the amount of KRW 5,916,845,454
(approximately 5.0 million) representing the amount of such withholding tax
that was imposed on LGE, which provisional deposit would be returned to us to
the extent we ultimately prevail in the appeal in the Korea courts. 
 
 On November 3, 2017, on behalf of LGE, we
filed an appeal with the Korea Tax Tribunal regarding their findings with
respect to the withholding taxes related to the 2012 to 2017 period. The Korea
Tax Tribunal hearing took place on March 5, 2019. On March 19, 2019, the Korea
Tax Tribunal issued its ruling in which it decided not to accept our arguments
with respect to the Korean tax authorities assessment of withholding tax and
penalties imposed on LGE. On behalf of LGE, the Company filed an appeal with the
Korea Administrative Court on June 10, 2019. The Company has had numerous

rendered a decision on this matter on June 8, 2023, in which it ruled that the
withholding taxes and penalties which were imposed by the Korean tax
authorities on LGE should be cancelled with litigation costs to be borne by the
Korean tax authorities. In connection with the Korea Administrative
Court s decision, the Korean tax authorities filed an appeal on June 28, 2023,
with the Seoul High Court to seek the cancellation of the lower court s
decision. The appellate case is in progress at the Seoul High Court and the
first hearing and the hearing took place on November 30, 2023 and February
1, 2024, respectively. However, the next hearing will be set at a later date.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors 

There have been no material changes to the risk
factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 , filed with the SEC on March 11,
2024, except as set forth below. You should carefully consider the risk factors
described in Barnes Noble Education, Inc. s Annual Reports on Form 10-K
and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q which are filed with the SEC and are
available at www.sec.gov. 
 Our consolidated
subsidiary, Barnes Noble Education, is a public company which may expose
us to additional costs, and our management may be required to devote
substantial time to compliance initiatives. 
 On June 10, 2024, we
acquired ownership of approximately 42.0 of the common stock of Barnes 
Noble Education and as a public company, with a consolidated subsidiary that is
also a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses
to comply with the requirements applicable to public companies. Many of our
personnel and other resources are devoted to ensuring we, and Barnes 
Noble Education, comply with requirements applicable to public companies. This
further exhausts management and other personnel resources that could be used
for other revenue-generating activities.

 Table of Contents 

Changes in Barnes Noble Education s relationships with significant clients and suppliers, including the loss or reduction in business from one or more of them, could have a material adverse impact on its business. 
 
 The products that Barnes Noble Education sells originate from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors. During fiscal 2024, Barnes Noble Education s four largest retail suppliers, excluding its wholesale business which fulfills orders for all its physical and virtual bookstores, accounted for approximately 28 of its merchandise purchased, with the largest supplier accounting for approximately 7 of its merchandise purchased. Barnes Noble Education s wholesale business sources over 95 of its inventory from two primary channels, approximately 55 from third-party suppliers and approximately 40 from retail bookstores (including its retail bookstores). Suppliers may modify the terms of these relationships due to general economic conditions or otherwise or, especially with respect to wholesale inventory, publishers could terminate distribution to wholesalers, including Barnes Noble Education s wholesale business. 

Barnes Noble
Education does not have long-term arrangements with most of its suppliers to
guarantee availability of merchandise, content or services, particular payment
terms or the extension of credit limits. If Barnes Noble Education s current
suppliers were to stop selling merchandise, content or services to it on
acceptable terms, including as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies
due to poor economic conditions or refusal by such suppliers to ship products
to us due to delayed or extended payment windows as a result of Barnes 
Noble Education s own liquidity constraints, Barnes Noble Education may
be unable to procure the same merchandise, content or services from other
suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all.
Additionally, delayed or incomplete publisher shipments of physical textbook
orders, or delays in receiving digital courseware access codes, could have an
adverse impact on sales, including Barnes Noble Education s BNC
First Day Complete equitable access program, which relies upon timely receipt
of inventory in advance of class start dates each academic term. 
 
 Furthermore, certain of
Barnes Noble Education s merchandise is sourced indirectly from outside the
United States. Political or financial instability, merchandise quality issues,
product safety concerns, trade restrictions, work stoppages, tariffs, foreign
currency exchange rates, transportation capacity and costs, inflation, civil
unrest, natural disasters, public health crises, epidemics, and pandemics, and
other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond its control and could
disrupt its supply of foreign-sourced merchandise. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

 Stock Repurchase Program 
 On December 29, 2022, our Board approved a stock repurchase program of up to 50.0 million of our common stock for a period of up to twelve months (the December 2022 Stock Repurchase Program ), which terminated and superseded the stock repurchase program that had been approved by the Board on February 23, 2022. Any stock repurchases may be made through open market and privately negotiated transactions, at such times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate, including pursuant to one or more Rule 10 b 5 - 1 trading plans adopted in accordance with Rule 10 b 5 - 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , as amended. Additionally, the Board authorized the use of any derivative or similar instrument to effect stock repurchase transactions, including without limitation, accelerated share repurchase contracts, equity forward transactions, equity option transactions, equity swap transactions, cap transactions, collar transactions, naked put options, floor transactions or other similar transactions or any combination of the foregoing transactions. The December 2022 Stock Repurchase Program was implemented as a method to return value to our stockholders. The timing, pricing and sizes of any repurchases will depend on a number of factors, including the market price of our common stock and general market and economic conditions. The December 2022 Stock Repurchase Program does not obligate us to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares, and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. On August 8, 2023, the Board approved an amendment to extend the expiration date of the December 2022 Stock Repurchase Program that was set to expire on December 29, 2023 to December 29, 2024. 
 During 2023 , we
repurchased 1,217,774 shares of our common stock for
 8.3 million at an average purchase price of 6.77 per share. We
did not repurchase any stock during the four months ended April 30, 2024 . As of April 30, 2024 , we had 41.7 million available for
repurchase under the December 2022 Stock Repurchase Program.
