 segment. The Company offers short-term (i.e., one to ), secured, non-bank loans (sometimes referred to as hard money loans) to real estate owners and investors to fund their acquisition, renovation, development, rehabilitation or improvement of properties located primarily in the northeastern and southeastern sections of the United States. The properties securing the Company s loans are generally classified as residential or commercial real estate and, typically, are held for resale or investment. Each loan is secured by a first mortgage lien on real estate and may also be secured with additional collateral, such as other real estate owned by the borrower or its principals, a pledge of the ownership interests in the borrower by the principals thereof, and/or personal guarantees by the principals of the borrower. The Company does not lend to owner occupants of residential real estate. The Company s primary underwriting criteria is a conservative loan-to-value LTV ratio. In addition, the Company may participate in real estate loans made by third parties or invest in third parties that make real estate loans, as well as make opportunistic real estate purchases apart from its lending activities.

 million was recorded effective January 1, 2023 as a cumulative-effect of change in accounting principle through a direct charge to accumulated deficit on the consolidated statements of shareholders equity. Subsequent changes to the CECL allowance will be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in Provision for credit losses related to loans . The Company records an Allowance for credit losses on the consolidated balance sheets with respect to its loan portfolio, including unfunded construction commitments, on a collective basis by assets with similar risk characteristics. This methodology, known as the static pool methodology, replaces the probable incurred loss impairment methodology. In addition, interest and fees receivable and amounts included in due from borrowers, other than reimbursements, which include origination, modification and other fees receivable are also analyzed for credit losses in accordance with ASU 2016-13, as they represent a financial asset that is subject to credit risk. As allowed under the CECL standard used by the Company, as a practical expedient, the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date is compared to the net carrying amount of the loan when determining the allowance for credit losses for loans in pending/pre-foreclosure status, as defined. Fair value of collateral is reduced by estimated cost to sell if the collateral is expected to be sold. The aggregate outstanding principal balance and the accrued but unpaid interest and borrower charges of loans in pending/pre-foreclosure as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was million and million, respectively.

 to . Tenant allowances are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lives of the related leases, or the useful lives of the assets. Upon the acquisition of real estate, the Company assesses whether the transaction should be accounted for as an asset acquisition or as a business combination. Acquisitions of integrated sets of assets and activities that do not meet the definition of a business are accounted for as asset acquisitions. Acquisitions of real estate generally will not meet the definition of a business because substantially all of the fair value is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets (i.e., land, buildings, and related identified intangible assets). The Company allocates the purchase price of real estate to land and building (inclusive of site and tenant improvements) and, if determined to be material, intangibles, such as the value of above- and below-market leases and origination costs associated with the in-place leases. The allocation of the purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves subjectivity as the allocations are based on an analysis of the respective fair values. In determining the fair value of the real estate acquired, the Company utilized a third-party valuation which primarily utilizes cash flow projections that apply, among other things, estimated revenue and expense growth rates, discount rates and capitalization rates, as well as sales comparison approach, which utilizes comparable sales, listings and sales contracts. The Company assesses the fair value of the acquired leases based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions that may affect the property. The determined and allocated fair values to the real estate acquired will affect the amount of depreciation and amortization we record over the respective estimated useful lives or term of the lease. On June 23, 2023, the Company entered into a purchase and sale contract (the Westport Purchase Agreement to acquire a commercial office building in Westport, CT (the Westport Asset for million. The transaction was completed on August 31, 2023. In connection with this transaction, which was accounted for as an asset acquisition, the Company allocated the purchase price and acquisition-related costs to the tangible and intangible assets acquired based on fair value. In addition, the Company recorded a lease liability stemming from below-market rental rates. Total consideration, including capitalized acquisition-related costs, was million. See Note 6 Investment in Rental Real Estate, net for further details surrounding the above acquisition as of September 30, 2024.

 and million, respectively, which is represented in other expenses on the Company s consolidated statements of operations. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, there were recognized provisions for federal income tax nor state tax. The income tax provision for the Company differs from the amount computed from applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income before income taxes due to non-taxable REIT income and other permanent differences including the non-deductibility of acquisition costs of business combinations for federal income tax reporting. ASC Sub-Topic 740-10 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosure required. Under this standard, an entity may only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a more likely than not threshold. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense. The Company has determined that there are uncertain tax positions requiring accrual or disclosure in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024 and 2023. and outstanding , resulting in basic and diluted losses per share of and , respectively .

 borrower representing and of the outstanding mortgage loan portfolio, or million and million, respectively. The Company may agree to extend the term of a loan if, at the time of the extension, the loan and the borrower meet all the Company s then underwriting requirements. The Company treats a loan extension as a new loan. If an interest reserve is established at the time a loan is funded, accrued interest is paid out of the interest reserve and recognized as interest income at the end of each month. If no reserve is established, the borrower is required to pay the interest monthly from its own funds. The deferred origination, loan servicing and amendment fee income represents amounts that will be recognized over the contractual life of the underlying mortgage notes receivable. Allowance for Credit Losses Allowance for credit losses are charged to income in amounts sufficient to maintain an allowance for credit losses inherent in the loans that are established systematically by management as of the reporting date. Management s estimate of expected credit losses is based on an evaluation of relevant information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the future collectability of the reported amounts. The Company uses static pool modeling techniques to determine the allowance for loan losses expected over the remaining life of the loans, which is supplemented by management s judgment. Expected credit losses are estimated for groups of accounts aggregated by geographical location. The Company s estimate of expected credit losses includes a reasonable and supportable forecast period equal to the contractual term of the loan plus any applicable short-term extensions that are reasonably expected for construction loans. The Company reviews charge-off experience factors, contractual delinquency, historical collection rates, the value of underlying collateral and other information to make the necessary judgments as to allowance for credit losses expected in the portfolio as of the reporting date. While management utilizes the best information available to make its evaluations, changes in macroeconomic conditions, interest rate environments, or both, may significantly impact the assumptions and inputs used in determining the allowance for credit losses. The Company s charge-off policy is determined by a review of each delinquent loan. The Company has an accounting policy to not place loans on nonaccrual status unless they are more than 90 days delinquent. Accrual of interest income is generally resumed when the delinquent contractual principal and interest is paid in full or when a portion of the delinquent contractually payments are made, and the ongoing required contractual payments have been made for an appropriate period. In assessing the allowance for credit losses, the Company considers historical loss experience, current conditions, and a reasonable and supportable forecast of the macroeconomic environment. The Company derived an annual historical loss rate based on its historical loss experience in its portfolio, adjusted to incorporate the risks of construction lending, other specific circumstances, and to reflect the Company s expectations of the macroeconomic environment.

The balance of the purchase price is due and payable on or before September 6, 2025. If the Company fails to make the deferred payment when due, it will forfeit half of its interest in Shem and all proceeds received therefrom, if any. In addition, the Company has the right to acquire an additional interest in Shem (increasing its stake to in separate options of million and million at any time prior to March 31, 2027. The Company is allowed one board member of Shem, but has no management rights in Shem. The Company accounts for these investments at cost because the Company does not manage the entities in which it holds an interest and thus has no control or have significant influence over the investments. Shem is a commercial real estate finance company that provides debt capital solutions to local and regional commercial real estate owners in the Northeastern United States. The Company s withdrawal from each limited liability company may only be granted by Shem. The Company s investments can be categorized into three fund structures: fund investments, direct loan investments (co-invest vehicles) and the manager investment. The fund investments primarily include investments in two entities that invest in mortgage loans. The direct loan investments are through three entities whereby the Company directly invests in the participation of individual loans. Both the fund and direct loan structure primarily invest in mortgage loans to borrowers with a majority of the deals being leveraged by a bank. These loans are primarily two- to three- year collateralized mortgage loans, often with contractual extension options for the borrowers of an additional year. The Company receives quarterly distributions from the entities that are comprised of a preferred return, return of capital, and the incentive fee depending on each loan s waterfall calculation, as defined by the loan agreements. The Company s interests in the entities are not redeemable at any time, as its investment will be repaid as the underlying loans are repaid. The Company expects to be repaid on its current investments by December 31, 2027. Shem s compensation includes senior financing fees, incentive fees, and management fees that are charged to each entity that it manages, including the seven entities in which the Company has an investment. The Company expects to receive quarterly distributions from the respective entities operating cash flows. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Shem investments generated, in the aggregate, million and million, respectively, of income for the Company. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Shem investments generated million and million, respectively, of income for the Company.

 million. A majority of the loans offered for sale are designated by the Company as non-accrual loans, which means payments due under such loans are more than 90 days in arrears. The sale process formally commenced in early October when Mission began to solicit indications of interest from potential buyers. Indications of Interest were due by November 5, 2024. Final bids are due by December 4, 2024. The Company expects to consummate the sale before December 31, 2024.

 Item 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion of the Company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Report. Certain statements in this discussion and elsewhere in this Report constitute forward-looking statements, within the meaning of section 21E of the Exchange Act, that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual operating results and financial conditions may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. Company Overview We are a Connecticut-based real estate finance company that specializes in originating, underwriting, funding, servicing and managing a portfolio of short-term (i.e., three years or less) loans secured by first mortgage liens on real property. From our inception in December 2010, through our initial public offering, in February 2017, we operated as a limited liability company. On February 9, 2017, we completed our initial public offering (the IPO ), the primary purpose of which was to raise equity capital to fund mortgage loans and expand our mortgage loan portfolio and to diversify our ownership so that we could qualify, for federal income tax purposes, as a real estate investment trust, or REIT. We believe that, since consummation of the IPO, we meet all the requirements to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes and elected to be taxed as a REIT beginning with our 2017 tax year. As a REIT, we are entitled to claim deductions for distributions of taxable income to our shareholders thereby eliminating any corporate tax on such taxable income. Any taxable income not distributed to shareholders is subject to tax at the regular corporate tax rates and may also be subject to a 4 excise tax to the extent it exceeds 10 of our total taxable income. To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we are required to distribute each year at least 90 of our taxable income. As a REIT, we may also be subject to federal excise taxes and state taxes. Review of the First Nine Months of 2024 and Outlook for Balance of Year For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue declined by 3.3 compared to the comparable 2023 period. In addition, for the 2024 period we reported a net loss attributable to common shareholders of 6.6 million compared to net income attributable to common shareholders of 14.2 million for the comparable 2023 period. The decrease in revenue and the swing from net income to net loss were driven by several factors. The primary factor was a 18.0 million provision for credit losses in 2024, compared to 65,000 in 2023. This increase was mainly due to declines in the value of assets securing the mortgage loans in our portfolio. Provisions for credit losses, including impairment losses, are non-cash charges and do not affect taxable income and distributable earnings as a result. The second factor was a 32.1 decrease in loan originations, which negatively impacted both interest and fee income from loans. This decline was primarily due to our inability to raise growth capital amid challenging macroeconomic conditions. The third factor was a 35.5 rise in general and administrative expenses, mainly from increased legal and advisory fees related to shareholder activism. The fourth factor was a 90.1 increase in other expenses, primarily driven by higher tax expenses from our taxable REIT subsidiary. On a positive note, income from partnership investments rose 67.1 , and interest expense, along with amortization of deferred financing costs, decreased by 1.9 , following the repayment of our unsubordinated notes in June 2024. Looking ahead to the remainder of 2024, further write-downs related to loans are possible, along with continued declines in interest and fee income due to ongoing challenges in the real estate and capital markets. However, we anticipate general administrative expenses will return to more typical levels, and other expenses should stabilize. Additionally, a tranche of our unsecured subordinated five-year notes, totaling 34.5 million, is due on December 30, 2024. While the repayment of these notes will not impact interest expense or amortization for the remainder of this year, it will reduce these costs in 2025. We expect to meet the repayment obligation using cash flow from operations, additional borrowings under existing credit facilities, and proceeds from the sale of a portion of our loan portfolio (details to be discussed further below). Our overall business strategy is as follows: capitalize on opportunities created by the long-term structural changes in the real estate lending market and the continuing lack of liquidity in the commercial and investment real estate markets; take advantage of the prevailing economic environment and current economic, political and social trends that may impact real estate lending, as well as the outlook for real estate in general and particular asset classes; 

 33 

Table of Contents 
 remain flexible to capitalize on changing sets of investment opportunities that may be present in the various points of an economic cycle; continue to improve operational efficiencies and reduce general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue; maintain our status as a publicly-held company, subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, which gives us immediate access to the public markets for much-needed capital; and operate to qualify as a REIT and for an exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. 
 We believe that the following factors are the major challenges confronting us for the remainder of 2024: High interest rate environment. The rates on our existing credit facilities, including the Churchill Facility and the New NHB Mortgage (as defined below), have all increased. The effective rate of Needham Bank Credit Facility was 7.75 , and Churchill Facility was 8.95 as of September 30, 2024. In addition, the interest rate on the September 2027 Notes, our last note offering in 2022, was 8.0 , the highest it has ever been. Although interest rates have started to come down recently, we expect interest rates to remain elevated for the remainder of 2024 and into 2025. Capital markets illiquidity . Our last underwritten public offering was in August 2022. Since then, our sole source of working capital has been interest and principal payments on our existing loan portfolio, our existing credit facilities (Churchill and Needham) and intermittent sales under our at-the-market offering facility. Rates have began to ease but the current U.S. 10 Year Treasury Yield would indicate rates are expected to stay elevated for longer than anticipated. Global and domestic political concerns. 2023 and early 2024 was marked with various geopolitical concerns, including the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia, and Israel, Hamas, Hezbollah and other Iranian proxies, heightened tensions between the U.S. and China regarding Taiwan and global trade, Iran s and North Korea s continued pursuit of nuclear weapons and Iran s ongoing attempts to destabilize the Middle East. These conflicts have led to market volatility, spikes in commodity prices, supply chain interruptions, heightened cybersecurity concerns and general concerns that it might lead to unconventional warfare. The true ramifications of these conflicts and their impact on the markets and our business operations, specifically our borrowers and real estate prices, are not fully known at this time. Our business is purely domestic, but our Company and our borrowers are impacted by the uncertainty created by world events and unexpected market volatility. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of this year, the United States had a presidential election pursuant to which a new president was elected. The new president and his administration is expected to take office in January 2025 and his policies and priorities remain to be seen. Increased competition from private lenders. In the past, our primary competitors were other non-bank real estate finance companies and banks and other financial institutions. More recently, we are encountering competition from private equity funds, hedge funds and other specialty finance entities funded by investment banks, asset managers, private equity funds and hedge funds. The primary driver for these new market participants, we believe, is their need to find higher yielding investments. Given that residential transition loan gross yields are in the 12-15 range, many institutions are deploying capital into credit products where the returns are nearing equity investments. These entities, in general, are well-funded, have relatively easy access to capital and are aggressive in terms of pricing. In addition, competition is becoming more of a factor as we implement our strategy to focus on larger loans and more sophisticated borrowers. Given recent developments regarding mid-size regional banks, we believe competition from traditional banks will continue to abate in 2024 rather than increase. However, as traditional banks exit the lending market, non-traditional lenders, such as non-bank real estate companies, hedge funds, private equity funds and insurance companies, are likely to step into the void. Our principal competitive advantages include our experience, our reputation, our size and our ability to address the needs of borrowers in terms of timing and structuring loan transactions. Property value fluctuations and declines. We monitor a variety of indicators to track property value trends, including the Federal Funds Rate, U.S Treasury data, days-on-market, pending sales, NAHB s Housing Market Index and Co-Star reports. Additionally, we primarily utilize third-party valuations including, but not limited to, appraisals, broker price opinions, automated valuation models, and internal valuations to assist in both our underwriting and monitoring of our portfolio assets. Nevertheless, property value market cycles could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial condition. Over the past two years, the commercial real estate market throughout most of the United States has experienced a significant decline in value, which has led to a corresponding increase in the rate of loan defaults and foreclosures. As a result, many REITs have been forced to record additional 

 34 

Table of Contents 
 allowances for credit losses and write-downs of real estate assets. Although many of our loans are secured by residential properties, 28.0 of our portfolio is secured by commercial real estate and, hence, we are not immune from this trend. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate the allowance for credit losses by analyzing several market indicators indicated above and adjust accordingly. Our total allowance for credit losses related to mortgage loans as of September 30, 2024 was 27.2 million. Our total provisions for credit losses related to loans for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 were 8.1 million and 18.0 million, respectively. Similarly, the decline in commercial real estate values has led to an increase in our foreclosure rates. At September 30, 2024, 23.9 of the loans in our portfolio were in foreclosure proceedings compared to 18.0 at December 31, 2023. We expect these trends to continue through the remainder of 2024. Unfunded commitments. Most of our loans are funded in full at closing. However, where all or a portion of the loan proceeds are to be used to fund the costs of renovating or constructing improvements on the property, only a portion of the loan may be funded at closing. At September 30, 2024, our mortgage loan portfolio included 80 loans with future funding obligations, in the aggregate principal amount of 71.9 million, compared 123 loans with future funding obligations, in the aggregate principal amount of 99.8 million at September 30, 2023. Advances under construction loans are funded against requests supported by all required documentation (including lien waivers) as and when needed to pay contractors and other costs of construction. To deal with these obligations, we are compelled to maintain higher cash balances, which could adversely impact our financial performance. Despite these challenges, the changing dynamics of the real estate finance marketplace, the debt and equity markets, shocks to the financial system and challenging political developments, we continue to believe in the viability of our business model. We believe that there continues to be a significant market opportunity for a well-capitalized hard money lender to originate attractively priced loans to small- and mid-scale real estate developers with good collateral, particularly in markets where, traditionally, real estate values are stable and substandard properties are improved, rehabilitated, and renovated as well as under-developed markets that are experiencing rapid growth due to population shifts. We also believe developers will prefer to borrow from us rather than other lending sources because of flexibility in structuring loans to suit their needs, our lending criteria, which places greater emphasis on the value of the collateral rather than the property cash flow or credit of the borrower, and our ability to close and service loans quickly. Our goal is, and has always been, to continue to grow our mortgage loan portfolio and increase our loan profitability, while at the same time maintaining or improving our existing underwriting and loan criteria. Specifically, we believe that the following factors will impact our performance in 2024. Strong balance sheet. At September 30, 2024, we had 220.6 million of shareholders equity and total indebtedness for borrowed money of 324.7 million (including deferred financing costs). Thus, our capital structure was 58.5 debt and 41.5 equity compared to 61.0 debt and 39.0 equity at September 30, 2023 which is significantly lower than our mortgage REIT peers. Our equity includes 2,279,824 shares of Series A Preferred Stock (as defined in Note 18), which carries a dividend rate of 7.75 per annum. Pricing power. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, the stated yield on our mortgage loan portfolio, inclusive of default interest, was 13.1 and 12.2 , respectively. (For this purpose, the yield only takes into account the stated interest rate on the mortgage note adjusted to the default rate, if applicable.) The pullback from the banking sector continues to provide demand for products and as such we have the ability to maintain attractive pricing. Access to capital . As a public company subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, we are able to access the public markets for capital. Since the IPO through September 30, 2024, we raised 513.4 million of gross proceeds through public offerings of our equity and debt securities. We have used the net proceeds from these offerings to grow our business. Liquidity . In addition, to our capital raises through the public markets, we have other sources of liquidity: (i) a 200 million master repurchase financing facility (the Churchill Facility with Churchill MRA Funding I LLC Churchill ), a subsidiary of Churchill Real Estate, a vertically integrated real estate finance company based in New York, New York and (ii) a 65 million revolving credit facility with Needham Bank, a Massachusetts co-operative bank, which can be increased up to 75 million (the Needham Credit Facility ). As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 5.9 million. Management . Our senior executive officers include John Villano, president and chief executive officer, and Nicholas Marcello, chief financial officer. Other key personnel include a senior vice president asset management and a vice 

 35 

Table of Contents 
 president asset management. In addition, we have added personnel in operations, accounting and administration to accommodate the growth of our business. Although these new hires have resulted in increased compensation, they were and will continue to be necessary to accommodate our growth and to maintain our ability to continue to service our borrowers and manage our business without sacrificing quality. 
 Financing Strategy Overview To continue to grow our business, we must increase the size of our loan portfolio, which requires that we use our existing working capital to fund new loans and raise additional capital either by selling shares of our capital stock or by incurring additional indebtedness. We do not have a policy limiting the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. Thus, our operating income in the future will depend on how much debt we incur and the spread between our cost of funds and the yield on our loan portfolio. Rising interest rates have an adverse impact on our business unless we can increase the rates on our loans to offset the increase in our cost of funds and to satisfy investor demand for yield. In addition, rapidly rising interest rates could have an unsettling effect on real estate values, which could compromise some of our collateral. We do not have any formal policy limiting the amount of indebtedness we may incur, but we are limited to a 150 asset coverage ratio from our debt covenants. Depending on various factors we may, in the future, decide to take on additional debt to expand our mortgage loan origination activities to increase the potential returns to our shareholders. Although we have no pre-set guidelines in terms of leverage ratio, the amount of leverage we will deploy will depend on our assessment of a variety of factors, which may include the liquidity of the real estate market in which most of our collateral is located, employment rates, general economic conditions, the cost of funds relative to the yield curve, the potential for losses and extension risk in our portfolio, the gap between the duration of our assets and liabilities, our opinion regarding the creditworthiness of our borrowers, the value of the collateral underlying our portfolio, and our outlook for interest rates and property values. At September 30, 2024, debt represented 58.5 of our total capital compared to 61.0 at September 30, 2023. To prudently grow the business and satisfy the tax requirement to distribute 90 of our taxable income, we expect to maintain our current level of debt and look to reduce our cost of capital. We intend to maintain a modest amount of leverage for the sole purpose of financing our portfolio and not for speculating on changes in interest rates. Loan Sale In October 2024 we retained Mission Capital Mission ), a subsidiary of Marcus and Millichap, which is a real estate capital markets firm, as our sole and exclusive advisor for the proposed sale of a pool of mortgage loans with an aggregate principal value of approximately 78.8 million. A majority of these loans are classified as non-accrual, meaning payments of interest owed are more than 90 days overdue. In the current market environment, selling these non-performing loans offers a strategic opportunity to improve liquidity and mitigate the opportunity cost associated with holding underperforming assets. Non-performing loans not only tie up valuable capital but also increase our cost of capital by raising risk perceptions among lenders and investors, making it more expensive for us to access financing. Current bids project recoverability of approximately 70 of unpaid principal balance indicating a loss on these loans of approximately 26.9 million which is inclusive of loss on unpaid principal balance, along with unpaid interest, fees, and charges. We are anticipating closing the transaction prior to December 31, 2024. The net proceeds from the sale will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, with a portion potentially allocated to repaying the December 2024 Notes. By reducing our exposure to non-performing loans, this transaction will allow us to optimize capital allocation, lower our cost of capital, and position the Company for stronger financial flexibility moving forward. Debt Our total outstanding indebtedness at September 30, 2024 was 324.7 million, which included 23.5 million outstanding under the Churchill Facility, 1.0 million outstanding under the New NHB Mortgage, 35.5 million outstanding under the Needham Credit Facility and 264.7 million aggregate outstanding principal amount of five-year, unsecured unsubordinated notes, (the Notes as set forth below. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company redeemed its 7.125 unsecured, unsubordinated 

 36 

Table of Contents 
 Notes due June 30, 2024 in the aggregate principal amount of 23.7 million plus the accrued interest thereon. At September 30, 2024, the Company has six series of Notes outstanding: 40.3 million aggregate original principal amount, issued August 23, 2022, bearing interest at the rate of 8.00 per annum and maturing on September 30, 2027 (the September 2027 Notes ), which trades on the NYSE American under the symbol SCCG; 30.0 million aggregate original principal amount, issued May 11, 2022, bearing interest at the rate of 7.125 per annum and maturing on June 30, 2027 (the June 2027 Notes ), which trades on the NYSE American under the symbol SCCF; 51.9 million aggregate original principal amount, issued March 9, 2022, bearing interest at the rate of 6.00 per annum and maturing on March 30, 2027 (the March 2027 Notes ), which trades on the NYSE American under the symbol SCCE; 51.8 million aggregate original principal amount, issued December 20, 2021, bearing interest at the rate of 6.00 per annum and maturing on December 30, 2026 (the 2026 Notes ), which trades on the NYSE American under the symbol SCCD; 56.4 million aggregate original principal amount, of which 14.4 million was issued September 4, 2020, 14.0 million was issued October 23, 2020 and 28.0 million was issued December 22, 2020, bearing interest at the rate of 7.75 per annum and maturing on September 30, 2025 (the 2025 Notes ), which trades on the NYSE American under the symbol SCCC. The 2025 Notes are prepayable beginning on September 4, 2022; and 34.5 million aggregate original principal amount, issued November 7, 2019, bearing interest at the rate of 6.875 per annum and maturing on December 30, 2024 (the December 2024 Notes ), which trades on the NYSE American under the symbol SACC. 
 Each series of Notes was issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated June 21, 2019, and a supplement thereto, which provides for the form and terms, including default provisions and cures, applicable to each series. All seven series of Notes are subject to (i) Defeasance, which means that, by depositing with a trustee an amount of cash and/or government securities sufficient to pay all principal and interest, if any, on such notes when due and satisfying any additional conditions required under the Indenture, we will be deemed to have been discharged from our obligations under such notes and (ii) an Asset Coverage Ratio requirement pursuant to which we may not (x) pay any dividends or make distributions in excess of 90 of our taxable income, (y) incur any indebtedness or (z) purchase any shares of our capital stock unless we have an Asset Coverage Ratio of at least 150 after giving effect to the payment of such dividend, the making of such distribution or the incurrence of such indebtedness. Asset Coverage Ratio means the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the value of our total assets relative to the aggregate amount of its indebtedness. Under the terms of the Indenture, we may, at our option, at any time and from time to time, redeem Notes two years after the date of their original issuance. The Notes are all currently redeemable at our option. In each case the redemption price is equal to 100 of the outstanding principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption. On and after any redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the redeemed notes. Our secured indebtedness as of September 30, 2024 includes the Churchill Facility, the New NHB Mortgage and the Needham Credit Facility (each as described below). Under the terms of the Churchill Facility, we have the right, but not the obligation, to sell mortgage loans to Churchill, and Churchill has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase those loans. In addition, we have the right and, in some instances the obligation, to repurchase those loans from Churchill. The amount that Churchill will pay for each mortgage loan it purchases will vary based on the attributes of the loan and various other circumstances but generally will not exceed 70 of the unpaid principal balance purchased. The repurchase price is calculated by applying an interest factor, as defined, to the purchase price of the mortgage loan. We also granted Churchill a first priority security interest on the mortgage loans sold to Churchill to secure our repurchase obligation. The cost of capital under the Churchill Facility is equal to the sum of (a) the greater of (i) 0.25 and (ii) the 90-day SOFR plus (b) 3 - 4 , depending on the aggregate principal amount of the mortgage loans held by Churchill at that time. Our obligations under the Churchill Facility are secured by a lien on the mortgage loans sold to Churchill. The Churchill Facility is also subject to various terms and conditions, including representations and warranties, covenants and agreements typically found in these types of financing 

 37 

Table of Contents 
 arrangements, including a covenant that (A) prohibits us from (i) paying any dividend or make any distribution in excess of 90 of our taxable income, (ii) incurring any indebtedness or (iii) purchasing any shares of our capital stock, unless, in any case, we have an asset coverage ratio of at least 150 ; and (B) requires us to maintain unencumbered cash and cash equivalents in an amount equal to or greater than 2.50 of the amount of our repurchase obligations. Churchill has the right to terminate the Churchill Facility at any time upon 180 days prior notice to us. At such time, we have an additional 180 days after termination to repurchase all the mortgage loans held by Churchill. We believe the Churchill Facility gives us the ability to raise capital as needed at a relatively low rate. It also gives us the flexibility to seek other sources of funding. At September 30, 2024, the amount outstanding under the Churchill Facility was 23.5 million, which amount was accruing interest of an effective rate of 8.95 per annum. On February 28, 2023, we refinanced the 1.4 million adjustable-rate mortgage loan from New Haven Bank which we originally obtained in 2021, with a new 1.66 million adjustable-rate mortgage loan from New Haven Bank (the New NHB Mortgage ). The new loan accrues interest at an initial rate of 5.75 per annum for the first 60 months. The interest rate will be adjusted on each of March 1, 2028 and March 1, 2033 to the then published 5-year Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston Classic Advance Rate, plus 1.75 . From April 1, 2023 through March 1, 2038, principal and interest is due and payable on a monthly basis. All payments under the new loan are amortized based on a 20-year amortization schedule. The unpaid principal amount of the loan and all accrued and unpaid interest are due and payable in full on March 1, 2038. The new loan is a non-recourse obligation, secured primarily by a first mortgage lien on the property located at 568 East Main Street, Branford, Connecticut. On March 2, 2023, we entered into a Credit and Security Agreement (the Credit Agreement ), with Needham Bank, a Massachusetts co-operative bank, as the administrative agent Needham for the lenders party thereto (the Lenders with respect to a 45 million revolving credit facility (the Needham Credit Facility ). Under the Credit Agreement, we have the right to request an increase in the size of the Needham Credit Facility up to 75 million, subject to certain conditions, including the approval of the Lenders. As of September 8, 2023, the Needham Credit Facility was increased to 65 million. Loans under the Needham Credit Facility accrue interest at the greater of (i) the annual rate of interest equal to the prime rate, as published in the Money Rates column of The Wall Street Journal minus one-quarter of one percent (0.25 ), and (ii) four and one-half percent (4.50 ). All amounts borrowed under the Needham Credit Facility are secured by a first priority lien on virtually all our assets. Assets excluded from the lien include real estate owned by us (other than real estate acquired pursuant to foreclosure), and mortgages sold under the Churchill Facility. The Needham Credit Facility expires March 2, 2026 subject to our right to extend the term for one year upon the consent of the Needham and the Lenders, which consent cannot be unreasonably withheld, and so long as we are not in default and satisfy certain other conditions. All outstanding revolving loans and accrued but unpaid interest is due and payable on the expiration date. We have the right to terminate the Needham Credit Facility at any time without premium or penalty by delivering written notice to Needham at least ten (10) days prior to the proposed date of termination. The Needham Credit Facility is subject to other terms and conditions, including representations and warranties, covenants and agreements typically found in these types of financing arrangements, including a covenant that requires us to maintain: (A) a ratio of Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to Debt Service (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of less than 1.40 to 1.0, tested on a trailing-twelve-month basis at the end of each fiscal quarter, commencing with the quarter ended June 30, 2023; (B) a sum of cash, cash equivalents and availability under the facility equal to or greater than 10 million; and (C) an asset coverage ratio of at least 150 . At September 30, 2024, the amount outstanding under the Needham Credit Facility was 35.5 million, which was accruing interest of an effective rate of 7.75 per annum. Currently, we are not in compliance with the debt service coverage ratio covenant in the Credit Agreement relating to the Needham Credit Facility described in the previous paragraph. Our inability to comply with this covenant is directly related to the provision for credit losses, which, as discussed elsewhere in this Report, is a non-cash charge that adversely impacts our earnings. Unlike other non-cash charges against earnings, such as depreciation and amortization, provision for credit losses related to mortgage loans is not added back to earnings under the definition of EBITDA. Needham is aware of the situation and has informed us that they are considering granting us a waiver on the debt service covenant ratio. Per the Credit Agreement, the breach of a covenant can result in a default which, if left uncured for more than 30 days, allows Needham to terminate the facility. Finally, from time-to-time we raise capital by selling our common shares and shares of our Series A Preferred Stock through our at-the market offering facility. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, under our at-the-market offering facility, we sold an aggregate of 568,711 common shares, realizing gross proceeds of 2.1 million and 256,703 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock having an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately 6.4 million, realizing gross proceeds of 5.4 million (representing a discount of 15.7 from the liquidation preference.) At September 30, 2024, 48.3 million of common shares and shares of our Series A Preferred Stock having a liquidation preference of approximately 66.8 million were available for future sale under the ongoing at-the-market offering.

 REIT Qualification We believe that we have qualified as a REIT since the consummation of the IPO and that it is in the best interests of our shareholders that we operate as a REIT. We made the election to be taxed as a REIT beginning with our 2017 tax year. As a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90 of our taxable income to our shareholders on an annual basis. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain REIT status. Our qualification as a REIT depends on our ability to meet on a continuing basis, through actual investment and operating results, various complex requirements under the Code, relating to, among other things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets, our compliance with the distribution requirements applicable to REITs and the diversity of ownership of our outstanding common shares. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our qualification as a REIT. So long as we qualify as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income that we distribute currently to our shareholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate income tax rates and may be precluded from electing to be treated as a REIT for four taxable years following the year during which we lose our REIT qualification. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income. Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management will base the use of estimates on (a) various assumptions that consider prior reporting results, (b) projections regarding future operations and (c) general financial market and local and general economic conditions. Actual amounts could differ from those estimates. Interest income from commercial loans is recognized, as earned, over the loan period, whereas origination and modification fee revenue on commercial loans are amortized over the term of the respective notes. We record allowances for credit losses in accordance with ASU No. 2016-13, known as CECL (i.e., current expected credit losses) on our loan portfolio, including unfunded construction commitments, on a collective basis by assets with similar risk characteristics. This methodology replaces the probable incurred loss impairment methodology. In addition, interest and fees receivable and amounts included in due from borrowers, other than reimbursements, which include origination, modification and other fees receivable are also analyzed for credit losses in accordance with the CECL standard, as they represent a financial asset that is subject to credit risk. Further, CECL made changes to the accounting for available-for-sale debt securities. One such change is to require credit losses to be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down on available-for-sale debt securities if management does not intend to sell and does not believe that it is more likely than not, they will be required to sell. Also, as allowed under the CECL standard that we have adopted, as a practical expedient, the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date is compared to the net carrying amount of the loan when determining the allowance for credit losses for loans in pending/pre-foreclosure status, as defined. Fair value of collateral is reduced by estimated cost to sell if the collateral is expected to be sold. The CECL standard requires an entity to consider historical loss experience, current conditions, and a reasonable and supportable forecast of the economic environment. We utilize a loss-rate method for estimating current expected credit losses. The loss rate method involves applying a loss rate to a pool of loans with similar risk characteristics to estimate the expected credit losses on that pool of loans. In determining the CECL allowance, we consider various factors including (1) historical loss experience in its portfolio, (2) loan specific losses for loans deemed collateral dependent based on excess amortized cost over the fair value of the underlying collateral, and (3) our current and future view of the macroeconomic environment. We also utilize a reasonable and supportable forecast period equal to the contractual term of the loan plus any applicable short-term extensions that are reasonably expected for construction loans. The allowance for the mortgages receivable is presented in the consolidated balance sheets while the allowances on the interest receivable, due from borrowers, and (available-for-sale debt) investment securities are presented net of the allowance. The accrued allowance for unfunded construction commitments is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets included in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements. The change in the balances during the reporting period are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations under the provision for credit losses related to loans.

 Results of Operations Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023 Total revenue Total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 14.8 million compared to 17.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 3.0 million, or 16.8 . The decrease in revenue is primarily attributable to a decrease in our lending operations in comparison to the same 2023 period, which have been adversely impacted by current conditions in the capital markets, making it extremely difficult for us to raise the capital on terms that we deem to be acceptable. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, interest income was 11.4 million compared to 14.3 million for the same 2023 period, a decrease of 2.9 million or 20.0 . The decrease is in-line with the decline of our mortgage loan portfolio, as well as comes as a direct result of the increase of loans in nonaccrual. Fee income from loans decreased to 1.8 million compared to 2.4 million for the same 2023 period, a decrease of 0.6 million, or 23.9 . This decrease in fees was primarily attributable to a decrease in originations. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we funded 12 new loans having an aggregate original principal amount of 6.7 million, compared to 18 loans in the amount of 28.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. As a result, origination fee income decreased approximately 16.4 , from 0.6 million for the three months September 30, 2023 to 0.1 million for the three months September 30, 2024. Loan originations, modifications, and extensions for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 14.4 million compared to 52.2 million for the same 2023 period. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we were predominantly focused on modifying existing loans. Income from partnership investments was 1.5 million for the 2024 period compared to 0.8 million for the 2023 period, an increase of 0.8 million or 91.2 . In addition, other investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.03 million compared to 0.3 million for the same 2023 period, a decrease of 0.3 million or 98.9 . Other income remained relatively stagnant period over period. Operating expenses Total operating expenses for three months ended September 30, 2024 were 19.6 million compared to 11.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 8.3 million or 72.8 . The increase in operating expenses is primarily attributable to our provision for credit losses related to loans. For the 2024 period, provision for credit losses related to loans were 8.1 million compared to a 0.1 million recovery of credit losses related to loans for the comparable 2023 period. This increase is primarily due to a period-over-period increase of loans in pending and pre-foreclosure status of 13.5 million, as a result of 81.8 million of unpaid principal, interest, and charges as of September 30, 2024 compared to 68.3 million as of September 30, 2023. Such balances consist of primarily commercial assets, of which have experienced a decline in fair value throughout 2024. See Note 2 to the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for further details on our methodology on determining allowance for credit losses and provisions for credit losses related to loans under such category. The remaining fluctuations in operating expenses were primarily attributable to (i) general and administrative expenses increased 1.0 million as a result of additional legal and advisory fees incurred in dealing with an activist shareholder, (ii) interest and amortization of deferred financing costs decreased 0.8 million as result of repayment of the June 2024 note, (iii) impairment loss on real estate owned increased 0.1 million, (iv) a 0.2 million decrease in net loss on sale of real estate owned, and property and equipment and (v) other expenses which increased 0.09 million. Other income (loss) For both of the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we reported a 0.2 million loss on equity securities. Net income (loss) Net loss attributable to common shareholders for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 6.1 million, or 0.13 per share, compared to net income to common shareholders 5.2 million, or 0.12 per share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023 Total revenue Total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 46.7 million compared to 48.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 1.6 million, or 3.3 . The decrease in revenue is primarily attributable to the decline in our mortgage loan portfolio, which decreased 4.4 period-to-period. For the 2024 period, interest income was 35.8 million compared to 37.2 million for the same 2023 period, representing a decrease of 1.4 million, a 3.6 decrease. The decrease is in-line with the decline of our mortgage loan portfolio, as well as comes as a direct result of increases of loans in nonaccrual. Fee income from loans decreased to 6.5 million compared to 7.9 million for the same 2023 period, a decrease of 1.4 million, or 17.3 . This decrease in fees was primarily attributable to a decrease in originations. For the first nine months of 2024, we funded 38 new loans having an aggregate original principal amount of 60.2 million, compared to 56 loans in the amount of 100.1 million for the first nine months of 2023. Similarly, origination fee income decreased approximately 13.6 , from 2.2 million for the nine months of 2023 to 1.9 million for the first nine months of 2024. Also, other investment income was 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.9 million for the same 2023 period, a decrease of 0.5 million or 55.4 . These decreases were offset, in part, by increases in partnership investment income and other income. Income from partnership investments was 3.9 million for the 2024 period compared to 2.3 million for the 2023 period, an increase of 1.6 million or 67.1 . Operating expenses Total operating costs and expenses for nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 50.4 million compared to 31.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 18.7 million, or 59.0 . The increase in operating expenses is primarily attributable to our provision for credit losses related to loans. For the 2024 period, provision for credit losses related to loans were 18.0 million compared to 0.07 million for the same 2023 period, an increase of 17.9 million. The increase in provision for credit losses related to loans relates to the aforementioned increase in loans in pending and pre-foreclosure as well as the decline in fair value of such assets, along with the expectation of future decreases in such fair values. Further, general and administrative expenses increased 1.3 million, or 35.5 as a result of factors mentioned above, and other expenses increased 0.6 million or 90.1 . Such increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest and amortization of deferred financing costs. For the 2024 period, interest and amortization of deferred financing costs was 21.3 million compared to 21.7 million for the same 2023 period, a decrease of 0.4 million, or 1.9 . Other income (loss) For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, we reported 0.2 million gain on equity securities compared to a 0.4 million gain on equity securities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net Income (loss) Net loss attributable to common shareholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 6.7 million, or 0.14 per share, compared to net income of 14.2 million, or 0.32 per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 0.46 per share swing is due primarily to the increase in provisions for credit losses related to loans, as stated above. Liquidity and Capital Resources Total assets at September 30, 2024 were 555.5 million compared to 625.5 million at December 31, 2023, a decrease of 70.0 million, or 11.2 . The decrease was due primarily to the decrease of our cash and cash equivalents of 6.7 million, a decrease in investments securities of 36.2 million, a decrease in net mortgages receivable of 34.8 million, and a decrease in interest and fee receivable of 3.5 million, offset by increases in investment in rental real estate of 2.4 million and investment in partnership of 11.1 million. Total liabilities at September 30, 2024 were 334.9 million compared to 395.5 million at December 31, 2023, a decrease of 60.6 million, or 15.3 . This decrease is primarily due to principal repayments of; notes payable of 21.9 million, repurchase facility of 3.0 million, and the line of credit of 26.3 million. Additionally, decreases in the accrued dividends payable of 5.1 million, deferred revenue of 1.3 million, and advances from borrowers of 3.9 million, offset by increases accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 1.0 million.

 Total shareholders equity at September 30, 2024 was 220.6 million compared to 230.1 million at December 31, 2023, a decrease of 9.5 million. This decrease was due primarily to dividends paid on common shares and Series A Preferred Stock of 9.0 million and 3.2 million, respectively, along with net loss of 3.4 million and repurchases of our common shares of 1.4 million, which was partially offset by the proceeds of the sale of Series A Preferred Stock of 5.2 million, issuance of common shares of 2.1 million, and stock-based compensation of 0.7 million. Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 13.5 million compared to 18.9 million for the comparable 2023 period.

Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 44.3 million compared to net cash used for investing activities of 67.6 million for the comparable 2023 period. For the 2024 period, net cash provided by investing activities consisted primarily of proceeds from the sale of investment securities of 44.0 million, proceeds from sales of real estate owned of 2.0 million, and principal collections on mortgages receivable of 135.3 million, offset by purchases of investment securities of 7.8 million, purchases of interests in investment partnerships, net of 11.1 million, improvements in investment in rental real estate of 2.5 million, and principal disbursements for mortgages receivable of 115.7 million. For the 2023 period, net cash used for investing activities consisted primarily of purchases of investment securities of approximately 21.1 million, net purchases of interests in investment partnerships of approximately 9.1 million, investment in rental real estate of approximately 10.7 million and principal disbursements for mortgage loans of approximately 159.7 million, offset by principal collections on mortgage loans of approximately 123.5 million, proceeds from sale of real estate owned of approximately 0.1 million, proceeds from sale of property and equipment of approximately 0.5 million, and by proceeds from the sale of investment securities of approximately 9.1 million. Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was (64.5) million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 50.7 million for the comparable 2023 period. Net cash used in financing activities for the 2024 period consists principally of repayment of lines of credit of 26.3 million, repayment of repurchase facility of 3.0 million, dividends paid on common shares and Series A Preferred Stock of 14.2 million and 3.2 million, respectively, and repayment of the unsecured notes payable that came due in September 2024 of 23.6 million, offset by proceeds from the issuance of common shares, net of expenses and Series A Preferred Stock, net of expenses of 2.1 million and 5.2 million, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities for the 2023 period consists principally of net proceeds from the issuance of common shares of approximately 15.3 million, net proceeds from the issuance of Series A Preferred Stock of approximately 1.9 million, net proceeds from line of credit of approximately 47.8 million, net proceeds from repurchase facility of approximately 5.4 million, and proceeds from mortgage of 0.4 million, offset primarily by dividends paid on common shares of approximately 16.9 million and Series A Preferred Stock of approximately 2.8 million. Our long-term cash needs will include principal payments on outstanding indebtedness and funding of new mortgage loans. We project anticipated cash requirements for our operating needs as well as cash flows generated from operating activities available to meet these needs. Our short-term cash requirements primarily include funding of loans and construction draws and payments for usual and customary operating and administrative expenses, such as interest payments on notes payable, employee compensation, sales, marketing expenses and dividends. Additionally, the December 2024 Notes are due and payable on December 30, 2024. We intend to repay the December 2024 Notes with a combination of cash flow from operations, proceeds from our existing credit facilities (i.e., Churchill and Needham), and proceeds from the sale of loans (as described in Note 19 Subsequent Events). Accordingly, we believe that our current cash balances, and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund the operations for the next 12 months.

Exhibit 10.14 SACHEM CAPITAL CORP. 568 East Main Street Branford, CT 06405 FORM OF RESTRICTED STOCK GRANT AGREEMENT September 7, 2023 [NAME AND ADDRESS] Dear : Sachem Capital Corp., a New York corporation (the Company ), hereby awards to you under its 2016 Equity Compensation Plan (the Plan 6,000 common shares (the Restricted Shares ), 0.001 par value per share, of the Company (the Common Shares pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The Company represents that the Restricted Shares are fully paid and non-assessable. The Restricted Shares are subject to the vesting provisions set forth herein and certain other restrictions as provided for herein. Capitalized terms used herein and not defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in the Plan. You are entitled to all the rights and privileges of a holder of the Shares (including the right to receive and retain all dividends declared thereon). As used herein, the term Restricted Shares shall mean and include, in addition to the above referenced number of Restricted Shares, (i) any Common Shares issued and distributed as a dividend on the restricted Shares and (ii) any other securities of the Company, including shares of its capital stock, debt securities or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for equity securities of the Company, issued in connection with any merger or reorganization or recapitalization of the Company, or the reclassification of the Common Shares. By accepting the Restricted Shares, you agree as follows: 1. The vesting of the Restricted Shares shall be as follows: (i) 1,500 Restricted Shares shall vest immediately on the date hereof; (ii) 1,500 Restricted Shares shall vest on September 7, 2024; (iii) 1,500 Restricted Shares shall vest on September 7, 2025; and (iv) 1,500 Restricted Shares shall vest on September 7, 2026. Each of the foregoing dates is referred to herein as a Vesting Date . 2. No Restricted Shares may be sold, conveyed, transferred, pledged, encumbered or otherwise disposed of (any such disposition being herein called a Transfer prior to the date on which such Restricted Shares shall have vested as provided in Section 1 above, except that this Transfer restriction shall lapse, and full vesting shall be accelerated with respect to all non-vested Restricted Shares that have not been previously transferred to the Company upon: (i) your death; (ii) your being unable to carry out your duties and responsibilities as a member of the Board for an indefinite period as a direct result of any physical incapacity or mental illness as attested to by an independent licensed physician acceptable to the Company; (iii) your resignation as a member of the Company s Board of Directors (the Board in connection with a Change in Control, provided that such resignation is condition of the consummation of the transaction constituting a Change in Control; or (iv) your removal as a member of the Board within one hundred eighty (180) days of a Change in Control. 

3. If at any time following the date hereof you cease to be a member of the Board for reasons other than those specifically set forth in Section 2 above, then the balance of the unvested Restricted Shares shall be immediately forfeited to the Company (an Event of Forfeiture ). Immediately upon an Event of Forfeiture, such Restricted Shares shall be deemed to have been transferred to the Company and you shall have no further rights or privileges as a holder of the Restricted Shares so transferred. 4. You acknowledge and agree that the book-entry evidencing your ownership of the Restricted Shares shall bear the following legend(s): THESE SHARES MAY NOT BE SOLD, TRANSFERRED, HYPOTHECATED OR ASSIGNED EXCEPT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF RULE 144 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED. THE TRANSFERABILITY OF THESE SHARES ARE SUBJECT TO THE RESTRICTIONS, TERMS AND CONDITIONS (INCLUDING FORFEITURE PROVISIONS AND RESTRICTIONS AGAINST TRANSFER) CONTAINED IN THE ISSUER S 2016 EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN AND AN AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO BETWEEN THE REGISTERED OWNER OF THESE SHARES AND THE ISSUER. A COPY OF THE SUCH PLAN AND AGREEMENT IS ON FILE WITH THE SECRETARY OF THE ISSUER. 5. You will be required to satisfy any potential federal, state, local or other tax withholding liability with respect to the issuance and/or vesting of the Restricted Shares, depending upon whether you have made a proper and timely election under Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code (referred to herein as the Section 83(b) Election . Unless you have previously made a proper and timely Section 83(b) Election, such liability must be satisfied at the time the Restricted Shares become substantially vested (as defined in the regulations issued under Section 83 of the Internal Revenue Code), which would likely be when the restrictions on the Restricted Shares lapse. At such time, you will be required to report the total value of the Restricted Shares as of the date the Restricted Shares become substantially vested as ordinary income. This could result in a significant income tax burden to you if the market value of the Restricted Shares increases from the date of this Agreement through such time as the Restricted Shares become substantially vested. If you make the Section 83(b) Election, the value of the Restricted Shares will be treated as ordinary income on the date of grant and the tax withholding liability must be satisfied at that time. Any gain or loss from the sale or forfeiture of the Restricted Shares for which the Section 83(b) Election has been made will be capital gain or loss. The holding period for determining whether the gain or loss is long-term of short-term will be measured from the date hereof. Please note, that the market value of the Restricted Shares that vest on the date hereof will be included in your taxable income for 2018 regardless of whether you make the Section 83(b) Election. THE FOREGOING IS NOT INTENDED TO CONSTITUTE TAX ADVICE NOR IS IT NECESSARILY COMPREHENSIVE IN LIGHT OF YOUR PERSONAL TAX SITUATION. ACCORDINGLY, YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISOR GENERALLY WITH RESPECT TO THE TAX IMPLICATIONS OF THIS AWARD. Unless we approve other arrangements, you must deliver to us either a check or money order in the amount of the required withholding amount on each Vesting Date upon notice from the Company. If, within ten (10) days following such notice of the Vesting Date, you fail to deliver the amount of the required withholding to the Company, the Company shall have the right to take any and all action it deems reasonable or appropriate to collect the required withholding amount, including, but not limited to, offsetting such amount against any cash compensation, fees or expense reimbursement due from the Company to you and/or selling all or a portion of the Restricted Shares on your behalf. 
 2 

6. To facilitate compliance with the transactions described herein, until the Restricted Shares are fully vested pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company will hold a stock power for the Restricted Shares in the form annexed hereto, duly endorsed by you, in blank, and notarized (the Stock Power ). A form of the Stock Power is attached as Exhibit A hereto. Simultaneously with the delivery of this Agreement you shall deliver a fully completed Stock Power to the Company, which will be returned to you within a reasonable amount of time after full vesting of the Restricted Shares. 7. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of you and the Company and your and its respective successors and legal representatives. 8. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall confer upon you the right to continue to serve as a member of the Board. Very truly yours, Sachem Capital Corp. By: John L. Villano, Chief Executive Officer 
 Acceptance: I hereby accept the Restricted Shares and agree to all the terms and conditions set forth herein.
