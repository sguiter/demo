SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This quarterly report and other documents that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management s assumptions. Statements that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements, including forward-looking information concerning sales trends, gross margins, number and location of new store openings, outcomes of litigation, the level of capital expenditures, industry trends, demographic trends, growth strategies, financial results, cost reduction initiatives, acquisition synergies, regulatory approvals, and competitive strengths. Words such as expect, outlook, forecast, would, could, should, project, intend, plan, continue, sustain, on track, believe, seek, estimate, anticipate, may, assume, and variations of such words and similar expressions are often used to identify such forward-looking statements, which are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, assumptions and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on April 11, 2024 2023 Form 10-K ), this quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and our other reports that we file or furnish with the SEC. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those indicated or anticipated by such forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. Except to the extent required by law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise.

 The Company s shareholders approved the Merger at the Company s annual meeting held on September 13, 2024.

of Progressive Care s voting stock. At the time of exercise, all of the above common stock purchase warrants were in-the-money. Also on July 1, 2023, the Company and Messrs. Fernandez and Barreto entered into a voting agreement whereby at any annual or special shareholders meeting of Progressive Care s stockholders, and whenever the holders of Progressive Care common stock act by written consent, Messrs. Fernandez and Barreto agreed to vote all of the Progressive Care common stock (including any new shares acquired after the date of the voting agreement or acquired through the conversion of securities convertible into Common Stock) that they own, directly or indirectly, in the same manner that NextPlat votes its common stock and equivalents. The voting agreement is irrevocable and perpetual in term. 
 
 The exercise of the stock options, along with the entry into the voting agreement, resulted in a change in control of Progressive Care under the voting interest model in Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 805, Business Combination, and was accounted for as a business acquisition. Therefore, Progressive Care became a consolidated subsidiary of the Company on July 1, 2023.

 On October 1, 2024, at 12:01 Eastern time, the Merger became effective and Progressive Care merged with and into Mergers Sub and thereby became a wholly owned subsidiary of NextPlat. In connection with the Merger, each share of Progressive Care common stock that was issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger was converted into shares of NextPlat common stock, and each warrant to purchase Progressive Care common stock that was outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger automatically converted into a warrant to purchase shares of NextPlat common stock with each such warrant having and being subject to the same terms and conditions (including vesting and exercisability terms) as were applicable to such Progressive Care warrant immediately before the effective time.

Use of Estimates 
 
 In preparing the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the statements of financial condition, and revenues and expenses for the periods then ended. Actual results may differ significantly from those estimates. Significant estimates made by management include, but are not limited to, assumptions used to calculate stock-based compensation, fair value of net assets acquired in the business combination with Progressive Care and Outfitter, common stock and options issued for services, net realizable value of accounts receivables and other receivables, the useful lives of property and equipment and intangible assets, the estimate of the fair value of the lease liability and related right of use assets, pharmacy benefit manager PBM fee estimates, and the estimates of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets.

1 -year amortization period 
 2 -year amortization period 
 
 3 Under federal tax law, previously unidentified finite lived intangible assets recognized from a business combination have
 no tax basis and therefore are
 not amortized for tax purposes. This tax position created a book/tax basis difference at
 April 1, 2024, the date of the business combination transaction. Therefore, an approximate
 million deferred tax liability was recorded at

million. An interim impairment assessment was considered necessary as a result of the sustained decline in the Healthcare Operations stock price and related market capitalization. The goodwill impairment charge is reflected in Impairment loss in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive (Loss) Income. With the assistance of a third -party valuation firm, the fair value of the Healthcare Operations reporting segment was determined using an income approach whereby the fair value was calculated utilizing discounted estimated future cash flows (level 3 nonrecurring fair value measurement). The income approach requires several assumptions including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internally-developed forecasts of revenue and profitability, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for the business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of the weighted average cost of capital, which is risk-adjusted to reflect the specific risk profile of the reporting unit. The long-term growth rate used in the impairment was and the weighted average cost of capital used in the impairment was .

Intangibles 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company performed an impairment assessment of long-lived assets as it relates to the Healthcare Operations reporting segment due to the decline in future projected revenues and cash flows. As a result, the Company completed a recoverability test and concluded that the asset groups were not fully recoverable as the undiscounted expected future cash flows did not exceed their carrying amounts. The Company, with the assistance of a third -party valuation firm, determined the fair value of the asset groups using an income approach utilizing undiscounted estimated future cash flows (level 3 nonrecurring fair value measurement). The income approach requires several assumptions including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internally-developed forecasts of revenue and profitability, and estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur. The carrying amount of certain assets in the asset group exceeded the fair value, resulting in the recognition of a non-cash impairment charge to intangible assets of approximately million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflected in Impairment loss in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive (Loss) Income).

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized overall revenue from operations of approximately 15.4 million and 15.3 million, respectively, an overall increase of approximately 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to an increase of approximately 0.9 million from e-Commerce Operations, offset by a decrease of approximately 0.8 million from Healthcare Operations. 
 
 Gross profit margins decreased from approximately 30.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 22.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in gross profit margins during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily attributable to the decrease in reimbursement rates experienced in Healthcare Operations. The gross profit margins remained consistent for e-Commerce Operations for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 
 
 Loss before other (income) expense increased by approximately 4.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of the increase in operating expenses of approximately 3.5 million and the decrease in gross profit of approximately 1.1 million See detailed discussion below. The increase in operating expenses included non-recurring expenses and losses that are not indicative of our regular operations, including impairment losses of approximately 3.7 million and approximately 1.4 million of non-recurring operating expenses associated with our merger with Progressive Care. Without those non-recurring items, loss before other (income) expense would have been approximately 2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

The Company performed a long-lived assets impairment test as it relates to the Healthcare Operations reporting segment during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and it was determined that the carrying amount of the asset group at September 30, 2024 exceeded its fair value resulting in the Company recording a non-cash impairment charge to certain long-lived assets, primarily intangible assets, of approximately 3.7 million during the period. Refer to Note 11. Goodwill and Intangible Assets to our quarterly financials for additional details on the impairment charge, valuation methodologies, inputs used in the fair value measurements, and the changes in intangible assets for the period. 
 
 Professional fees were approximately 2.1 million and 0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of approximately 1.6 million or 311.5 . The increase was mainly attributable to the settlement of litigation and associated legal fees with the e-Commerce Operations of approximately 1.0 million, legal and consulting fees as it relates to the merger of Progressive Care of approximately 0.4 million, and fees associated with the shareholders meetings held during September 2024 of approximately 0.2 million. Management does not expect these increases in professional fees to be recurring expenses in the foreseeable future and are not indicative of projected full year results. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses were approximately 0.5 million and 0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of approximately 0.4 million or 45.1 . The decrease was attributable to the decrease in intangible assets amortization related to Healthcare Operations of approximately 0.4 million.

 Equity Method Investment 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a gain on the remeasurement of fair value of equity method investment of our affiliate, Progressive Care, of approximately 6.1 million which was accounted for as an equity method investment. Effective July 1, 2023, Progressive Care became a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, which resulted in a change in the accounting treatment from equity method to consolidation. 
 
 Net (Loss) Income 
 
 We recorded net (loss) income of approximately 7.7 million) and 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change was a result of the factors described above. 
 
 Comprehensive (Loss) Income 
 
 We recorded comprehensive (loss) income for foreign currency translation adjustments of approximately 6,000) and 19,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change was primarily attributed to exchange rate variances.

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized overall revenue from operations of approximately 49.8 million and 21.1 million, respectively, an overall increase of approximately 28.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to an increase of approximately 27.3 million from the Healthcare Operations reportable segment as a result of the Progressive Care acquisition on July 1, 2023, and approximately 1.5 million as it relates to the e-Commerce Operations reportable segment. 
 
 Gross profit margins remained fairly consistent at approximately 28 for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Healthcare Operations continues to experience pressures from medication price increases despite reimbursement rates not keeping pace with those increases. 
 
 Our loss before other income increased by approximately 12.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of the increase in operating expenses of approximately 20.8 million, offset by the increase in gross profit of approximately 8.1 million. The increase in operating expenses included non-recurring expenses and losses that are not indicative of our regular operations, including impairment losses of approximately 13.7 million and approximately 3.4 million of non-recurring operating expenses associated with our merger with Progressive Care. Without those non-recurring items, loss before other income would have been approximately 3.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 8.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Salaries, wages and payroll taxes were approximately 8.3 million and 4.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of approximately 4.2 million or 105.1 . The increase was mainly attributable to the Healthcare Operations as a result of the Progressive Care acquisition as of July 1, 2023, of approximately 4.0 million, and approximately 0.2 million as it relates to the Outfitter acquisition on April 1, 2024. 
 
 The Company performed a goodwill impairment test during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and it was determined that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeded its fair value resulting in the Company recording a non-cash impairment charge of approximately 0.7 million, recorded to the Healthcare Operations reporting segment. As of September 30, 2024, there was no remaining goodwill as it relates to the Healthcare Operations reporting segment. Refer to Note 11. Goodwill and Intangible Assets for additional details on the impairment charges, valuation methodologies, and inputs used in the fair value measurements.

The Company performed a long-lived assets impairment test as it relates to the Healthcare Operations reporting segment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and it was determined that the carrying amount of the asset group exceeded its fair value resulting in the Company recording a non-cash impairment charge to certain long-lived assets, primarily intangible assets, of approximately 12.8 million in total through the end of the third quarter in 2024. Refer to Note 11. Goodwill and Intangible Assets to our quarterly financials for additional details on the impairment charges, valuation methodologies, inputs used in the fair value measurements, and the changes in intangible assets for the period. 
 
 The Company recorded approximately 0.1 million of impairment loss related to the write-down of a right-of-use asset as a result of taking the leased equipment out of service and not returning to service in the future. This was recorded to the Healthcare Operations reporting segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Professional fees were approximately 4.1 million and 1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, an increase of approximately 2.7 million or 198.4 . The increase was mainly attributable to the settlement of litigation and associated legal fees with the e-Commerce Operations of approximately 1.1 million, legal and consulting fees as it relates to the merger of Progressive Care, of approximately 1.4 million, and fees associated with the shareholders meetings held during September 2024 of approximately 0.2 million. Management does not expect these increases in professional fees to be recurring expenses in the foreseeable future and are not indicative of projected full year results. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses were approximately 2.3 million and 1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of approximately 1.1 million or 90.4 . The increase was attributable to nine months of depreciation and amortization as it relates to the Healthcare Operations reportable segment of approximately 1.1 million compared to three months of depreciation and amortization in the prior year period related to the Healthcare Operations reportable segment from the Progressive Care acquisition on July 1, 2023. 
 
 Total Other Income 
 
 Our total other income increased by approximately 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023, and was mainly due to interest received of approximately 0.2 million, a favorable change in foreign currency rates approximately 0.2 million, and gain on disposal of property and equipment of approximately 0.1 million, which was offset by the non-recurring write off of aged payables of approximately 0.3 million in the prior year period, and Progressive Care management fee of approximately 0.1 million which was eliminated in consolidation during 2024 as a result of Progressive Care acquisition on July 1, 2023. 
 
 Equity Method Investment 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a net loss in the equity of our affiliate, Progressive Care, of approximately 1.4 million, and a gain on the remeasurement of fair value of equity method investment of our affiliate, Progressive Care, of approximately 6.1 million, which was accounted for as an equity method investment. Effective July 1, 2023, Progressive Care became a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, which resulted in a change in the accounting treatment from equity method to consolidation.

Net Loss 
 
 We recorded net losses of approximately 20.1 million and 2.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change was a result of the factors described above. 
 
 Comprehensive Loss 
 
 We recorded comprehensive losses for foreign currency translation adjustments of approximately 30,000 and 16,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change was primarily attributed to exchange rate variances. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. As of September 30, 2024, we had a cash balance of approximately 20.4 million. Our working capital was approximately 26.1 million at September 30, 2024. 
 
 As of the date of this report, the Company s existing cash resources and existing borrowing availability are sufficient to support planned operations for the next 12 months. As a result, management believes that the existing financial resources are sufficient to continue operating activities for at least one year past the issuance date of the financial statements.

Cash Flow from Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash flows used by operating activities totaled approximately 5.0 million and 4.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and changed by approximately 0.7 million period over period. The unfavorable change of approximately 0.7 million was primarily attributable to the following when compared period over period: 
 
 an increase in cash received from e-Commerce Operations of approximately 1.6 million due to year-over-year sales increase; an increase in cash received from Healthcare Operations of approximately 34.0 million was mainly due to nine months results for Progressive Care included in the 2024 period versus three months results during the same period in 2023 as a result of the acquisition of as of July 1, 2023;

 an increase in cash paid for salaries and related expenses of approximately 4.2 million, and other recurring operation expenses of approximately 5.1 million, and mainly due to nine months results for Progressive Care included in the 2024 period versus three months results during the same period in 2023 as a result of the acquisition of as of July 1, 2023, and Outfitter acquisition as of April 1, 2024;

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 We do not currently have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to our stockholders. 
 
 Our Company has not entered into any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement with an entity unconsolidated with us under which we have: 

an obligation under a guaranteed contract, although we do have obligations under certain sales arrangements including purchase obligations to vendors 

a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to the unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity for such assets, 

any obligation, including a contingent obligation, under a contract that would be accounted for as a derivative instrument, or 

any obligation, including a contingent obligation, arising out of a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that is held by us and material to us where such entity provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to, or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 As a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. In accordance with Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), of the effectiveness and design of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 (b) Inherent Limitations on Controls. Management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent or detect all errors and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. 
 
 (c) Changes in internal controls over financial reporting. There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 On October 15, 2024, the Company settled its ongoing lawsuit with Mr. Thomas Seifert, the Company s former Chief Financial Officer. Under the terms of the settlement, the Company agreed to pay to Mr. Seifert 150,000 and to reimburse him for legal costs in the amount of 600,000. In exchange, the Company and Mr. Seifert each agreed to dismiss the lawsuit with prejudice and to release the other party from all claims. 
 
 On June 17, 2024, Progressive Care was notified of a potential claim that a former employee allegedly suffered a loss due to an alleged breach by Progressive Care of an employment contract with the former employee. Management believes, based on discussions with its legal counsel, that Progressive Care has meritorious defenses against the former employe s claim. Since receipt of the notice of claim, Progressive Care filed a petition for arbitration against the former employee, asserting that it was the employee who breached the employment contract. Progressive Care will prosecute its claims and will defend any counterclaims vigorously as Progressive Care believes it will prevail on the merits. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of the loss. 
 
 From time to time, the Company may become involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business. The Company is not currently involved in any pending legal proceeding or litigation, and, to the best of our knowledge, no governmental authority is contemplating any proceeding to which the Company is a party or to which any of the Company s properties is subject, which would reasonably be likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and operating results. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 Investors should carefully consider the risks in the Risk Factors in Part 1: Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 11, 2024, and our other filings with the SEC. These risks are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations. Any of these risks could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition, and results of operations. The trading price of our common stock could fluctuate due to any of these risks, and investors may lose all or part of their investment. In assessing these risks, investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
