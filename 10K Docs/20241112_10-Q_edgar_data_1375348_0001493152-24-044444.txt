plans in this regard are to raise equity financing as required. 

These

MANAGEMENT
DISCUSSION ANALYSIS 

For
the Period Ended 

September
30, 2024 

MANAGEMENT S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

This
section of the quarterly report includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future
events and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like: believe, expect, estimate, anticipate,
intend, project and similar expressions, or words which, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not place undue certainty
on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this prospectus. These forward-looking statements are subject
to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or our predictions. 

Plan
of Operation 

We
are a start-up, exploration Stage Corporation and have not yet generated or realized any revenues from our business operations. 

There
is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay
our bills. This is because we have not generated any revenues and do not anticipate generating any revenues until we begin removing and
selling minerals. There is no assurance we will ever achieve these goals. Accordingly, we must raise cash from sources other than the
sale of minerals in order to implement our project and stay in business. Our only other source for cash at this time is investments by
others. 

Our
exploration target is to find a mineralized material, specifically, an ore body containing gold. Our success depends upon finding mineralized
material. This includes a determination by our consultant that the property contains reserves. We have not yet selected a consultant.
Mineralized material is a mineralized body which has been delineated by appropriate spaced drilling or underground sampling to support
sufficient tonnage and average grade of metals to justify removal. If we don t find mineralized material or if it is not economically
feasible to remove it, we will cease operations and you will lose your investment. 

In
addition, we may not have enough money to complete the acquisition and exploration of a property. If it turns out that we have not raised
enough money to complete our acquisition we will try to raise additional funds from a second public offering, a private placement or
through loans. At the present time, we have not made any plans to raise additional money and there is no assurance that we would be able
to raise additional money in the future. If we need additional money and cannot raise it, we will have to suspend or cease operations. 

Research
 Development 

As
an exploration stage company in the mining industry we are not involved in any research and development. 

Effects
of Compliance with Environmental Laws 

As
a company in the mining industry we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations. We strive to comply with all applicable
environmental, health and safety laws and regulations are currently taking the steps indicated above. We believe that our operations
are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations on environmental matters. These laws and regulations, on federal, state and
local levels, are evolving and frequently modified and we cannot predict accurately the effect, if any, they will have on its business
in the future. In many instances, the regulations have not been finalized, or are frequently being modified. Even where regulations have
been adopted, they are subject to varying and contradicting interpretations and implementation. In some cases, compliance can only be
achieved by capital expenditure and we cannot accurately predict what capital expenditures, if any, may be required. 

10 

Limited
Operating History; Need for Additional Capital 

There
is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are an exploration stage corporation
and have not generated any revenues from operations. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business
is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources, possible delays
in the acquisition and exploration of our properties, and possible cost overruns due to price increases in services. 

To
become profitable and competitive, we need to identify a property and conduct research and explore our property before we start production
of any minerals we may find. If we do find mineralized material, we will need additional funding to move beyond the research and exploration
stage. We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory
terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing
shareholders. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

We
have completed our public offering as of March 28, 2007 and to date have raised 107,060, we will attempt to raise additional money through
a subsequent private placement, public offering or through loans. 

Currently,
we do not have sufficient funds for our intended business operation. One of our officers and directors, has agreed in financing the related
operating expenditures to maintain the Company. The foregoing agreement is oral; we have nothing in writing. While it was agreed to advance
the funds, the agreement is unenforceable as a matter of law because no consideration was given. At the present time, we have not made
any arrangements to raise additional cash. If we need additional cash and can t raise it, we will either have to suspend operations
until we do raise the cash, or cease operations entirely. Other than as described in this paragraph, we have no other financing plans. 

Since
inception, we have issued 7,070,000 shares of our common stock and received 107,060. 

In
April 2006, we issued 3,000,000 shares of common stock to a former officer and director, in consideration of 30 and we issued 3,000,000
shares of common stock to one of our officers and directors in consideration of 30 pursuant to the exemption from registration contained
in Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1993. 

We
issued 1,070,000 shares of common stock pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in section 4(2) of the Securities Act of
1933. This was accounted for as a purchase of shares of common stock. 

As
of September 30, 2024, due to related parties balance of 421,565 (June 30, 2024: 405,546) represents the combination of the following: 

393,565
(June 30, 2024: 377,546) was payable to a principal shareholder s company, for the operating expenses paid by the related party
on behalf of the Company. The loan amount is unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on demand. 

28,000
(June 30, 2024: 28,000) owed to a director of the Company, for the amount of office, travel and telephone expenses paid by the related
party on behalf of the Company. The amount is unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on demand. 

Loan
payable consists of the following: 

Loan
payable was payable to non-related parties. The loan amount is unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on demand.

ITEM
2. PROPERTIES 

Summary 

The
following is a description of the Company s mineral properties. The Company holds a 100 interest on four contiguous Federal BLM
unpatented lode mining claims in Nevada that were acquired for mineral exploration purposes, primarily in exploration for precious metals. 

The
Property 

The
four GSR lode mining claims, named GSR 1, 2, 3 and 4, were staked on Federal BLM lands on July 9, 2012 by Kee Nez Resources, LLC, a Utah
limited liability company. The BLM claim numbers for
claims GSR 1, 2, 3 and 4 are 1076314, 1076315, 1076316 and 1076317 respectively. Each of the four claims are 20.66 acres in size for
a total of 82.64 acres. 

The
Company acquired these unpatented claims on August 15, 2013, from Kee Nez Resources, LLC, who quitclaimed the four claims to the Company.
This transfer was filed and recorded with the BLM on August 23, 2013. As a result, Golden Star Resource Corp. holds a 100 interest in
the four claims. There are no underlying agreements or royalties. 

A
Maintenance Fee or a Maintenance Fee Waiver Certification must be filed annually on or before September 1st in order to keep the claims
valid and is filed in advance for the upcoming assessment year. Since the Company holds less than 10 Federal unpatented lode mining claims
it is entitled to file a Maintenance Fee Waiver Certification in lieu of paying the fee of 155 per claim. Payment of the Maintenance
Fee or filing of the Fee Waiver Certification is the responsibility of Golden Star Resource Corp. Notice of Holding of these claims is
also filed annually with Churchill County. 

All
requirements have been met until the next annual due date of September 1, 2025. 

There
are no buildings, equipment or other facilities on the claims. Sources of power and water have not been investigated to date. 

The
Company only has mineral rights by virtue of these claims. It does not hold any surface rights. 

Location 

The
GSR 1-4 unpatented lode mining claims are situated in Sections 9 and 16, T14N, R35E, MDM, in Churchill County, Nevada. 

The
property is located 98 air miles southeast of Reno, NV and 48 air miles southeast of Fallon, NV. The property can be accessed from Fallon
by heading east on US Hwy 50 for 46 miles and then heading south on NV 361 for 15 miles. This paved highway cuts across the southeast
corner of the claim group (see Fig 2).

Geology 

The
GSR property lies in the Basin and Range Province near its western margin where it adjoins the northwest-southeast trending Walker Lane
mineral belt. This boundary is about 20 miles west of the GSR property. The Basin and Range Province is a major physiographic region
of the western US, centered on Nevada and western Utah, typified by north-northeast trending mountain ranges separated by broad flat
alluvium filled valleys. Gold and silver mineralization is known to occur in many parts of this Province. 

In
the vicinity of the GSR property there are numerous historical small mine workings in the surrounding mountain ranges, an active exploration
project at Bell Mt. 8 miles to the northwest and several past producing large gold mines, such as Paradise Peak 25 miles to the southeast
and Rawhide 25 miles to the west. 

The
near-surface rocks in the area of the GSR property are a series of sub-outcropping Mesozoic Age metasedimentary rocks overlain by Tertiary
Age rhyolitic lavas and volcanoclastics. 

No
exploration has been carried out on the property by GSR and it has not been examined by a GSR contracted professional geologist or by
GSR s officers or directors. 

Due
to current subdued market conditions in the junior natural resource markets the Company has no plans for an exploration program until
it has the ability to raise sufficient funds to engage in an exploration program. Such a program would likely initially entail prospecting,
geological mapping and rock-chip sampling. Quality Assurance and Quality Controls for sampling collection protocols will be developed
with the exploration program as funding allows. There would be no permitting or bonding requirements for this preliminary phase of exploration.
Permits and bonding would be required if and when exploration advanced to a drilling or trenching phase since those activities cause
surface disturbance. 

The
property is currently without any known reserves and any program to be proposed in the future would be exploratory in nature.
