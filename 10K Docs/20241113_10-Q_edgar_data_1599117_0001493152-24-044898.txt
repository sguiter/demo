SPECIAL
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
report contains forward-looking statements, as defined in the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995 and Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act 1934, as amended. All statements contained in this report, other than statements
of historical fact, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, our business strategy and
plans, and our objectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements. The words believe, may, 
 will, estimate, continue, anticipate, seek, look, 
 hope, intend, expect, and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that
we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short-term and long-term business operations
and objectives, acquisition plans, and financial needs. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties,
and assumptions. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact on the Company s business and
results of operations of inflation, interest rate increases, tax increases, tariff increases, recession, climate regulation, economic
sanctions, cybersecurity risks, evolving and sophisticated cyber-attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information
technology systems, increased risk to oil markets, potential banking crises, future weakness in the credit markets, increased rates of
default and bankruptcy, political change, the war in Ukraine, and the Israel-Hamas war on the Company s business and results of
operations are forward-looking statements. Moreover, due to our past investments or current involvement in oil, gas, coal, or uranium-related
industry or other industries, we may be subject to heightened scrutiny, and, as a result, our portfolio companies may be subject to additional
laws, rules, regulations, and statutes. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all
factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from
those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, the future events
and trends discussed in this Form 10-Q may not occur, and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated
or implied in the forward-looking statements. 

You
should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking
statements may not be achieved or occur. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable,
we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. The Company assumes no obligation to revise or
update any forward-looking statements for any reason except as required by law.

The
entity was originally founded as an investment partnership in Silicon Valley, California, by the current CEO in 1985 and subsequently
incorporated under the laws of the State of California on . On September 12, 1996, the Company s offering statement
was qualified pursuant to Regulation A of the Securities Act, and the Company began to trade its shares publicly. On August 21, 1998,
the Company filed for voluntary reorganization, and on January 11, 2000, the Company emerged from Chapter 11 reorganization. The Company
relocated to San Diego, California, and contracted to provide financial assistance and investment in small businesses. On May 22, 2015,
a corporation named Mentor Capital, Inc. Mentor Delaware was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. A
shareholder-approved merger between Mentor and Mentor Delaware was approved by the California and Delaware Secretaries of State and became
effective September 24, 2015, thereby establishing Mentor as a Delaware corporation. In September 2020, Mentor relocated its corporate
office from San Diego, California, to Plano, Texas. 

The
Company s common stock trades publicly under the trading symbol OTCQB: MNTR. 

The
Company s current target industry focus includes the classic energy sectors of oil, gas, coal, uranium, and related ventures. Additionally,
the Company has residual investments in legal dispute resolution services, collecting on an annuity-like financing, and the collection
of a judgment that it intends to continue to pursue. 

Mentor s
 owned subsidiaries, Mentor IP, LLC MCIP ), Mentor Partner I, LLC, Partner I ), Mentor Partner II, LLC Partner II ), and TWG, LLC TWG ), are headquartered in Plano, Texas. 

MCIP
held intellectual property and licensing rights related to one United States and one Canadian patent associated with vape pens. On October
24, 2023, MCIP divested its intellectual property and licensing rights related to the United States and Canadian patents. Maintenance
fees and secretary of state fees were expensed when paid, and no capitalized assets related to MCIP are recognized on the consolidated
financial statements at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 because the divestment activity had been limited to secretary of state
and registered agent fees. 

On
August 27, 2021, the Company and Mentor Partner I entered into a Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release with the G Farma Entities and
guarantors G Farma Settlors to resolve and settle all outstanding claims on an unpaid finance lease receivable and notes
receivable of balances of and , respectively, plus accrued interest Settlement Agreement ). On October
12, 2021, the parties filed a Stipulation for Dismissal and Continued Jurisdiction with the Superior Court of California in the County
of Marin. The Court ordered that it retain jurisdiction over the parties under Section 664.6 of the California Code of Civil Procedure
to enforce the Settlement Agreement until the performance in full of its terms is met. 

In
August 2022, September 2022, and October 2022, the G Farma Settlors failed to make monthly payments and failed to cure each default within
10 days notice from the Company pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. As a result, was added to the amount payable
by the G Farma Settlors in accordance with the terms of the Settlement Agreement. The Company and Partner I sought entry of a stipulated
judgment against the G Farma Settlors for (1) , the remaining amount of the settlement amount, which has not yet been
paid by the G Farma Settlors plus and all accrued unpaid interest, (2) the Company s incurred costs, and (3) attorneys 
fees paid by the Company to obtain the judgment. 

On
July 11, 2023, the Court entered judgment against the G Farma Settlors and in favor of Mentor and Partner I in the amount of ,
which is comprised of in principal (calculated as the aggregate settlement amount, less payments made by the G Farma Settlors,
plus the default addition) plus accrued and unpaid interest of , costs of , and attorneys fees of incurred
by Mentor and Mentor Partner I in connection with obtaining the judgment. The judgment also accrues post-judgment interest at the rate
of from July 11, 2023 until such time as the judgment is paid in full. 

Note
1 - Nature of operations (continued) 

The
Company has retained the full reserve on the unpaid notes receivable balance and collections of the unpaid lease receivable balance due
to the long history of uncertain payments from G Farma and the G Farma Settlors. Payments from G Farma and G Farma Settlors will be recognized
in Other Income as they are received. Recovery payments of and were included in other income in the consolidated financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The last recovery payment was received on October 11, 2022. The
 judgment and interest receivable of for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is fully reserved pending the outcome
of the Company s collection process. See Notes 8 and 16. 

On
September 27, 2022, Pueblo West Organics, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company Pueblo West ), exercised a lease prepayment
option and purchased manufacturing equipment from Partner II for . On September 28, 2022, Partner II transferred full title to
the equipment to Pueblo West. Originally, Mentor contributed to Partner II to facilitate the purchase of manufacturing equipment
to be leased from Partner II by Pueblo West under a Master Equipment Lease Agreement dated February 11, 2018, as amended. On March 12,
2019, Mentor agreed to use Partner II earnings of to facilitate the purchase of additional manufacturing equipment to Pueblo
West under a Second Amendment to the lease. See Note 8. 

On
November 18, 2022, following the filing of a declaratory relief action, Mentor received from Electrum Partners, LLC Electrum pursuant to a certain November 14, 2022 Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release, following the Company s October 21, 2022 lawsuit
against Electrum and the escrow agent in the County of San Mateo. The Company applied to a certain October 30, 2018, Recovery
Purchase Agreement, and to an October 31, 2018 and January 28, 2019 Capital Agreement. The Company applied the remaining 
to its equity interest in Electrum; this resulted in a loss on the Company s investment in Electrum. See Note
9. 

On
November 22, 2017 and October 31, 2018, the Company purchased convertible notes in principal face value of and , respectively,
from NeuCourt, Inc. NeuCourt that each bore interest at per annum. On November 7, 2019, October 28, 2020, and January
4, 2022, the Company received , , and warrants covering an aggregate of shares of NeuCourt common stock exercisable
at per share in exchange for the Company s agreement to extend the maturity dates of the convertible notes. On July 15, 2022,
all principal and accrued interest on the notes were converted into a Simple Agreement for Future Equity SAFE ). At September
30, 2024, the SAFE Purchase Amount is . See Note 7. 

On
December 21, 2018, Mentor paid to purchase shares of NeuCourt common stock, representing approximately of NeuCourt s
issued and outstanding common stock at September 30, 2024. 

The
Company held an interest in a facilities operations company, Waste Consolidators Inc. WCI until October 2023. The Company
purchased a interest in WCI in 2003 and increased its ownership stake by in 2014. On October 4, 2023, the Company sold the entirety
of its ownership interest in WCI for . Following the sale, the Company received no new income from WCI and had no further involvement
or continuing influence over its operations. As a result of this sale, our facilities operations segment was eliminated, and its results
of operations, assets, and liabilities were excluded from our continuing operations. Therefore, WCI is presented as a discontinued operation
in our consolidated financial statements for the prior periods of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023. See Note 3. 

Note
2 - Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 

 as of September 30,
2024. The Company has recently received significant profit on the sale of its former majority owned subsidiary, although negative cash
flows from operations continue. 

Series D warrants outstanding, and the Company has reset the exercise price to per
share, which is below the current market price. The Company may reverse split the stock to raise the stock price to a level further above
the warrant exercise price. The warrants are specifically not affected and do not split with the shares in the event of a reverse split.
These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from repricing the outstanding warrants. 

Management s
plans include increasing revenues through acquisition, investment, and organic growth. Management anticipates funding new activities
by raising additional capital through the sale of equity securities and debt. 

on February 15, 2022, due to a reduction in our estimated
collection amount for the 2020 annual installment payment, which was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the terms of the investment
were modified, resulting in an additional loss of and at June 11, 2024 the receivable was fully impaired due to a history of
uncertain payments. The Company s recognition of an impairment loss due to the uncertainty of collection does not diminish its
contractual rights to collect the full amounts due pursuant to the contract. The Company intends to continue to vigorously pursue the
payment of the amounts owed by available legal means. See Note 4. 

The
risk of inflation, interest rate increases, tax increases, recession, high energy prices, and supply-demand imbalances are expected to
continue in 2024. 

We
anticipate that current cash and associated resources without new inflows would be sufficient for us to execute our business plan for
four years after the date these financial statements are issued. The ultimate impact of the war in Ukraine, the Israel-Hamas war, potential
cyber-attacks, inflation, interest rate increases, tax increases, and a potential recession on our business, results of operations, cybersecurity,
financial condition, and cash flows are dependent on future developments, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. 

Note

. Following the sale, the Company received
no new income from the discontinued operation, and it had no further involvement or continuing influence over its operations. As a result,
our facilities operations segment was deconsolidated on the date of the sale, and our former facilities operations segment is reported
as a discontinued operation. See Note 3.

into on or after January 1, 2019, for which the lease was expected to be extended to years, were classified as finance leases. Our
discontinued operation s leases had remaining lease terms of month to months. Our discontinued operation s fleet finance
leases contained a residual value guarantee. As most of our discontinued operation s leases did not provide an implicit rate, we
used our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date to determine the present value of lease
payments. 

Costs
associated with operating lease assets were recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, within cost of goods sold
for vehicles used in direct servicing of our discontinued operation customers and in operating expenses for costs associated with all
other operating leases. Finance lease assets were amortized within the cost of goods sold for vehicles used in direct servicing of our
discontinued operation customers and within operating expenses for all other finance lease assets on a straight-line basis over the shorter
of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease term. The interest component of a finance lease was included in interest expense
and recognized using the effective interest method over the lease term. Our discontinued operation had agreements that contained both
lease and non-lease components. For vehicle fleet operating leases, we accounted for lease components together with non-lease components
(e.g., maintenance fees). 

years to years; furniture and equipment, years; and vehicles and trailers, years to years. Depreciation on vehicles
used by our discontinued operation to service its customers is included in the cost of goods sold. All other depreciation is included
in selling, general, and administrative costs in the consolidated income statements. 

Expenditures
for major renewals and improvements are capitalized, while minor replacements, maintenance, and repairs, which do not extend the asset
lives, are charged to operations as incurred. Upon sale or disposition, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from
the accounts, and any gain or loss is included in operations. The Company continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that
could indicate that the carrying balances of its property and equipment may not be recoverable in accordance with the provisions of ASC
360, Property, Plant, and Equipment . When such events or changes in circumstances are present, the Company assesses
the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted
expected future cash flows. If the total of the future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, the Company recognizes
an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. See Note 6. 

Note
2 - Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 

The
Company reviews intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or if a change in circumstances
has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life. Conditions that may indicate impairment include,
but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset, or
an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. If an impairment indicator exists, we test the intangible asset for recoverability. For
purposes of the recoverability test, we group our amortizable intangible assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level
of identifiable cash flows if the intangible asset does not generate cash flows independent of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying
value of the intangible asset (asset group) exceeds the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition
of the intangible asset (asset group), the Company will write the carrying value down to the fair value in the period identified.

and a one-year note receivable. Following the sale, the Company received no new income from WCI and had no further involvement
or continuing influence over its operations. Prior to the sale, goodwill of was derived from consolidating WCI effective January
1, 2014, and of goodwill was derived from the 2003 acquisition of a interest in WCI. In accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill
and Other , goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives were no longer subject to amortization but were tested
for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired prior to the sale. Effective
October 4, 2023, on the date of the sale of our WCI shares, we met the criteria outlined in ASC Topic 205-20 Discontinued Operations , 
for our goodwill to be reduced to and the results of operations and assets and liabilities for our facilities operations
segment were excluded from our continuing operations and presented as a discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements.
As a result, goodwill in an aggregate amount of was reduced to . goodwill was reported in the Company s condensed
consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. See Note 3.

The
Company, through its subsidiaries Mentor Partner I, LLC and Mentor Partner II, LLC, was the lessor of manufacturing equipment subject
to leases under master leasing agreements. The leases contained an element of dealer profit and lessee bargain purchase options at prices
substantially below the subject assets estimated residual values at the exercise date for the options. Consequently, the Company
classified the leases as sales-type leases (the finance leases for financial accounting purposes. For such finance leases,
the Company reported the discounted present value of (i) future minimum lease payments (including the bargain purchase option, if any)
and (ii) any residual value not subject to a bargain purchase option as a finance lease receivable on its balance sheet and accrued interest
on the balance of the finance lease receivable based on the interest rate inherent in the applicable lease over the term of the lease.
For each finance lease, the Company recognized revenue in an amount equal to the net investment in the lease and cost of sales equal
to the net book value of the equipment at the inception of the applicable lease.

operation segment WCI and increased its ownership stake in WCI by in 2014. Since January 1, 2014, our controlling
interest investment in WCI included a facilities operations segment, which provided waste management and disposal services to business
park owners, governmental centers, and apartment complexes in Phoenix, Austin, San Antonio, Houston, and Dallas. On October 4, 2023,
the Company sold the entirety of its interest in WCI by entering into a Stock Purchase Agreement whereby the Company as a shareholder
of WCI sold all of its outstanding shares of stock to Ally Waste Services, LLC for . 

In
connection with the sale, the Company received net, after WCI debt payoff, in cash and a one-year unsecured, subordinated,
promissory note in the initial principal face amount of . The note accrues interest at per annum. For further disclosures
related to the promissory note receivable, see Note 5. 

At

period ended December 31, 2023 on Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 1, 2024 for further discussion
regarding the Company s former interest in WCI. 

Goodwill 

Effective
October 4, 2023, on the date of the sale of WCI, we met the criteria outlined in ASC Topic 205-20 Discontinued Operations , 
for our goodwill to be reduced to and the results of operations and assets and liabilities for our facilities operations
segment were excluded from our continuing operations and presented as a discontinued operation and reported in our consolidated financial
statements. As a result, goodwill in an aggregate amount of was reduced to at December 31, 2023.

Deconsolidation 

In
accordance with ASC Topic 810-10-40, Consolidation Overall Derecognition - Deconsolidation of a Subsidiary
or Derecognition of a Group of Assets, a parent company must deconsolidate a subsidiary as of the date the parent ceases to
have a controlling interest in that subsidiary and recognize a gain or loss in net income at that time. As a result, we deconsolidated
WCI from our consolidated financial statements on October 4, 2023 and recognized a gain on the disposal of discontinued operations totaling
 . The gain on disposal of discontinued operation represented the amount of our purchase price allocation at 
WCI assets and liabilities, net investment in of WCI earnings, and net investment in WCI distributions offset by the sale price as
of the disposal date of October 4, 2023. We have eliminated WCI from our consolidated financials on October 4, 2023. Accordingly, WCI
was excluded from the Company s continuing operations on December 31, 2023, and prior periods of comparison and WCI s financial
results are presented as a discontinued operation in the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

Segment
Reporting 

Due
to the sale of our entire ownership interest in WCI on October 4, 2023, our facilities operation segment was eliminated. Following our
sale of WCI, the Company received no new income from WCI and had no further involvement or continuing influence over its operations.
Consequently, we determined that the results from operations and assets and liabilities associated with our facilities operation segment
were to be excluded from our continuing operations and presented as a discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements
in accordance with ASC Topic 205-20-45, Discontinued Operations . As a result, we classified the results from operations
of our facilities accessories segment separately in captions titled discontinued operations on our consolidated income
statements for the current and prior year period at September 30, 2023. Because we divested our discontinued operation on October 4,
2023, there were no discontinued operations to report at September 30, 2024. Prior to the sale, on September 30, 2023, our facilities

Company valued the transaction based on the market value of Company common shares exchanged in the transaction, resulting in a 
discount from the face value of the account receivable. The discount is being amortized monthly to interest over the 11-year term of
the agreement. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we were notified that due to the effect of COVID-19 on the estimated receivable, we may
not receive the 2020 installment payment or the full 2021 installment payment. Based on management s collection estimates, we recorded
an investment loss of on the investment in account receivable at December 31, 2020. In 2021, the Company re-evaluated estimated

set off against any indemnification obligations owed by the Company to Ally, which indemnification obligations are secondary to indemnification
obligations owed by the other WCI selling shareholder to Ally. The Company has continued to receive assurances from Ally that the purchased
business is performing well, and the note will be paid, so management has not impaired the note receivable. If management is given any
indication from Ally or the other selling shareholder of WCI that collection is uncertain, the Company will impair the note receivable
at such time. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our note receivable consisted of the following:

, the Company filed for voluntary reorganization with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of
California, and on January 11, 2000, the Company s Plan of Reorganization was approved. Among other things, the Company s
Plan of Reorganization allowed creditors and claimants to receive new Series A, B, C, and D warrants in settlement of their prior claims.
The warrants expire on May 11, 2038. 

Note
11 - Common stock warrants (continued) 

All
Series A, B, C, and D warrants have been called, and all Series A, B, and C warrants have been exercised. The Company intends to allow
warrant holders or Company designees, in place of original holders, additional time as needed to exercise the remaining Series D warrants.
The Company may lower the exercise price of all or part of a warrant series at any time. Similarly, the Company could reverse split the
stock to raise the stock price further above the warrant exercise price. The warrants are specifically not affected and do not split
with the shares in the event of a reverse split. If the called warrants are not exercised, the Company has the right to designate the
warrants to a new holder in return for a per share redemption fee payable to the original warrant holders. All such changes in
the exercise price of warrants were provided for by the court in the Plan of Reorganization to provide a mechanism for all debtors to
receive value even if they could not or did not exercise their warrants. Therefore, Management believes that the act of lowering the
exercise price is not a change from the original warrant grants, and the Company did not record an accounting impact as the result of
such change in exercise prices. 

Exercise
prices in effect from January 1, 2015 through September 30, 2023 for Series D warrants were per share plus a per warrant
redemption fee, if applicable. On October 14, 2023, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a reset of the Series D warrants
strike price to plus the per warrant redemption fee, if applicable, and the exercise price in effect at September 30, 2024
for the Series D warrants is per share plus a per warrant redemption fee, if applicable. 

In
2009, the Company entered into an Investment Banking agreement with Network 1 Financial Securities, Inc. and a related Strategic Advisory
Agreement with Lenox Hill Partners, LLC regarding a potential merger with a cancer development company. In conjunction with those related
agreements, the Company issued Series H Warrants, with a -year life. On November 14, 2022, the Series H Warrants
of Lenox Hill Partners, LLC were canceled pursuant to a Settlement Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, there
were Series H Warrants outstanding. The warrants are subject to cashless exercise based upon the ten-day trailing closing
bid price preceding the exercise as interpreted by the Company. 

As

On
February 9, 2015, in accordance with Section 1145 of the United States Bankruptcy Code and the Company s Third Amended Plan of
Reorganization, the Company announced a minimum 30-day partial redemption of up to 1 of the already outstanding Series D warrants to
provide for the court specified redemption mechanism for warrants not exercised timely by the original holder or their estates. Company
designees that applied during the 30 days paid 10 cents per warrant to redeem the warrant and then exercised the Series D warrant to
purchase a share of the Company s Common Stock at the court-specified formula of not more than one-half of the closing bid price
on the day preceding the 30-day exercise period. In successive months, the authorized partial warrant redemption amount was recalculated,
and the redemption offer repeated according to the court formula. In the Company s October 7, 2016 press release, Mentor stated
that the 1 redemptions which were formerly priced on a calendar month schedule would subsequently be initiated and priced on a random
date schedule after the prior 1 redemption was completed to prevent potential third-party manipulation of share prices at month-end.
The periodic partial redemptions could continue to be recalculated and repeated until such unexercised warrants are exhausted, or the
partial redemption is otherwise paused, or truncated by the Company. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 no warrants
were redeemed. 

redemption fee to the former holders. Certain individuals desiring to become
a Company designee to redeem warrants have deposited redemption fees with the Company that, when warrants are redeemed, will be forwarded
to the former warrant holders through DTCC or at their last known address 30 days after the last warrant of a class is exercised, or
earlier at the discretion of the Company. The Company has arranged for a service to process the redemption fees in offset to an equal
amount of liability. 

In
prior years the Series A, Series B, and Series C redemption fees have been distributed through DTCC into holder s brokerage accounts
or directly to the holders. All Series A, Series B, and Series C warrants have been exercised and are no longer outstanding. 

Once
the Series D warrants have been fully redeemed and exercised, the fees for the Series D warrant series will likewise be distributed.
Mr. Billingsley has agreed to assume liability for paying these redemption fees and therefore warrant redemption fees received are retained
by the Company for operating costs. Should Mr. Billingsley be incapacitated or otherwise become unable to pay the warrant redemption
fees, the Company will remit the warrant redemption fees to former holders from amounts otherwise due to Mr. Billingsley from the Company,
which are sufficient to cover the redemption fees at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

contained in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes to the financial statements included within

ended December 31, 2023 on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 1, 2024. 

We
sold the entirety of our majority ownership interest in Waste Consolidators, Inc. WCI on October 4, 2023 for 6,000,000,
resulting in the elimination of our facilities operations segment at that time. Accordingly, the results of operations and assets and

Corporate
Background 

The
Company s common stock trades publicly under the trading symbol OTCQB: MNTR. 

The
Company was originally founded as an investment partnership in Silicon Valley, by the current CEO in 1985. The partnership acquired a
salsa factory, bakery, trucking company, tortilla chip plant, and an athletic club chain. The former investment partnership was incorporated
under the laws of the State of California on July 29, 1994 and on September 12, 1996, the Company s offering statement was qualified
under Regulation A of the Securities Act of 1933 and began to trade its shares publicly. The Company relocated to San Diego, California,
and contracted to provide financial assistance and investment in small businesses. On September 24, 2015, the Company redomiciled from
California to Delaware by merging the California Mentor Capital, Inc. corporation into a newly formed Delaware entity, Mentor Capital,
Inc. Following the merger, the Company is governed under the laws of the State of Delaware. In September 2020, Mentor relocated its corporate
office from San Diego, California, to Plano, Texas. 

In
the public arena, the Company continues its diverse investment activities. These have included the acquisition of oil and gas partnerships,
New York Stock Exchange gas trading company mini-tender offers, ATM ownership, facilities operations investment, cancer immunotherapy
investment, equipment financing, intellectual property investment, litigation financing, investment in a dispute resolution company,
and discounted funding of annuity-like fund flows. Most recently, from its new Texas base, the Company has signaled a substantial return
to its energy roots, starting with a tracking investment in five New York Stock Exchange energy companies in the oil and gas, coal, and
uranium markets and cooperatively acquiring operating companies in these classic energy markets.

centers, and apartment complexes in Phoenix, Austin, San Antonio, Houston, and Dallas. Following the sale, the Company received no

discontinued operation. WCI had been a long-standing investment, but it no longer aligns with the Company s central business
focus in the energy sector. The 6,000,000 proceeds from the sale of our WCI shares provided the Company with seed capital to seek
out new business opportunities in the classic energy space.

right of payment of the indebtedness of borrowed money and obligations of Ally owed to senior lenders. Subject to the terms of agreements
with senior lenders, the note principal plus accrued interest is payable on October 4, 2024. Ally s failure to pay the principal
and accrued interest on October 4, 2024, among other enumerated events of default, will result in the interest rate retroactively increasing
to 12 per annum. The note may be set off against any indemnification obligations owed by the Company to Ally, which indemnification
obligations are secondary to indemnification obligations owed by the other WCI selling shareholder to Ally. The Company has continued
to receive assurances from Ally that the purchased business is performing well, and the note will be paid, so management has not impaired
the note receivable. If management is given any indication from Ally or the other WCI selling shareholder that collection is uncertain,
the Company will impair the note receivable at such time. 

Overview 

The
Company maintains a diverse and opportunistic acquisition focus. It sold its former legacy investment in the former facilities operations
segment and continues looking to expand into the classic energy markets of oil, gas, coal, uranium, and related markets. 

Business
Approach 

Our
general headquarters functions are aimed at providing accounting, legal, and general business support for our larger investment targets
and our majority-owned subsidiaries. We monitor our smaller and less than majority positions for value and investment security. Management
also spends considerable effort reviewing possible acquisition candidates on an ongoing basis. 

Mentor
seeks to take significant positions in target companies to provide public market liquidity for founders, protection for investors, funding
for the companies, and incubate private companies that Mentor believes to have significant potential. When Mentor takes a major position
in its investees, it provides financial management when needed but leaves operating control in the hands of the company founders. Retaining
control, receiving greater liquidity, and working with an experienced organization to efficiently develop disclosures and compliance
that are similar to what is required of public companies are three potential key advantages to company founders working with Mentor Capital,
Inc. 

The
Company continually works to identify potential acquisitions, investments, and divestitures. While evaluating whether an acquisition
or divestiture may be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, no transaction will be announced until that transaction
is certain. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

The
Company s future success depends upon its ability to make a return on its investments, generate positive cash flow, and obtain
sufficient capital from non-portfolio-related sources. Management believes they have approximately four years of operating resources
on hand and can raise additional funds as may be needed to support their business plan and develop an operating, cash flow positive company.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Continuing
Operations 

Since
our reorganization, we have raised capital through warrant holder exercise of warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock. At September
30, 2024 we had cash and cash equivalents of 1,682,845 and working capital of 3,316,615. 

Operating
cash inflows in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 574,818), including 786,897) of net income (loss), increased by non-cash
depreciation and amortization of 807, gain (loss) on investments at fair value of 19,925), a decrease in operating assets of 50,781),
a decrease in operating liabilities of 1,479, non-cash amortization of discount on investment in account receivable of 9,559), and
a 250,208 loss on long-term investments. 

Net
change in cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 748,454) consisting of cash outflows from operations in the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 of 574,818) plus cash outflows from financing activities including 286) paid in capital for
Company common stock repurchases and 173,350) in payments on repurchases of the Company s common stock. 

We
will seek to raise additional funds through financing, additional collaborative relationships, or other arrangements to increase revenues
to support positive cash flow. 

- 36 - 

In
addition, on February 9, 2015, in accordance with Section 1145 of the United States Bankruptcy Code and the Company s court-approved
Plan of Reorganization, the Company announced a minimum 30-day partial redemption of up to 1 of the already outstanding Series D warrants
to provide for the court specified redemption mechanism for warrants not exercised timely by the original holder or their estates. Company
designees that applied during the 30 days paid 10 cents per warrant to redeem the warrant and then exercised the Series D warrant to
purchase a share at the court-specified formula of not more than one-half of the closing bid price on the day preceding the 30-day exercise
period. In the Company s October 7, 2016 press release, Mentor stated that the 1 redemptions, which were formerly priced on a
calendar month schedule, would subsequently be initiated and be priced on a random date to be scheduled after the prior 1 redemption
is completed to prevent potential third party manipulation of share prices at month-end. The periodic partial redemptions may continue
to be recalculated and repeated until such unexercised warrants are exhausted or the partial redemption is otherwise temporarily paused,
suspended, or truncated by the Company. 

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no redemptions of Series D Warrants. There were no redemptions of Series
D Warrants in 2023. We believe that if warrants are redeemed and exercised, partial warrant redemptions will provide monthly cash for
monthly operations. 

Disclosure
About Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We
do not have any transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements that constitute off-balance sheet arrangements.

As
a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to provide the information
called for by this item. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of disclosure controls and procedures 

Management,
with the participation of our chief executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures,
management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance
of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that
there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls
and procedures relative to their costs. 

Based
on management s evaluation, our chief executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024,
our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance
that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our
managers, including our chief executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. 

Changes
in internal control over financial reporting. 

We
regularly review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our processes and systems to improve controls
and increase efficiency while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities
as implementing new, more efficient systems, consolidating activities, and migrating processes. 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have
materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings. 

G
FarmaLabs Limited 

On
August 27, 2021, the Company and Mentor Partner I settled certain litigation with G FarmaLabs Limited, a Nevada corporation, and certain
of its affiliates (the G Farma Settlors ). The G Farma Settlors partially performed, and then breached, the Settlement Agreement. 

Consequently,
in February 2023, the Company and Mentor Partner I filed a Request for Entry of Judgment seeking entry of a stipulated judgment against
the G Farma Settlors for (1) the remaining unpaid settlement amount of 494,450 promised, all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and
an additional 2,000,000 principal amount as agreed in the Settlement Agreement, (2) the Company s incurred costs, and (3) attorneys 
fees paid by the Company to obtain the judgment. On July 11, 2023, the Court entered judgment against the G Farma Settlors and in favor
of Mentor and Partner I in the amount of 2,539,597, which is comprised of 2,494,450 of principal (calculated as the aggregate settlement
amount, less payments made by the G Farma Settlors, plus the default addition) plus accrued and unpaid interest of 40,219, costs of
 1,643, and attorneys fees of 3,285 incurred by Mentor and Mentor Partner I in connection with obtaining the judgment. The judgment
also accrues post-judgment interest at the rate of 10 from July 11, 2023, until such time as the judgment is paid in full. 

The
Company has retained the reserve on the unpaid notes receivable balance and collections of the unpaid lease receivable balance due to
the long history of uncertain payments from G Farma and the G Farma Settlors. Payments recovered will be reported as Other income in
the consolidated income statements. See Notes 1, 8, and 16 to this Quarterly Report and Notes 1, 8, 9, and 18 to Company s Annual
Report for the period ended December 31, 2023 on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 1, 2024. The 2,539,597
judgment and interest receivable of 311,014 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is fully reserved pending the outcome of the
Company s collection process. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors. 

In
addition to other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating
our business since it operates in a highly changing and complex business environment that involves numerous risks, some of which are
beyond our control. The following discussion highlights a few of these risk factors, any one of which may have a significant adverse
impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. 

As
a result of the risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q and in our Form 10-K, and the risks discussed in our Rule
15c2-11 and other publicly disclosed submissions, actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking
statements. 

We
face significant risks, and the risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks that we do not know of or that
we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following
risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed, and the trading price of our Common
Stock could decline. 

- 38 - 

Our
auditor has changed. 

On
May 3, 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission entered an Order Instituting Public Administrative
and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 4C and 21C of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 and Rule 102(e) of the Commission s Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist
Order (the Order whereby the Company s then auditor, BF Borgers CPA PC BF Borgers was banned from
appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant. On May 3, 2024, the Commission issued a Staff Statement on Issuer Disclosure
and Reporting Obligations in Light of Rule 102(e) Order against BF Borgers CPA PC Staff Statement which stated that BF
Borgers is no longer permitted to appear or practice before the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result of the Order and the
Staff Statement, Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings filed on or after May 3, 2024 may not present financial information that has been reviewed
by BF Borgers. Annual and quarterly periods presented in the Company s annual and quarterly reports must be reviewed by the Company s
new independent registered public accountant who is qualified, PCAOB-registered, and permitted to appear or practice before the Securities
and Exchange Commission. In light of the Order, the Audit Committee dismissed BF Borgers as our independent registered public accounting
firm on May 8, 2024. On May 15, 2024, the Company s audit committee and Board of Directors unanimously approved the engagement
of Spicer Jeffries LLP as the Company s independent registered public accountant, effective immediately. 

We
may incur material expenses or delays in financings or SEC filings due to the dismissal of BF Borgers and our stock price and access
to the capital markets may be affected. 

As
a public company, we are required to file annual and quarterly financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission which
are audited or reviewed, as applicable, by independent registered public accountant who are PCAOB-registered, and permitted to appear
and practice before the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our access to the capital markets and our ability to make timely filings
with the Securities and Exchange Commission will depend on having financial statements re-audited and re-reviewed by independent registered
public accountants who are PCAOB-registered and permitted to appear and practice before the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition,
we may experience delays in working with potential acquisition targets or lenders until our financial statements are re-audited and reviewed
by a new auditor. As a result, we may encounter delays, additional audit expenses, and other material costs due to our inability to rely
on our previously reviewed and audited financial statements due to the dismissal of BF Borgers. Any resulting delay in accessing or inability
to access the public capital markets could be disruptive to our operations and could affect the price and liquidity of our securities.
Any negative news about the proceedings against BF Borgers may also adversely affect investor confidence and public perception of the
Company. All of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, the market price of our common stock, and our ability
to access the capital markets. 

Variable
financial conditions can be challenging. 

Prior
to the profitable October 4, 2023 sale of our discontinued operation we experienced cash flows challenges. Securing additional sources
of financing to enable us to increase investing in our target markets will be difficult, and there is no assurance of our ability to
secure such financing. A failure to obtain additional financing, or to continue to generate capital from the sale of operating businesses
and assets, or to generate positive cash flow from operations could prevent us from continuing to seek out and invest in larger new companies. 

Mentor
will continue to attempt to raise capital resources from both related and unrelated parties. Management s plans include monetizing
existing mature business projects and increasing revenues through acquisition, investment, and organic growth. Management anticipates
funding new activities by raising additional capital through the sale of equity securities and debt. 

- 39 - 

A
failure to obtain future financing could prevent us from executing our business plan. 

We
anticipate that current cash resources and opportunities without new inflows would be sufficient for us to execute our business plan
for four years after the date these financial statements are issued. We believe that securing substantial additional sources of financing
is possible, but there is no assurance of our ability to secure such financing. A failure to obtain additional financing could prevent
us from making substantial expenditures for advancement and growth to partner with businesses and hire additional personnel. If we raise
additional future financing by selling equity, or convertible debt securities, the relative equity ownership of our existing investors
could be diluted, or the new investors could obtain terms more favorable than previous investors. If we raise additional funds through
debt financing, we could incur significant borrowing costs and be subject to adverse consequences in the event of a default. 

Management
voluntarily transitioned to a fully reporting company and spends considerable time meeting the associated reporting obligations. 

Management
operated Mentor Capital, Inc. as a non-reporting public company for over 28 years and approximately 9 years ago voluntarily transitioned
to reporting company status subject to financial and other SEC-required disclosures. Prior to such voluntary transition, management had
not been required to prepare and make such required disclosures. As a reporting company, we may be subject to the Securities and Exchange
Act, as amended Exchange Act ), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, and other securities rules and regulations.
If we were listed on an Exchange, we would be subject to the rules of the Exchange on which we were listed. The Exchange Act requires,
among other things, that we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and operating activities. Preparing
and filing periodic reports imposes a significant expense, time, and reporting burden on management. This distraction can divert management
from its operation of the business to the detriment of core operations. 

Investors
may suffer risk of dilution following exercise of warrants for cash. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had 21,830,393 outstanding shares of its Common Stock trading at approximately 0.056 per share. As
of the same date, the Company also had 4,250,000 outstanding Series D warrants exercisable for shares of Common Stock at 0.02 per share.
These Series D warrants do not have a cashless exercise feature. The Company estimates that the warrants may be increasingly exercised
anytime the per share price of the Company s Common Stock is greater than 0.24 per share. Exercise of these Series D warrants
may result in immediate and potentially substantial dilution to current holders of the Company s Common Stock. In addition, the
Company has 413,512 outstanding Series H warrants with a per share exercise price of 7.00 held by an investment bank and its affiliates.
These 7.00 Series H warrants include a cashless exercise feature. Current and future shareholders may suffer dilution of their investment
and equity ownership if any of the warrant holders elect to exercise their warrants. 

Beginning
on February 9, 2015, in accordance with Section 1145 of the United States Bankruptcy Code and in accordance with the Company s
court-approved Plan of Reorganization, the Company announced that it would allow for partial redemption of up to 1 per month of the
outstanding Series D warrants to provide for the court specified redemption mechanism for warrants not exercised timely by the original
holder or their estates. On October 7, 2016, the Company announced that the 1 redemptions which were formerly priced on a calendar month
schedule would subsequently be initiated and priced on a random date to be scheduled after the prior 1 redemption is complete to prevent
potential third-party manipulation of share prices during the pricing period at month-end. Company designees that apply during the redemption
period must pay 10 cents per warrant to redeem the warrants and then exercise the Series D warrant to purchase a share of the Company s
Common Stock at a maximum of one-half of the closing bid price on the day preceding the 1 partial redemption. The 1 partial redemption
may continue to be periodically recalculated and repeated according to the court formula until such unexercised warrants are exhausted,
or the partial redemption is otherwise suspended or truncated by the Company. There were no warrant redemptions during 2024 or 2023. 

Our
business model is to partner with or acquire other companies. 

We
aim to find energy businesses whose products, managers, technology, or other factors that we like and then acquire or invest in
those businesses. While we are open to investing in a diverse portfolio of entities across the energy sector, there is no certainty
that we will find suitable partners or that we will be able to engage in transactions on advantageous terms with the partners we
identify. There is also no certainty that we will be able to consummate future transactions on favorable terms, or any new
transaction at all. To date, several of our acquisitions/investments have not turned out well for us. 

- 40 - 

We
may have to work harder to introduce rigor in our transactions. 

Many
of the people and entities with whom we engage may not be used to operating in business transactions in a public environment. Therefore,
in order to discharge our fiduciary and disclosure obligations, we may have to work harder to maintain good business practices. Entities
and persons operating in private industry may be unaccustomed to entering into detailed written agreements or keeping financial records
according to GAAP. Additionally, entities and persons with whom we had engaged may not pay particular attention to the obligations with
which they have agreed in written contracts. We have experienced or may experience differences in this manner with several different
entities with whom we do business, including several entities that failed to comply with common law contractual obligations, which led
us into litigation and other legal remedies. 

Our
actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in our forward-looking statements. 

This
Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws that relate to future events or future
financial performance. When used in this report, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as believes, 
 anticipates, seeks, looks, hopes, plans, predicts, 
 expects, estimates, intends, will, continue, may, 
 potential, should, and similar expressions. These statements are only expressions of expectation. Our actual
results could, and likely will, differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements as a result of many factors,
including those set forth above and elsewhere in this report and including factors unanticipated by us and not included herein. Although
we believe that the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels
of activity, performance, or achievements. Neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of
these statements. Accordingly, we caution readers not to place undue reliance on these statements. Where required by applicable law,
we will undertake to update any disclosures or forward-looking statements. 

If
we are unable to protect our property, our competitive position would be adversely affected. 

We
and our partners and subsidiaries intend to rely on contracts and agreements with to protect our property rights. If we, or our affiliates
and partners, fail to protect property rights, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would suffer. In the future,
we may be forced to pay significant amounts to defend our rights, and a substantial amount of the attention of our management may be
diverted from our ongoing business, all of which would materially adversely affect our business. 

We
depend on our key personnel and may have difficulty attracting and retaining the skilled staff and outside professionals we need to execute
our growth plans. 

Our
success will be dependent largely upon the personal efforts of our Chief Executive Officer, Chet Billingsley. The loss of Mr. Billingsley
could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. Currently, we have two full-time employees, and we substantially
rely on the services provided by outside professionals. To execute our plans, we will have to retain our current employees and work with
outside professionals who we believe will help us achieve our goals. Competition for recruiting and retaining highly skilled employees
with technical, management, marketing, sales, product development, and other specialized training is intense. We may not be successful
in employing and retaining such qualified personnel. Specifically, we may experience increased costs in order to retain skilled employees.
If we are unable to retain experienced employees and the services of outside professionals as needed, we may be unable to execute our
business plan. 

Founder
and CEO Chet Billingsley, along with other members of the Company s Board of Directors, have considerable control over the company
through their aggregate ownership of approximately 14.40 of the outstanding shares of the Company s Common Stock on a fully diluted
basis. 

As
of September 30, 2024, Mr. Billingsley owned approximately 8.33 of the outstanding shares of the Company s Common Stock on a fully
diluted basis. Together with other members of the Company s Board of Directors, management of the Company owns approximately 14.40 
of the outstanding shares of the Company s Common Stock on a fully diluted basis. Mr. Billingsley also holds 47,274 Series D warrants,
exercisable at 0.02 per share. Additionally, Robert Meyer and Lori Stansfield, directors of the Company, hold an aggregate of 628,955
Series D warrants exercisable at 0.02 per share. Due to the large number of shares of Common Stock owned by Mr. Billingsley and the
directors of the Company, management has considerable ability to exercise control over the Company and matters submitted for shareholder
approval, including the election of directors and approval of any merger, consolidation or sale of substantially all of the assets of
the Company. Additionally, due to his position as CEO and Chairman of the Board, Mr. Billingsley has the ability to control the management
and affairs of the Company. The Company s directors and Mr. Billingsley owe a fiduciary duty to our shareholders and are required to act in
good faith in a manner each reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our shareholders. As shareholders, Mr. Billingsley and
the other directors are entitled to vote their shares in their own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our shareholders
generally. 

- 41 - 

We
face rapid change. 

The
market for our partners and subsidiaries products and services is characterized by rapidly changing laws, political climate,
technologies, and the introduction of new products and services. We believe that our future success will depend in part upon our ability
to work with companies that develop and enhance products and services offered in the energy and dispute resolution industries. There
can be no assurance that our partners and subsidiaries will be able to develop and execute products and services or enhance initial products
in a timely manner to apply and satisfy customer needs, achieve market acceptance or address changes in our target markets. Failure to
apply and develop products and services and introduce them successfully and in a timely manner could adversely affect our competitive
position, financial condition, and results of operations. 

If
we experience rapid growth, we will need to manage such growth well. 

We
may experience substantial growth in the size of our staff and the scope of our operations, resulting in increased responsibilities for
management. To manage this possible growth effectively, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management
information systems, will possibly need to create departments that do not now exist, and hire, train, motivate and manage a growing number
of staff. Due to a competitive employment environment for qualified accounting, technical, marketing, and sales personnel, we may experience
difficulty in filling our needs for qualified personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively achieve or manage
any future growth, and our failure to do so could delay market penetration or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition and results of operations. 

We
could face product liability risks and may not have adequate insurance. 

Our
partners and affiliates products may be used for sensitive purposes. We may become the subject of litigation alleging that
our partners and affiliates products were pollutive, ineffective, or unsafe. Thus, we may become the target of lawsuits
from injured or disgruntled customers or other users. We intend to, but do not now, carry product and liability insurance, but in the
event that we are required to defend more than a few such actions, or in the event we are found liable in connection with such an action,
our business and operations may be severely and materially adversely affected. 

There
is a limited market for our Common Stock. 

Our
Common Stock is not listed on any exchange and trades on the OTC Markets OTCQB system. As such, the market for our Common Stock is limited
and is not regulated by the rules and regulations of any exchange. Freely trading shares of even fully reporting OTCBQ companies like
ours receive careful scrutiny by brokers who may require legal opinion letters, proof of consideration, medallion guarantees, or expensive
fee payments before accepting or declining share deposits. Further, the price of our Common Stock and its volume in the market may be
subject to wide fluctuations. Our stock price could decline regardless of our actual operating performance, and stockholders could lose
a substantial part of their investment as a result of industry or market-based fluctuations. Our stock may trade relatively thinly. If
a more active public market for our stock is not sustained, it may be difficult for stockholders to sell shares of our Common Stock.
Because we do not now pay cash dividends on our Common Stock, stockholders may not be able to receive a return on their shares unless
they are able to sell them. The market price of our Common Stock will likely fluctuate in response to a number of factors, including
but not limited to the following: 

sales,
 sales cycle, and market acceptance or rejection of energy products and services; 

our
 ability to engage with partners who are successful in their markets; 

economic
 conditions within the markets; 

- 42 - 

the
 timing of announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts or acquisitions or publicity regarding actual or potential
 results or performance thereof; 

domestic
 and international economic, business, and political conditions; 

justified
 or unjustified adverse publicity; and 

proper
 or improper third-party short sales or other manipulation of our stock. 

We
have a long business and corporate existence. 

We
began in Silicon Valley in 1985 as a limited partnership and operated as Mentor Capital, LP until we incorporated in California in 1994.
We were privately owned until September 1996; at which time our Common Stock began trading on the Over The Counter Pink Sheets. Our merger
and acquisition and business development activities have spanned many business sectors, and we went through a bankruptcy reorganization
in 1998. In late 2015, we reincorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. We have operated in several different industries over
our existence but do not have brand recognition within any one industry. 

Failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could have a material
adverse effect on our stock price. 

Section
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules and regulations of the SEC require annual management assessments of the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting. If we fail to adequately maintain compliance with, or maintain the adequacy of, our
internal control over financial reporting, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able
to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules and regulations of the SEC. If we cannot favorably assess our internal
controls over financial reporting, investor confidence in the reliability of our financial reports may be adversely affected, which could
have a material adverse effect on our stock price. 

We
have indemnified our officers and directors. 

We
have indemnified our officers and directors against possible monetary liability to the maximum extent permitted under California and
Delaware law. The managers of Mentor Partner I, LLC, Mentor Partner II, LLC, and TWG, LLC have been indemnified to the maximum extent
permitted under Texas law. 

The
worldwide economy could impact the Company in numerous ways. 

The
effects of negative worldwide economic events, such as the impact of inflation, interest rate increases, tariff increases, recession,
potential banking crises, cybersecurity risks, evolving and sophisticated cyber-attacks and other attempts to gain access to our information
technology systems, the war in Ukraine, the Israel-Hamas war, product and labor shortages, increased risk to oil and energy markets,
and a global economic slowdown may cause disruptions and extreme volatility in global financial markets, increased rates of default and
bankruptcy, political change, impact levels of consumer spending, and may impact our business, operating results, or financial condition.
The ongoing worldwide economic, political, and military situations, future weakness in the credit markets, and significant liquidity problems for the financial
services industries may also impact our financial condition in a number of ways. For example, current or potential partners and affiliates
may not pay us, or our partners or affiliates may delay paying us or our partners or affiliates for previously purchased products and
services. Our involvement in the classic energy sector may draw political or regulatory backlash even if our actions are entirely legal
and beneficial to the American society as a whole. Also, we may have difficulties in securing additional financing. 

Shareholders,
Directors, Partners, Professionals, and Employees May Disagree with Management s Plan and Direction for the Company. 

In
any organization, some individuals will have differing views on the best approach that the Company should follow to optimize results.
These differences can sometimes even evolve into personal conflicts that are a distraction to management. With over four decades of senior
management experience current leadership has rarely but occasionally encountered these sorts of diverging opinions as to how the Company
should proceed. Disagreements of this nature have recently been addressed but may again continue or reappear in the future and randomly
over time.
