CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Report of Motorsport Games Inc. (the Company, Motorsport Games, 
 we, us or our contains certain statements, which are not historical facts and are forward-looking
statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks, trends
and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations and projections relating to our financial condition, results
of operations, plans, objectives, strategies, future performance and business. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact
that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. We use words, such as could, would, may, 
 might, will, expect, likely, believe, continue, anticipate, 
 estimate, intend, plan, project and other similar expressions to identify some
forward-looking statements, but not all forward-looking statements include these words. For example, forward-looking statements include,
but are not limited to, statements we make relating to: 

our
 liquidity and capital requirements, including, without limitation, as to our ability to continue as a going concern; our belief that
 we will not have sufficient cash on hand to fund our operations over the next year based on the cash and cash equivalents available
 and our average cash burn; our belief that additional funding will be required in order to continue operations; our expectation that
 we will continue to have a net cash outflow from operations for the foreseeable future as we continue to develop our product portfolio
 and invest in developing new video game titles; our expectation that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future
 as we continue to incur significant expenses; our plans to address our liquidity short fall, including our exploration of several
 options, including, but not limited to: additional funding in the form of potential equity and/or debt financing arrangements or
 similar transactions, strategic alternatives for our business, including, but not limited to, the sale or licensing of our assets,
 and further cost reduction and restructuring initiatives; our expectation that if any strategic alternative is executed, this would
 help to reduce certain working capital requirements and reduce overhead expenditures, thereby reducing our expected future cash-burn,
 and provide some short-term liquidity relief, but that we will continue to require additional funding and/or further cost reduction
 measures in order to continue operations, which includes further restructuring of our business and operations; our plan to continue
 to seek to reduce our monthly net cash-burn by reducing our cost base through maintaining and enhancing cost control initiatives,
 and plans to continue to evaluate the structure of our business for additional changes in order to improve both our near-term and
 long-term liquidity position; statements regarding potential alternatives we may be required to adopt if we are unable to satisfy
 our capital requirements, and our belief that if we are ultimately unable to satisfy our capital requirements, we would likely need
 to dissolve and liquidate our assets under the bankruptcy laws or otherwise; our belief that there is a substantial likelihood that
 Driven Lifestyle Group LLC Driven Lifestyle ), formerly known as Motorsport Network, LLC, will not fulfill our future
 borrowing requests under the 12 million Line of Credit (as defined in this Report); and statements regarding our cash flows and
 anticipated uses of cash; 

the
 sale of our NASCAR License (as defined in this Report), including our belief that our existing business model will need to be modified,
 our risk profile relating to our operations will be significantly altered, we may encounter difficulties or challenges in continuing
 operations due to the sale of the license, and that our cash flows and results of operations will likely be materially adversely
 impacted as we anticipate the amount of revenue to be generated by our existing NASCAR products to decline over time; 

our
 intended corporate purpose to make the thrill of motorsports accessible to everyone by creating the highest quality, most sophisticated
 and most innovative experiences for racers, gamers and fans of all ages; 

new
 or planned products or offerings, including the anticipated timing of any new product or offering launches, such as our current plans
 to organize the 2024/25 Le Mans Virtual Series to commence later this year, as well as the possibility of further adjustments to
 our product roadmap due to the continuing impact of our liquidity position; 

ii 

our
 plans to strive to become a leader in organizing and facilitating esports tournaments, competitions, and events for our licensed
 racing games as well as on behalf of third-party racing game developers and publishers; 

our
 intention to continue exploring opportunities to expand the recurring portion of our esports segment outside of the Le Mans Virtual
 Series; 

our
 belief that connecting virtual racing gamers and esports fans on a digital entertainment and social platform represents the greatest
 opportunity to enhance the way that people learn, watch, play, and experience racing video games and racing esports; 

our
 beliefs regarding the growing importance and business viability of esports, especially within the racing and motorsport genres; 

our
 belief that our esports business has the potential to generate incremental revenues through the further sale of media rights to our
 esports events and competitions, as well as, among other things, merchandising, if the esports audience pattern continues to grow; 

our
 plans to drive ongoing engagement and incremental revenue from recurrent consumer spending on our titles through in-game purchases
 and extra content; 

our
 expectation that we will continue to derive significant revenues from sales of our products to a very limited number of distribution
 partners; 

our
 intention to continue to look for opportunities to expand the recurring portion of our business, including through the planned introduction
 of new annualized sports franchise games, such as with Le Mans; 

our
 intended use of proceeds from the sales of our equity securities; 

our
 statements and assumptions relating to the impairment of assets; 

our
 plans and intentions with respect to our remediation efforts to address the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial
 reporting; 

our
 belief that the outcome of all pending legal proceedings in the aggregate is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect
 on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows, except as otherwise disclosed in this Report,
 and that in light of the uncertainties involved in legal proceedings generally, the ultimate outcome of a particular matter could
 be material to our operating results for a particular period depending on, among other things, the size of the loss or the nature
 of the liability imposed and the level of our income for that particular period; our beliefs regarding the merit of any plaintiff s
 allegations and the impact of any claims and litigation that we are subject to; and our plans and intentions with respect to defending
 our position in any legal proceeding; 

our
 intention to not declare dividends in the foreseeable future; 

our
 ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards; 

our
 expectations regarding the future impact of implementing management strategies, adopting new accounting standards, potential acquisitions
 and industry trends; 

our
 plans and intentions to maintain compliance with the listing requirements of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC NASDAQ ),
 including our plan to implement equity financing transactions; 

iii 

our
 belief that we may decide in the future to avail ourselves of certain corporate governance requirements of NASDAQ as a result of
 being a controlled company within the meaning of the NASDAQ rules; 

our
 expectations relating to any cost reduction and restructuring initiatives, including expected savings and any restructuring charges
 to be incurred; and 

our
 expectations that our current development operations will not have significant exposure to changes in circumstances arising from
 the Ukraine-Russia and Middle East conflicts. 

The
forward-looking statements contained in this Report are based on assumptions that we have made in light of our industry experience and
our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe are appropriate
under the circumstances. As you read and consider this Report, you should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance
or results. They involve risks, uncertainties (many of which are beyond our control) and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Although
we believe that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many factors could affect
our actual operating and financial performance and cause our performance to differ materially from the performance anticipated in the
forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking
statements are discussed in Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2023 (the 2023 Form 10-K ), our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, as well as any amendments thereto, and in
 Risk Factors in Part II, Item 1A of this Report, as updated in our subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the SEC ). In addition to factors that may be described in our filings with the SEC, including this Report,
the following factors, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking
statements made by us: 

(i) 
 difficulties
 and/or delays in accessing available liquidity, and other unanticipated difficulties in resolving our continuing financial condition
 and ability to obtain additional capital to meet our financial obligations, including, without limitation, difficulties in securing
 funding that is on commercially acceptable terms to us or at all, such as our inability to complete in whole or in part any potential
 debt and/or equity financing transactions or similar transactions, any inability to achieve cost reductions, including, without limitation,
 those which we expect to achieve through any cost reduction and restructuring initiatives, as well as any inability to consummate
 additional strategic alternatives for our business, including, but not limited to, the sale or licensing of our assets, and/or less
 than expected benefits resulting from any such strategic alternative; difficulties, delays or our inability to efficiently manage
 our cash and working capital; higher than expected operating expenses; adverse impacts to our liquidity position resulting from the
 higher interest rate and higher inflationary environment; the unavailability of funds from anticipated borrowing sources; the unavailability
 of funds from our inability to reduce or control costs, including, without limitation, those which we expect to achieve through any
 cost reduction and restructuring initiatives; lower than expected operating revenues, cash on hand and/or funds available from anticipated
 borrowings or funds expected to be generated from cost reductions resulting from the implementation of cost control initiatives,
 such as through any cost reduction and restructuring initiatives; and/or less than anticipated cash generated by our operations;
 and/or adverse effects on our liquidity resulting from changes in economic conditions (such as continued volatility in the financial
 markets, whether attributable to COVID-19, the ongoing wars between Russia and Ukraine and between Israel and Hamas or otherwise;
 significantly higher rates of inflation, significantly higher interest rates and higher labor costs; the impact of higher energy
 prices on consumer purchasing behavior, monetary conditions and foreign currency fluctuations, tariffs, foreign currency controls
 and/or government-mandated pricing controls, as well as in trade, monetary, fiscal and tax policies), political conditions (such
 as military actions and terrorist activities) and pandemics and natural disasters; and/or the unavailability of funds from (A) delaying
 the implementation of or revising certain aspects of our business strategy; (B) reducing or delaying the development and launch of
 new products and events; (C) reducing or delaying capital spending, product development spending and marketing and promotional spending;
 (D) selling assets or operations; (E) seeking additional capital contributions and/or loans from Driven Lifestyle, our other affiliates
 and/or third parties; and/or (F) reducing other discretionary spending; 

iv 

(ii) 
 difficulties,
 delays or less than expected results in achieving our growth plans, objectives and expectations, such as due to a slower than anticipated
 economic recovery and/or our inability, in whole or in part, to continue to execute our business strategies and plans, such as due
 to less than anticipated customer acceptance of our new game titles, our experiencing difficulties or the inability to launch our
 games as planned, less than anticipated performance of the games impacting customer acceptance and sales and/or greater than anticipated
 costs and expenses to develop and launch our games, including, without limitation, higher than expected labor costs; 

(iii) 
 difficulties,
 delays in or unanticipated events that may impact the timing and scope of new product launches, such as due to difficulties and/or
 delays related to our transition from using development staff in Russia to using development staff in other countries and/or difficulties
 and/or delays arising out of any resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic or any other pandemic; 

(iv) 
 less
 than expected benefits from implementing our management strategies and/or adverse economic, market and geopolitical conditions that
 negatively impact industry trends, such as significant changes in the labor markets, an extended or higher than expected inflationary
 environment (such as the impact on consumer discretionary spending as a result of significant increases in energy and gas prices
 which have been increasing since early in 2020), a higher interest rate environment, tax increases impacting consumer discretionary
 spending and or quantitative easing that results in higher interest rates that negatively impact consumers discretionary spending,
 or adverse developments relating to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and conflicts in the Middle East; 

(v) 
 difficulties
 and/or delays adversely impacting our ability (or inability) to maintain existing, and to secure additional, licenses and other agreements
 with various racing series; 

(vi) 
 difficulties
 and/or delays adversely impacting our ability to successfully manage and integrate any joint ventures, acquisitions of businesses,
 solutions or technologies; 

(vii) 
 unanticipated
 operating costs, transaction costs and actual or contingent liabilities; 

(viii) 
 difficulties
 and/or delays adversely impacting our ability to attract and retain qualified employees and key personnel; 

(ix) 
 adverse
 effects of increased competition; 

(x) 
 changes
 in consumer behavior, including as a result of general economic factors, such as increased inflation, recessionary factors, higher
 energy prices and higher interest rates; 

(xi) 
 difficulties
 and/or delays adversely impacting our ability to protect our intellectual property; 

(xii) 
 local,
 industry and general business and economic conditions; 

(xiii) 
 unanticipated
 adverse effects on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or liquidity as a result of
 unexpected developments with respect to our legal proceedings; 

(xiv) 
 difficulties,
 delays or our inability to successfully complete any cost reduction and restructuring initiatives, which could reduce the benefits
 realized from such activities; 

(xv) 
 higher
 than anticipated restructuring charges and/or payments and/or changes in the expected timing of such charges and/or payments as a
 result of, among other things, legal requirements in applicable foreign jurisdictions; and/or less than anticipated annualized cost
 reductions from our plans and/or changes in the timing of realizing such cost reductions, such as due to less than anticipated liquidity
 to fund such activities and/or more than expected costs to achieve the expected cost reductions; 

(xvi) 
 difficulties,
 delays, less than expected results or our inability to successfully implement any strategic alternative or potential option for our
 business, including, but not limited to, the sale or licensing of certain of our assets, which could result in, among other things,
 less than expected financial benefits from such actions; and 

(xvii) 
 difficulties
 and/or delays or unanticipated developments adversely impacting our ability to maintain compliance with the NASDAQ s listing
 requirements, such as our inability to implement equity financing transactions. 

(xviii) 
 unanticipated
 adverse effects arising from our inability to fully repay Luminis International B.V. and Technology In Business B.V., the sellers
 of Studio 397 B.V. Studio397 ), relating to our acquisition of 100 of the share capital of Studio397 in April 2021. 

Additionally,
there are other risks and uncertainties described from time to time in the reports that we file with the SEC. Should one or more of these
risks or uncertainties materialize or should any of these assumptions prove to be incorrect, our actual operating and financial performance
may vary in material respects from the performance projected in these forward-looking statements. Further, any forward-looking statement
speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking
statement contained in this Report to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence
of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances, except as otherwise required by law. New factors that could cause our business
not to develop as we expect emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. Further, we cannot assess
the impact of each currently known or new factor on our results of operations or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors,
may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

million and negative cash flows from operations of million for the nine months ended September 30,
2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of million and cash and cash equivalents of million,
which decreased to million as of October 31, 2024. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company experienced an average net cash burn from operations of approximately million
per month, and while it has taken, and continues to take, measures to reduce its costs, the Company expects to continue to have a net
cash outflow from operations for the foreseeable future as it continues to develop its product portfolio and invest in developing new
video game titles. 

The
Company s future liquidity and capital requirements include funds to support the planned costs to operate its business, including
amounts required to fund working capital, support the development and introduction of new products, maintain existing titles, and certain
capital expenditures. 

In
order to address its liquidity shortfall, the Company continues to explore several options, including, but not limited to: i) additional
funding in the form of potential equity and/or debt financing arrangements or similar transactions (collectively, Capital Financing 
ii) other strategic alternatives for its business, including, but not limited to, the sale or licensing of the Company s assets
in addition to the recent sales of its NASCAR License (as defined below) and Traxion, which was the Company s motorsport and racing
games community content platform; and iii) cost reduction and restructuring initiatives, each of which is described more fully below. 

On
October 3, 2024, the Company implemented additional measures to continue to bring down its year-over-year
operating expense through a reduction of the Company s workforce primarily in the United States and the United Kingdom by
approximately 23 employees and contractors. The workforce reduction impacted approximately 23 individuals or 38 of the
Company s employees worldwide. The Company recorded a restructuring charge related to the workforce reduction, primarily
consisting of severance and redundancy costs of approximately 
million. The Company expects to recognize and pay out the majority of the restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal year
2024. 

On
July 29, 2024, the Company closed on a registered direct offering transaction with H.C. Wainwright Co., LLC acting as the exclusive
placement agent, which raised million in gross proceeds before deducting the placement agent s fees and other offering expenses.
The Company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for working capital and general corporate purposes. 

On
March 31, 2023, the Company entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the ED Agreement with Canaccord Genuity LLC,
as sales agent (the Sales Agent ), pursuant to which the Company may issue and sell shares of its Class A common stock having
an aggregate gross offering price of up to million (subject to compliance with the limitations set forth in the SEC s baby
shelf rules). Subject to the terms and conditions of the ED Agreement, the Sales Agent may sell shares by any method deemed to
be an at-the-market ATM offering as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
 Securities Act ). At the time the Company filed an initial prospectus supplement in connection with the offering of its
shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the ED Agreement, the aggregate market value of the shares of Class A common stock eligible
for sale under the initial prospectus supplement was approximately million, which was based on the limitations of such offerings
under SEC Regulations. No sales were made pursuant to the ED Agreement during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. On July 26, 2024,
the Company filed a prospectus supplement terminating the continuous offering, although the ED Agreement remains in effect. However,
due to the Company s present liquidity position and required future funding requirements, even if the Company filed another prospectus
supplement to reinstate the continuous offering pursuant to the ED Agreement and raised the maximum amount available for future sales
via its ATM program, such proceeds would not be sufficient to satisfy its ongoing liquidity requirements and further potential Capital
Financing would be required, in conjunction to the other options being explored by the Company. Further, there can be no assurance the
Company will be able to obtain funds via its ATM program, should it choose to sell shares under the ED Agreement, nor can there be any
other assurance that the Company can secure additional funding in the form of equity and/or debt financing on commercially acceptable
terms, if at all, to satisfy its future needed liquidity and capital resources. 

Motorsport
Games Inc. and Subsidiaries 
Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

Due
to the continuing uncertainty surrounding the Company s ability to raise funding in the form of potential Capital Financing, and
in light of its liquidity position and anticipated future funding requirements, the Company continues to explore other strategic alternatives
and potential options for its business, including, but not limited to, the sale or licensing of certain of the Company s assets
in addition to the recent sales of its NASCAR License and Traxion. 

If
any such additional strategic alternative is executed, it is expected it would help to improve the Company s working capital position
and reduce overhead expenditures, thereby lowering the Company s expected future cash-burn, and providing some short-term liquidity
relief. Nonetheless, even if the Company is successful in implementing one or more additional strategic alternatives, the Company will
continue to require additional funding and/or further cost reduction measures in order to continue operations, which includes further
restructuring of its business and operations. There are no assurances that the Company will be successful in implementing any additional
strategic plans for the sale or licensing of its assets, or any other strategic alternative, which may be subject to the satisfaction
of conditions beyond the Company s control. 

As
the Company continues to address its liquidity constraints, the Company may need to make further adjustments to its product roadmap in
order to reduce operating cash burn. Additionally, the Company continues to seek to improve its liquidity through maintaining and enhancing
cost control initiatives. The Company plans to continue evaluating the structure of its business for additional changes in order to improve
both its near-term and long-term liquidity position, as well as create a healthy and sustainable company from which to operate. 

There
can be no assurance that the Company would be able to take any of the financing actions referred to above because of a variety of commercial
or market factors, including, without limitation, market conditions being unfavorable for an equity or debt issuance or similar transactions,
loans not being available from third parties, or that the transactions may not be permitted under the terms of the Company s various
debt instruments then in effect, such as due to restrictions on the incurrence of debt, incurrence of liens, asset dispositions and related
party transactions. In addition, such actions, if taken, may not enable the Company to satisfy its capital requirements if the actions
that the Company is able to consummate do not generate a sufficient amount of additional capital. 

Even
if the Company does secure additional Capital Financing, if the anticipated level of revenues are not achieved because of, for example,
decreased sales of the Company s products due to the disposition of key assets, such as the sale of its NASCAR License and/or the
Company s inability to deliver new products for its various other licenses; less than anticipated consumer acceptance of the Company s
offering of products and events; less than effective marketing and promotion campaigns, decreased consumer spending in response to weak
economic conditions or weakness in the overall electronic games category; adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates; decreased
sales of the Company s products and events as a result of increased competitive activities by the Company s competitors;
changes in consumer purchasing habits, such as the impact of higher energy prices on consumer purchasing behavior; retailer inventory
management or reductions in retailer display space; less than anticipated results from the Company s existing or new products or
from its advertising and/or marketing plans; or if the Company s expenses, including, without limitation, for marketing, advertising
and promotions, product returns or price protection expenditures, exceed the anticipated level of expenses, the Company s liquidity
position may continue to be insufficient to satisfy its future capital requirements. If the Company is ultimately unable to satisfy its
capital requirements, it would likely need to dissolve and liquidate its assets under the bankruptcy laws or otherwise. 

Motorsport
Games Inc. and Subsidiaries 
Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

If
the Company is unable to satisfy its capital requirements, it could be required to adopt one or more of the following alternatives: 

delaying
 the implementation of or revising certain aspects of the Company s business strategy; 

further
 reducing or delaying the development and launch of new products and events; 

further
 reducing or delaying capital spending, product development spending and marketing and promotional spending; 

selling
 additional assets or operations; 

seeking
 additional loans from third parties; 

further
 reducing other discretionary spending; 

entering
 into financing agreements on unattractive terms; and/or 

significantly
 curtailing or discontinuing operations. 

In
accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC 205-40, Going Concern , the Company has evaluated whether
there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern within one year after the date that the condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. The factors described
above, in particular the lack of available cash on hand to fund operations over the next year, have raised substantial doubt about the
Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome
of this uncertainty. Accordingly, the condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis that assumes the Company
will continue as a going concern and which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in
the ordinary course of business.

Motorsport
Games Inc. and Subsidiaries 
Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

Since
the Company does not sell the performance obligations on a stand-alone basis, the Company considers market conditions and other observable
inputs to estimate the stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation. For Games with Services, generally 75 percent of the
sales price is allocated to the software license performance obligation and recognized at a point in time when control of the license
has been transferred to the customer. The remaining 25 percent is allocated to the future update rights and the online hosting performance
obligations and recognized ratably as the service is provided (over the Estimated Offering Period). 

Extra
Content. Revenue received from sales of downloadable content are derived primarily from the sale of digital in-game content that
are designed to extend and enhance players game experience. Sales of extra content are accounted for in a manner consistent with
the treatment for the Company s Games with Services as discussed above, depending upon whether or not the extra content has offline
functionality. That is, if the extra content has offline functionality, then the extra content is accounted for similarly to Games with
Services (generally determined to have three distinct performance obligations: software license, future update rights, and the online
hosting). If the extra content does not have offline functionality, then the extra content is determined to have one distinct performance
obligation: the online-hosted service. 

Significant
Judgments around Revenue Arrangements 

Identifying
performance obligations. Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods and services that will
be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, (i.e., the customer can benefit from the goods or services either
on its own or together with other resources that are readily available), and are distinct in the context of the contract (i.e., it is
separately identifiable from other goods or services in the contract). To the extent a contract includes multiple promises, the Company
must apply judgment to determine whether those promises are separate and distinct performance obligations. If these criteria are not
met, the promises are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. 

Determining
the transaction price. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration that the Company will be entitled to receive
in exchange for transferring its goods and services to the customer. Determining the transaction price often requires judgment, based
on an assessment of contractual terms and business practices. It further includes review of variable consideration such as discounts,
sales returns, price protection, and rebates, which is estimated at the time of the transaction. In addition, the transaction price does
not include an estimate of the variable consideration related to sales-based royalties. Sales-based royalties are recognized as the sales
occur. 

Allocating
the transaction price. Allocating the transaction price requires that the Company determine an estimate of the relative stand-alone
selling price for each distinct performance obligation. Determining the relative stand-alone selling price is inherently subjective,
especially in situations where the Company does not sell the performance obligation on a stand-alone basis (which occurs in the majority
of transactions). In those situations, the Company determines the relative stand-alone selling price based on various observable inputs
using all information that is reasonably available. Examples of observable inputs and information include historical internal pricing
data and pricing data from competitors, to the extent the data is available. The results of the Company s analysis resulted in
a specific percentage of the transaction price being allocated to each performance obligation. 

Determining
the Estimated Offering Period. The offering period is the period in which the Company offers to provide the future update rights
and/or online hosting for the game and related extra content sold. Because the offering period is not an explicitly defined period, the
Company must make an estimate of the offering period for the service-related performance obligations (i.e., future update rights and
online hosting). Determining the Estimated Offering Period is inherently subjective and is subject to regular revision. Generally, the
Company considers the average period of time customers are online when estimating the offering period. The Company recognizes revenue
for future update rights and online hosting performance obligations ratably on a straight-line basis over this period as there is a consistent
pattern of delivery for these performance obligations. Revenue for service-related performance obligations for digitally-distributed
games and extra content is recognized over an estimated seven-month period beginning in the month of sale.

The
Company utilized a Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model to determine the fair value of the Wainwright Warrants. The Black-Scholes model
requires management to make a number of key assumptions, including expected volatility, expected term, and risk-free interest rate. The
risk-free interest rate is estimated using the rate of return on U.S. treasury notes with a life that approximates the expected term.
The expected term assumption used in the Black-Scholes model represents the period of time that the Wainwright Warrants are expected
to be outstanding and is estimated using the contractual term of the Wainwright Warrants.

Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

Certain
conditions may exist as of the date the condensed consolidated financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company,
but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses such contingent liabilities,
and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are
pending against the Company, or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company evaluates the perceived merits of
any legal proceedings or unasserted claims, as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein. 

If
the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability
can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. If
the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot
be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable and material,
would be disclosed. The Company recognizes legal costs associated with loss contingencies in the period incurred. 

Loss
contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed, unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed.
There can be no assurance that such matters will not materially and adversely affect the Company s business, financial position,
and results of operations or cash flows. 

On
February 11, 2021, HC2 Holdings 2 Inc. (now known as Innovate 2) Innovate and Continental General Insurance Company Continental ),
former minority stockholders of 704Games, filed a complaint (the HC2 and Continental Complaint in the U.S. District Court
for the District of Delaware against the Company, the Company s former Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman, the Company s
former Chief Financial Officer, and the manager of Driven Lifestyle. The complaint was later amended and added Leo Capital Holdings LLC Leo Capital as an additional plaintiff and the controller of Driven Lifestyle as an additional individual defendant.
The complaint alleges, among other things, purported misrepresentations and omissions concerning 704Games financial condition
made in connection with the Company s purchase of these minority shareholders interest in 704Games in August and October
2020. The complaint asserts claims under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act; Section 20A of the Exchange Act; breach of the Company s obligations
under the Stockholders Agreement dated August 14, 2018; fraudulent inducement; breach of fiduciary duties; and unjust enrichment.
The plaintiffs alleged, among other things, damages from the defendants, jointly and severally, based on the alleged difference between
the fair market value of the shares of common stock of 704Games on the date of plaintiffs sale and the purchase price that was
paid, as well as punitive damages and other relief. In May 2021, the Company, along with the other defendants, filed a motion to dismiss
the plaintiffs complaint. On March 28, 2022, the court entered an order denying the motion to dismiss. 

On
January 11, 2023, in connection with the HC2 and Continental Complaint, the Company, along with other defendants, entered into a settlement
agreement with one of the plaintiffs, Continental, to settle the claims made by Continental against the defendants and the claims made

to Continental. The Company paid an initial payment of approximately million on January 17, 2023, and was obligated to make payments
of no less than approximately every 30 days after the initial payment date until the settlement amount of million was paid
in full. As of September 30, 2024, all required payments under the settlement agreement with Continental have been made. 

On
October 14, 2023, the Company, along with other defendants, reached and executed a settlement agreement with Leo Capital in connection
with the HC2 and Continental Complaint, which settles the claims made by Leo Capital against the defendants, as well as the claims made
by the defendants against Leo Capital. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, the Company agreed to pay the sum of million
to Leo Capital. The Company paid the full million settlement on October 16, 2023, as required by terms of the settlement agreement.

In
respect of Innovate, the Company believes that the plaintiff s allegations are without merit and the Company intends to continue
to vigorously defend its position to the fullest extent permitted by law. Given the litigation is ongoing, the outcome of the litigation
remains uncertain at this time. As such, the Company does not believe it is probable a settlement will be reached, nor can any such settlement
amount be reasonably estimable, and has not recognized a settlement liability in respect of the remaining plaintiff. 

On
July 28, 2023, Wesco Insurance Company Wesco filed a complaint in state court in Florida against the Company, as well
as the other defendants involved in the litigation related to the HC2 and Continental Complaint (the Underlying Action ).
The Company had previously submitted the Underlying Action for coverage under a management liability policy issued by Hallmark Specialty
Insurance Company Hallmark and an excess policy with Wesco (the Wesco Policy ). Wesco s complaint
seeks declaratory relief to determine Wesco s obligations to the defendants under an excess policy of insurance issued to the Company
by Wesco for the Underlying Action. Wesco claims that there is no coverage afforded to the defendants for the Underlying Action under
the Wesco Policy. The Company disagrees with and disputes Wesco s position regarding coverage for the Underlying Action under the
Wesco Policy and plans to defend its position. 

On
November 22, 2023, the Company entered into an insurance policy and claims release with Hallmark (the Hallmark Settlement related to a previously submitted Underlying Action for coverage under a management liability policy issued by Hallmark. Under the terms

reportable segments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were (i) the development and publishing of interactive
racing video games, entertainment content and services (the Gaming segment and (ii) the organization and facilitation
of esports tournaments, competitions and events for the Company s licensed racing games as well as on behalf of third-party video
game racing series and other video game publishers (the esports segment ). The Company s Chief Operating Decision
Maker CODM has been identified as the Company s Chief Executive Officer, who reviews operating results to make
decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. Segment information is presented based upon the
Company s management organization structure as of September 30, 2024 and the distinctive nature of each segment. Future changes
to this internal financial structure may result in changes to the reportable segments disclosed. There are no inter-segment revenue transactions
and, therefore, revenues are only to external customers. As the Company primarily generates its revenues from customers in the United
States, no geographical segments are presented. 

Segment
operating profit is determined based upon internal performance measures used by the CODM. The Company derives the segment results from
its internal management reporting system. The accounting policies the Company uses to derive reportable segment results are the same
as those used for external reporting purposes. Management measures the performance of each reportable segment based upon several metrics,
including net revenues, gross profit and operating loss. Management uses these results to evaluate the performance of, and to assign
resources to, each of the reportable segments. The Company manages certain operating expenses separately at the corporate level and does
not allocate such expenses to the segments. Segment income from operations excludes interest income/expense and other income or expenses
and income taxes according to how a particular reportable segment s management is measured. Management does not consider impairment
charges, and unallocated costs in measuring the performance of the reportable segments.

About
Motorsport Games 

Motorsport
Games is a racing game developer, publisher and esports ecosystem provider of official motorsport racing series, including the
iconic 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance race Le Mans and the associated FIA World Endurance Championship (the
 WEC ). Our portfolio also includes the KartKraft karting simulation game, as well as Studio 397 B.V. Studio397 and their rFactor 2 realistic racing simulator technology and platform. rFactor 2 also powers F1 
Arcade through a partnership with Kindred Concepts. Our purpose is to make the thrill of motorsports accessible to everyone by
creating the highest quality, most sophisticated and innovative experiences for racers, gamers and fans of all ages. Our products
and services target a large global motorsport audience. 

We
develop and publish multi-platform racing video games including for game consoles, personal computers (PCs) and mobile platforms through
various retail and digital channels, including full-game and downloadable content DLC ). We have obtained the official
licenses to develop multi-platform games for the 24 Hours of Le Mans race and the WEC. We are also striving to become a leader in organizing
and facilitating esports tournaments, competitions, and events for our licensed racing games. 

On
October 3, 2023, we sold our NASCAR licensed rights under that certain Second Amended and Restated Distribution and License Agreement
with NASCAR Team Properties NTP (the NASCAR License to iRacing.com Motorsport Simulations, LLC. Prior
to the sale of our NASCAR License, we had been the official video game developer and publisher for the NASCAR video game racing franchise
and had the exclusive right to create and organize esports leagues and events for NASCAR using our NASCAR racing video games, in each
case, subject to certain limited exceptions. Concurrently with the sale of our NASCAR License, we entered into an agreement with NTP
pursuant to which we have a limited non-exclusive right and license to, among other things, sell our NASCAR games and DLCs that are currently
in our product portfolio through December 31, 2024 (the NASCAR New Limited License ). For the three months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, 55.6 and 77.9 of our total revenue, respectively, was generated from sales of our NASCAR racing video games.

Due
to the uncertainty surrounding our ability to raise funding, and in light of our liquidity position and anticipated future funding requirements,
we continue to explore other strategic alternatives and potential options for our business, including, but not limited to, the sale or
licensing of certain of our assets in addition to the recent sales of our NASCAR License and Traxion, which was our motorsport and racing
games community content platform. If any such additional strategic alternative is executed, it is expected it would help to improve our
working capital position and reduce overhead expenditures, thereby lowering our expected future cash-burn, and provide some short-term
liquidity relief. Nonetheless, even if we are successful in implementing one or more additional strategic alternatives, we will continue
to require additional funding and/or further cost reduction measures in order to continue operations, which includes further restructuring
of our business and operations. There are no assurances that we will be successful in implementing any additional strategic plans for
the sale or licensing of our assets, or any other strategic alternative, which may be subject to the satisfaction of conditions beyond
our control.

25 

We
continually evaluate our planned product release schedule and modify the timing of upcoming products based on developments in our business,
or if we believe it will result in a better consumer experience. The sale of our NASCAR License and the termination of our BTCC License
and INDYCAR License, as disclosed elsewhere in this Report, has impacted our long-term product release schedule as we will no longer
be producing NASCAR, BTCC and INDYCAR titles moving forward. 

As
we continue to evaluate the cost saving initiatives and explore other strategic alternatives and potential options for our business,
including, but not limited to, the sale or licensing of certain of our assets, further adjustments to our product roadmap may be required. 

Hardware
Platforms 

We
derive most of our revenue from the sale of products made for PCs and video game consoles manufactured by third parties, such as Sony
Interactive Entertainment Inc. s Sony PlayStation and Microsoft Corporation s Microsoft Xbox
consoles, which comprised approximately 50.6 and 66.1 of our total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the sale of products for Microsoft Windows via Steam comprised approximately 47.1 
and 22.4 of our total revenue, respectively, and the sale of products for mobile platforms comprised approximately 2.0 and 4.9 of
our total revenue, respectively. The success of our business is dependent upon consumer acceptance of video game console/PC platforms
and continued growth in the installed base of these platforms. When new hardware platforms are introduced, such as those released by
Sony and Microsoft in November 2020, demand for interactive entertainment used on older platforms typically declines, which may negatively
affect our business during the market transition to the new consoles. The latest generation of Sony and Microsoft consoles provide backwards
compatibility (i.e., the ability to play games for the previous generation of consoles), which could mitigate the risk of such
a decline. However, we cannot be certain how backwards compatibility will affect demand for our products. 

Digital
Business 

Players
increasingly purchase our games as digital downloads, as opposed to purchasing physical discs. All of our titles that are available through
retailers as packaged goods products are also available through direct digital download. For each of the nine months ended September
30, 2024, and 2023, approximately 86.8 and 86.9 of our revenue from sales of video games for game consoles and PCs was through digital
channels. We believe this trend of increasing direct digital downloads is primarily due to benefits relating to convenience and accessibility
that digital downloads provide. In addition, as part of our digital business strategy, we aim to drive ongoing engagement and incremental
revenue from recurrent consumer spending on our titles through in-game purchases and extra content. 

Esports 

We
are striving to become a leader in organizing and facilitating esports tournaments, competitions, and events for our licensed racing
games as well as on behalf of third-party racing game developers and publishers. In 2023, we organized the
grand finale of the Le Mans Virtual Series 2022/23, the 24 Hours of Le Mans Virtual event, which had a cumulative total of approximately
8.8 million video views with approximately 27 million minutes watched. The 24 Hours of Le Mans Virtual event had a global audience of
5 million across television (TV)/over-the-top (OTT) channels. Although we did not organize the Le Mans Virtual Series for the 2023/24
season, we currently plan on organizing the 2024/25 Le Mans Virtual Series to commence later this year. We also intend to continue exploring
opportunities to expand the recurring portion of our esports segment outside of Le Mans. 

Recurring
Revenue Sources 

Our
business model includes revenue that we deem recurring in nature, which historically consisted primarily of revenue from our annualized
NASCAR video game racing franchise for game consoles, PC, and mobile platforms. We historically have been able to forecast the revenue
from this area of our business with greater relative confidence than for new games, services, and business models. Following the sale
of our NASCAR License and as we continue to incorporate new business models and modalities of play into our games, our goal is to continue
to look for opportunities to expand the recurring portion of our business, including through the planned introduction of new annualized
sports franchise games, such as with Le Mans. 

Reportable
Segments 

We
use the management approach in determining reportable operating segments. The management approach considers the internal
organization and reporting used by our chief operating decision maker for making operating decisions and assessing performance as the
source for determining our reportable segments. Our chief operating decision maker is our Chief Executive Officer, who reviews operating
results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire company. We classified our reportable operating
segments into (i) the development and publishing of interactive racing video games, entertainment content and services (the Gaming
segment and (ii) the organization and facilitation of esports tournaments, competitions and events for our licensed racing games
as well as on behalf of third-party video game racing series and other video game publishers (the esports segment ). 

Components
of Our Results of Operations 

Revenues 

We
have historically derived substantially all of our revenue from sales of our games and related extra content that can be played by customers
on a variety of platforms, including game consoles, mobile phones, PCs and tablets. Starting in 2019, we began generating sponsorship
revenues from our production of live and virtual esports events. In early 2022, we also began offering software development services
for racing simulators.

Our
product and service offerings included within the Gaming segment primarily include, but are not limited to, full PC, console, and mobile
games with both online and offline functionality, which generally include:

 content; 

updates
 to previously released games on a when-and-if-available basis, such as software patches or updates, and/or additional content to
 be delivered in the future, both paid and free; and

We
did not organize a Le Mans Virtual Series LMVS event in Q3 2024 or Q3 2023, resulting in no earned sponsorship or events

compared to the prior period.

in our Gaming segment gross profit of 0.2 million, and corresponding increase in gross profit
margin, was primarily due to higher gaming revenues, particularly related to increased digital game revenues as a result of sales
of Le Mans Ultimate released on PC in February 2024. The increase in gross profit for the Gaming segment was also attributable to lower
cost of revenues due to decreased royalty payments resulting from the decrease in NASCAR game sales compared to the prior period. 

As

Changes
in operating expenses are explained in more detail below: 

Sales
and Marketing 

Sales
and marketing expenses were 0.6 million and 1.4 million for 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing a 0.8 million, or 55.3 decrease
when compared to the prior period. The reduction in sales and marketing expense was primarily driven by a 0.7 million reduction in payroll
and employee-related expenses as a result of lower headcount, and a 0.1 million decrease in software and travel expenses, when compared
to the prior period. 

Development 

Development
expenses were 2.8 million and 5.8 million for 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing a 3.0 million, or 51.7 , decrease when compared
to the prior period. The reduction in development expense was primarily driven by a 2.0 million reduction in payroll and employee-related
expenses expense as a result of lower headcount, as well as a decrease in 1.0 million in external development, when compared to the
prior period. 

32 

General
and Administrative 

G A
expenses were 5.5 million and 7 .5 million for
2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of 1.9 million, or 25.6 , when compared to the prior period. The reduction in G A
expense was primarily driven by a 1.3 million reduction in payroll and employee-related expenses due to lower headcount period over
period, a 0.5 million reduction in severance and insurance costs, respectively, as well as a 0.2 million 
reduction in rent and office expense. This was partially offset by a 0.6 million increase in legal and professional
fees. 

Impairment
of Intangible Assets 

Impairment
of finite-lived intangible assets was 0 million and 4.0 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The trigger for the impairment in 2023
was our decision to explore strategic alternatives and potential options for our business, resulting in a probable likelihood of the
sale of certain licensing rights that would result in our inability to comply with the terms of a licensing agreement by the end of the
year and the resulting reduction in expected future revenues. 

Depreciation
and Amortization 

Depreciation
and amortization expenses for 2024 and 2023 presented no significant changes to the depreciation of capital assets. 

Gain
from Settlement of License Liabilities 

Gain
from settlement of license liabilities of 3.2 million for 2024 is primarily comprised of a 2.5 million gain stemming from a Settlement
and License Agreement with INDYCAR LLC executed on May 17, 2024 and a gain of 0.6 million related to the Settlement Agreement with BARC
(TOCA) LIMITED, the exclusive promoter of the British Touring Car Championship on April 12, 2024. 

Other
Operating Income 

Other
operating income was 0.3 million for 2024, compared to 0 million for 2023, an increase of 0.3 million compared to the prior period.
Other operating income of 0.3 million for 2024 relates to the gain from the sale of Traxion, which was our motorsport and racing games
community content platform, in April 2024. 

Interest
Expense 

Interest
expense was 0.1 million and 0.7 million for 2024 and 2023 primarily from non-cash interest
accretion of our INDYCAR and BTCC license liabilities, which were both fully settled in Q2 2024. 

Other
Income, net 

Other
income, net was 1.0 million for 2024, compared to 0.4 million for 2023, an increase of 0.6 million compared to the prior period. Other
income, net of 1.0 million for 2024 was primarily comprised of 0.9 million in foreign currency gains arising from remeasuring transactions
denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars and 0.1 million in rental income. 

Other
Comprehensive Income (Loss) 

Other
comprehensive loss was 0.6 million for 2024, compared to other comprehensive income of 0.2 million in 2023. The 0.8 million increase
in other comprehensive loss was primarily due to activity in our U.K. and Netherlands subsidiaries, and represents unrealized foreign
currency translation adjustments. 

Net
(Loss) Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interest 

Net
(loss) income attributable to non-controlling interest was (1.3) million for 2024 compared to 0.1 million in 2023. The variance was
attributed to an increase in net losses in the Le Mans Esports Series Ltd joint venture. 

33 

Non-GAAP
Financial Measures 

Adjusted
EBITDA 

Adjusted
EBITDA, a measure used by management to assess our operating performance, is defined as EBITDA, which is net loss plus interest expense,
depreciation and amortization, less income tax benefit (if any), adjusted to exclude: (i) gain from
settlement of license liabilities (ii) impairment of intangible assets; (iii) loss contingency expense and (iv) stock-based compensation
expenses. 

Adjusted
EBITDA (the Non-GAAP Measure is not a financial measure defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles U.S.
GAAP ). Reconciliations of the Non-GAAP Measure to net loss, its most directly comparable financial measure, calculated and presented
in accordance with U.S. GAAP, are presented in the tables below. We use the Non-GAAP Measure to manage our business and evaluate our
financial performance, as Adjusted EBITDA eliminates items that affect comparability between periods that we believe are not representative
of our core ongoing operating business. Additionally, we believe that using the Non-GAAP Measure is useful to our investors because it
enhances investors understanding and assessment of our normalized operating performance and facilitates comparisons to prior periods
and our competitors results (who may define Adjusted EBITDA differently). 

The
Non-GAAP Measure is not a recognized term under U.S. GAAP and does not purport to be an alternative to revenue, income/loss from operations,
net loss income, or cash flows from operations or as a measure of liquidity or any other performance measure derived in accordance with
U.S. GAAP. Additionally, the Non-GAAP Measure is not intended to be a measure of free cash flows available for our discretionary use,
as it does not consider certain cash requirements, such as interest payments, tax payments, working capital requirements and debt service
requirements. The Non-GAAP Measure has limitations as an analytical tool, and investors should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute
for our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Management compensates for the limitations of using the Non-GAAP Measure by using it to
supplement U.S. GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business than would be
presented by using only measures in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, the Non-GAAP Measure
may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a net loss of 0.2 million and negative cash flows from operations of 0.7
million. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 86.3 million and cash and cash equivalents of 0.8 million,
which decreased to 0.5 million as of October 31, 2024. We do not believe that our current capital resources will be sufficient to
fund our operations over the next year. Based on our current expected level of operating expenditures and cash and cash equivalents
on hand, management concludes that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at
least 12 months subsequent to the issuance of the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Historically,
we have financed our operations primarily through revenue generated from operations, loans and sales of our securities, and we
expect to continue to seek and obtain additional capital in a similar manner. Management is actively pursuing financing and other
strategic plans, however, we do not have any committed sources of financing at this time, and it is uncertain whether any additional
funding will be available when we need it on terms that will be acceptable to us, or at all. There can be no assurance that we will
be able to raise funds by selling additional securities, which sales, if successful, could dilute the ownership interest of our
existing shareholders. The issuance of debt can result in restrictive covenants that limit operations. If funding is not available
or not available at terms acceptable to us, we will seek to further reduce overhead costs and our cash obligations in the short
term, as needed. In addition, we may look to divest or bring in equity partners for our various divisions and bring in near term
capital. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we experienced an average net cash burn from operations of approximately 0.1 million per month,
and while we have taken measures to reduce our costs, we expect to continue to have a net cash outflow from operations for the foreseeable
future as we continue to develop our product portfolio and invest in developing new video game titles. Based on our cash and cash equivalents
position and our average cash burn, we do not believe we have sufficient cash on hand to fund our operations over the next year and that
additional funding will be required in order to continue operations. 

Our
future liquidity and capital requirements include funds to support the planned costs to operate our business, including amounts required
to fund working capital, support the development and introduction of new products, maintain existing titles, and certain capital expenditures. 

In
order to address our liquidity shortfall, we continue to explore several options, including, but not limited to: i) additional funding
in the form of potential equity and/or debt financing arrangements or similar transactions (collectively, Capital Financing 
ii) other strategic alternatives for our business, including, but not limited to, the sale or licensing of our assets in addition to
the recent sales of our NASCAR License and Traxion; and iii) cost reduction and restructuring initiatives, each of which is described
more fully below. 

On
October 3, 2024, we implemented additional measures to continue to bring down our year-over-year operating expense through
a reduction of our workforce primarily in the United States and the United Kingdom by approximately 23 employees and contractors. The
workforce reduction is expected to impact approximately 38 of total employees worldwide. We recorded a restructuring charge related
to the workforce reduction, primarily consisting of severance and redundancy costs of approximately 0.2 million. We expect to recognize
and pay out the majority of the restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024. 

On
July 29, 2024, we closed on a registered direct offering transaction with H.C. Wainwright Co., LLC acting as the exclusive placement
agent, which raised 1.0 million in gross proceeds before deducting the placement agent s fees and other offering expenses. We intend
to use the net proceeds from this offering for working capital and general corporate purposes. 

In
March 2023, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the ED Agreement with Canaccord Genuity LLC, as sales agent
(the Sales Agent ), pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of its Class A common stock having an aggregate offering
price of up to 10 million (subject to compliance with the limitations set forth in the SEC s baby shelf rules).
Subject to the terms and conditions of the ED Agreement, the Sales Agent may sell shares by any method deemed to be an at-the-market ATM offering as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. During the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2024, we did not sell any shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the terms of the ED Agreement. At the time we filed
an initial prospectus supplement in connection with the offering of our shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the ED Agreement,
the aggregate market value of the shares of Class A common stock eligible for sale under the initial prospectus supplement was approximately
 2.9 million, which was based on the limitations of such offerings under SEC Regulations. On July 26, 2024, we filed a prospectus supplement
terminating the continuous offering, although the ED Agreement remains in effect. However, due to our present liquidity position and
required future funding requirements, even if we filed another prospectus supplement to reinstate the continuous offering pursuant to
the ED Agreement and raised the maximum amount available for future sales via our ATM program, such proceeds would not be sufficient
to satisfy our ongoing liquidity requirements and further potential Capital Financing would be required, in conjunction to the other
options we are exploring. Further, there can be no assurance we will be able to obtain funds via our ATM program, should we choose to
sell shares under the ED Agreement, nor can there be any other assurance that we can secure additional funding in the form of equity
and/or debt financing on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, to satisfy our future needed liquidity and capital resources. 

Due
to the continuing uncertainty surrounding our ability to raise funding in the form of potential Capital Financing, and in light of our
liquidity position and anticipated future funding requirements, we continue to explore other strategic alternatives and potential options
for our business, including, but not limited to, the sale or licensing of certain of our assets in addition to the recent sales of our
NASCAR License and Traxion. If any such additional strategic alternative is executed, it is expected it would help to improve our working
capital position and reduce overhead expenditures, thereby lowering our expected future cash-burn, and provide some short-term liquidity
relief. Nonetheless, even if we are successful in implementing one or more additional strategic alternatives, we will continue to require
additional funding and/or further cost reduction measures in order to continue operations, which includes further restructuring of our
business and operations. There are no assurances that we will be successful in implementing any additional strategic plans for the sale
or licensing of our assets, or any other strategic alternative, which may be subject to the satisfaction of conditions beyond our control. 

35 

As
we continue to address our liquidity constraints, we may need to make further adjustments to our product roadmap in order to reduce operating
cash burn. Additionally, we continue to seek to improve our liquidity through maintaining and enhancing cost control initiatives. We
plan to continue evaluating the structure of our business for additional changes in order to improve both our near-term and long-term
liquidity position, as well as create a healthy and sustainable company from which to operate. 

If
we are unable to satisfy our capital requirements, we could be required to adopt one or more of the following alternatives: 

delaying
 the implementation of or revising certain aspects of our business strategy; 

further
 reducing or delaying the development and launch of new products and events; 

further
 reducing or delaying capital spending, product development spending and marketing and promotional spending; 

selling
 additional assets or operations; 

seeking
 additional loans from third parties; 

further
 reducing other discretionary spending; 

entering
 into financing agreements on unattractive terms; and/or 

significantly
 curtailing or discontinuing operations or dissolving and liquidating our assets under the bankruptcy laws or otherwise. 

There
can be no assurance that we would be able to take any of the actions referred to above because of a variety of commercial or market factors,
including, without limitation, market conditions being unfavorable for an equity or debt issuance or similar transactions, additional
loans not being available from third parties, or that the transactions may not be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments
then in effect, such as due to restrictions on the incurrence of debt, incurrence of liens, asset dispositions and related party transactions.
In addition, such actions, if taken, may not enable us to satisfy our capital requirements if the actions that we are able to consummate
do not generate a sufficient amount of additional capital. 

Even
if we do secure additional Capital Financing, if the anticipated level of revenues are not achieved because of, for example, decreased
sales of our products due to the disposition of key assets, such as the sale of our NASCAR License, further changes our product roadmap
and/or our inability to deliver new products for our various other licenses; less than anticipated consumer acceptance of our offering
of products and events; less than effective marketing and promotion campaigns, decreased consumer spending in response to weak economic
conditions or weakness in the overall electronic games category; adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates; decreased sales
of our products and events as a result of increased competitive activities by our competitors; changes in consumer purchasing habits,
such as the impact of higher energy prices on consumer purchasing behavior; retailer inventory management or reductions in retailer display
space; less than anticipated results from our existing or new products or from our advertising and/or marketing plans; or if our expenses,
including, without limitation, for marketing, advertising and promotions, product returns or price protection expenditures, exceed the
anticipated level of expenses, our liquidity position may continue to be insufficient to satisfy our future capital requirements. If
we are ultimately unable to satisfy our capital requirements, we would likely need to dissolve and liquidate our assets under the bankruptcy
laws or otherwise. 

In
accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC 205-40, Going Concern , we have evaluated whether there are
conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within
one year after the date that the accompanying consolidated financial statements to this Report are issued. The factors described above,
in particular the lack of available cash on hand to fund operations over the next year, have raised substantial doubt about our ability
to continue as a going concern. 

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Accordingly, the condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis that assumes we will continue as a going concern
and which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business.

Cash
Flows from Operating Activities 

Net
cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 0.7 million and 10.1 million, respectively.
The net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily a result of cash used to fund a
net loss of 0.2 million, adjusted for net non-cash adjustments of 1.3 million and 0.8 million of cash provided by changes in the levels
of operating assets and liabilities. Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily
a result of cash used to fund a net loss of 17.0 million, adjusted for net non-cash adjustments of 6.9 million. 

Cash
Flows from Investing Activities 

Net
cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 0.03 million, which was attributable
to the purchases of property and equipment. 

Cash
Flows from Financing Activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 0.8 million and 10.1 million, respectively.
Cash flows provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily attributable to 0.9 million
raised in connection with shares sold in our registered direct offering, offset by a 0.1 million payment for purchase commitments. Cash
flows provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily attributable to 0.6 million raised
in connection with shares sold under a stock purchase commitment agreement that we entered into on December 9, 2022 with Alumni Capital
LP and 10.4 million raised in connection with shares sold in our registered direct offerings, partially offset by 0.7 million of payments
for purchase commitments and 0.3 million for payments relating to license liabilities. 

Promissory
Note Line of Credit 

On
April 1, 2020, we entered into a promissory note (the 12 million Line of Credit with an affiliated entity, Driven Lifestyle,
that provided us with a line of credit of up to 10 million (which was subsequently increased to 12 million pursuant to an amendment
executed in November 2020) at an interest rate of 10 per annum, the availability of which is dependent on Driven Lifestyle s available
liquidity. The 12 million Line of Credit does not have a stated maturity date and is payable upon demand at any time at the sole and
absolute discretion of Driven Lifestyle, and any principal and accrued interest owed will be accelerated and become immediately payable
in the event we consummate certain corporate events, such as a capital reorganization. We may prepay the 12 million Line of Credit in
whole or in part at any time or from time to time without penalty or charge. Additionally, see Risk Factors Risks Related
to Our Financial Condition and Liquidity - Limits on our borrowing capacity under the 12 million Line of Credit may affect our ability
to finance our operations in Part I, Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K. 

On
September 8, 2022, we entered into a support agreement with Driven Lifestyle (the Support Agreement pursuant to which
Driven Lifestyle issued approximately 3 million (the September 2022 Cash Advance to us in accordance with the 12 million
Line of Credit. Additionally, the Support Agreement modified the 12 million Line of Credit such that, among other things, until June
30, 2024, Driven Lifestyle would not demand repayment of the September 2022 Cash Advance or other advances under the 12 million Line
of Credit, unless certain events occurred, as prescribed in the Support Agreement, such as the completion of a new financing arrangement
or we generate positive cash flows from operations, among others. All principal and accrued interest owed on the 12 million Line of
Credit were exchanged for equity following the completion of two debt-for-equity exchange agreements with Driven Lifestyle on January
30, 2023 and February 1, 2023, relieving us of approximately 3.9 million in owed principal and unpaid interest in exchange for an aggregate
of 780,385 shares of our Class A common stock. See Note 5 Related Party Loans in our condensed consolidated financial
statements in this Report for further information. As of September 30, 2024, the balance due to Driven Lifestyle under the 12 million
Line of Credit was 0. 

37 

As
of September 30, 2024, the 12 million Line of Credit remains in place. However, we believe that there is a substantial likelihood that
Driven Lifestyle will not fulfill any future borrowing requests, and therefore we do not view the 12 million Line of Credit as a viable
source for future liquidity needs. 

Other
Financing Activity 

On
July 29, 2024, we closed on a registered direct offering transaction with H.C. Wainwright Co., LLC acting as the exclusive placement
agent, which raised 1.0 million in gross proceeds before deducting the placement agent s fees and other offering expenses. We intend
to use the net proceeds from this offering for working capital and general corporate purposes. 

On
February 1, 2023, we issued 183,020 shares of our Class A common stock in a registered direct offering priced at-the-market under NASDAQ
rules, with a fair market value of approximately 3.9 million (the 3.9 million RDO ), before deducting placement agent
fees and other offering expenses payable by us. H.C. Wainwright Co., LLC Wainwright acted as the exclusive placement
agent for the 3.9 million RDO, pursuant to the engagement letter with us, dated as of January 9, 2023. In connection with the 3.9 million
RDO, we paid Wainwright a cash transaction fee equal to 7.0 of the aggregate gross proceeds from the registered direct offering, non-accountable
expenses of 50,000 and closing fees of 15,950. We has also issued to Wainwright warrants to purchase up to 10,981 shares of Class A
common stock, which is equal to 6.0 of the aggregate number of shares of Class A common stock placed in the 3.9 million RDO, at an
exercise price of 26.75 per share and will expire five years from the closing of the 3.9 million RDO. 

On
February 2, 2023, we issued 144,366 shares of our Class A common stock in a registered direct offering priced at-the-market under NASDAQ

direct offering, non-accountable expenses of 25,000 and closing fees of 15,950. We has also issued to Wainwright warrants to purchase
up to 8,662 shares of Class A common stock, which is equal to 6.0 of the aggregate number of shares of Class A common stock placed in
the 3.4 million RDO, at an exercise price of 29.375 per share and will expire five years from the closing of the 3.4 million RDO. 

On
February 3, 2023, we issued 232,188 shares of our Class A common stock in a registered direct offering priced at-the-market under NASDAQ
rules, with a fair market value of approximately 4.0 million (the 4.0 million RDO ), before deducting placement agent

direct offering, non-accountable expenses of 25,000 and closing fees of 15,950. We have also issued to Wainwright and its designees
warrants to purchase up to 13,931 shares of Class A common stock, which is equal to 6.0 of the aggregate number of shares of Class A
common stock placed in the 4.0 million RDO, at an exercise price of 21.738 per share and will expire five years from the closing of
the 4.0 million RDO. 

38 

Capital
Expenditures 

The
nature of our operations do not require significant expenditures on capital assets, nor do we typically enter into significant commitments
to acquire capital assets. We do not have material commitments to acquire capital assets as of September 30, 2024. 

Material
Cash Requirements 

Except
as described below, there have been no material changes in our reported material cash requirements as described under Liquidity
and Capital Resources Material Cash Requirements in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of the 2023 Form 10-K. 

On

the exclusive promoter of the British Touring Car Championship (the BTCC ), for settlement of the remaining liability in
connection with the exclusive license (the BTCC License to use certain licensed intellectual property for motorsports
and/or racing video gaming products related to, themed as, or containing the BTCC. Pursuant to the BARC Settlement Agreement, we and
BARC, without admitting any liabilities, agreed that the prior license agreement between the parties relating to the BTCC License (the
 Prior BTCC License Agreement was terminated without any liabilities and that any and all royalties and/or any other sums
whatsoever were forgiven by BARC and discharged in their entirety in consideration of (i) our one-time payment of 225,000 to BARC and
(ii) we and BARC entering, effective as of April 12, 2024, into a new license agreement to use certain licensed intellectual property
related to, themed as, or containing the BTCC. Prior to entering into the BARC Settlement Agreement, we had a total remaining liability
in connection with the Prior BTCC License Agreement, inclusive of unpaid installments, of 0.9 million. 

On
May 17, 2024, we entered into a Settlement Agreement and License with INDYCAR the INDYCAR Agreement ). The INDYCAR Agreement
resolved any and all disputes between us and INDYCAR with respect to the termination of (i) the License Agreement, dated July 13, 2021,
by and between INDYCAR and us with respect to INDYCAR SERIES racing series related gaming products and (ii) the License Agreement, dated

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
did not have, during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any relationships with any organizations or financial partnerships,
such as structured finance or special purpose entities, that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance
sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

There
have been no material changes to the items disclosed as critical accounting policies and estimates under Liquidity and Capital

Recently
Issued Accounting Standards 

As
an emerging growth company , the JOBS Act allows us to delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable
to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition
period under the JOBS Act until such time as we are no longer considered to be an emerging growth company. 

Our
analysis of recently issued accounting standards are more fully described in our condensed consolidated financial statements included
elsewhere in this Report. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange
Act )) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate,
to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024 because of the material weaknesses
in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) as discussed in
Part II, Item 9A, Controls and Procedures of the 2023 Form 10-K, and that continued to exist as of September 30,
2024. 

Remediation
of Material Weaknesses 

We
have not yet remediated the material weaknesses relating to (i) our failure to design and maintain
effective monitoring procedures and controls to evaluate the effectiveness of our individual control activities and (ii) a lack of sufficient
number of personnel with an appropriate level of accounting knowledge, training and experience to appropriately analyze, record and disclose
accounting matters timely , each of which are discussed further in Part II, Item 9A, Controls and Procedures 
of the 2023 Form 10-K. 

If
not remediated, or if we identify further material weaknesses in our internal controls, our failure to establish and maintain effective
disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our consolidated
financial statements and a failure to meet our reporting and financial obligations. We have made limited progress on the remediation
plans described in our 2023 Form 10-K, under Part II, Item 9A, Controls and Procedures. During the quarter ended
September 30, 2024, we continued our evaluation and documentation of some risks and key controls forming part of the significant business
processes, including internal control over financial reporting risk assessment scoping, and identification of key transaction level and
entity level controls that require testing on an ongoing basis. 

Limitations
on the Effectiveness of Controls 

In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes
that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must
reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of
possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Except
as described above, there were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management s evaluation
pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

40 

PART
II: OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

We
are involved in various routine legal proceedings incidental to the ordinary course of our business. We believe that the outcome of all
pending legal proceedings in the aggregate is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results
of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows, except as otherwise disclosed in this Report. In light of the uncertainties involved
in legal proceedings generally, the ultimate outcome of a particular matter could be material to our operating results for a particular
period depending on, among other things, the size of the loss or the nature of the liability imposed and the level of our income for
that particular period. See Note 9 Commitments and Contingencies Litigation in our condensed consolidated
financial statements in this Report for additional information. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

In
addition to the other information set forth in this Report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Risk Factors 
in Part I, Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks
described in the 2023 Form 10-K are not the only risks facing the Company. There have been no material changes from these risk factors
as of the date of filing of this Report. 

We
have incurred significant losses since our inception, and we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. Accordingly,
our financial condition raises substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. 

We
had negative cash flows from operations of 0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had
an accumulated deficit of 86.3 million and cash and cash equivalents of 0.8 million. We incurred a net loss of 14.3 million and had
negative cash flows from operations of 12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated
deficit of 87.4 million and cash and cash equivalents of 1.7 million. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we experienced an average
net cash burn from operations of approximately 1.1 million per month. We expect to continue to have a net cash outflow from operations
for the foreseeable future as we continue to develop our product portfolio and invest in developing new video game titles. 

As
a result of our financial condition, management has concluded that there is substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern.
Our unaudited financial statement for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were prepared under the assumption that we will continue as
a going concern; however, we have incurred losses from operations to date, and due to the lack of available cash on hand to fund our
operations over the next year and the continuing uncertainty surrounding our ability to raise funding in the form of potential capital
financing, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the financial statements are
issued. Our unaudited financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 contain an explanatory paragraph with respect to
this uncertainty. The report of our independent registered public accountant on our financial statements as of and for the years ended
December 31, 2023 and 2022 also includes explanatory language describing the existence of substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern. There have been no adjustments to the accompanying financial statements to reflect this uncertainty. See Part I,
Item 2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Going
Concern of his Report, Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations Liquidity and Going Concern of our 2023 Form 10-K and Note 1 Business Organization, Nature of Operations
and Risks and Uncertainties in our consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

If
we are unable to satisfy our capital requirements, we could be required to adopt one or more of the following alternatives: 

delaying
 the implementation of or revising certain aspects of our business strategy; 

further
 reducing or delaying the development and launch of new products and events; 

further
 reducing or delaying capital spending, product development spending and marketing and promotional spending; 

selling
 additional assets or operations; 

seeking
 additional capital contributions and/or loans from Driven Lifestyle, our other affiliates and/or third parties; 

further
 reducing other discretionary spending; 

entering
 into financing agreements on unattractive terms; and/or 

significantly
 curtailing or discontinuing operations. 

41 

There
can be no assurance that we would be able to take any of the actions referred to above because of a variety of commercial or market factors,
including, without limitation, market conditions being unfavorable for an equity or debt issuance or similar transactions, additional
capital contributions and/or loans not being available from Driven Lifestyle or affiliates and/or third parties, or that the transactions
may not be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments then in effect, such as due to restrictions on the incurrence of
debt, incurrence of liens, asset dispositions and related party transactions. In addition, such actions, if taken, may not enable us
to satisfy our capital requirements if the actions that we are able to consummate do not generate a sufficient amount of additional capital.
If we are ultimately unable to satisfy our capital requirements, we would likely need to dissolve and liquidate our assets under the
bankruptcy laws or otherwise. 

We
depend on a relatively small number of franchises for a significant portion of our revenues and profits. 

We
follow a franchise model and a significant portion of our revenues has historically been derived from products based on a relatively
small number of popular franchises, including our NASCAR products, which have historically accounted for the majority of our revenue.
For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, revenues associated with our NASCAR franchise accounted for approximately 71.6 and 62.9 
of our total revenue, respectively. Revenues associated with our NASCAR franchise accounted for approximately 52.6 and 70.9 of our
total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Following the sale of our NASCAR License and the execution
of the NASCAR New Limited License, which allows us to sell our NASCAR games and DLCs that are currently in our product portfolio through
December 31, 2024, we anticipate the amount of revenue to be generated by our existing NASCAR products to decline over time and to cease
after December 31, 2024. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, three customers accounted for 22.9 , 17.7 and 43.2 of our revenue and during the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, the same three customers accounted for 25.1 , 28.7 and 19.8 of our revenue. In addition, the same customers
represented 30.7 , 22.4 and 27.9 of our accounts receivable at September 30, 2024. 

A
reduction in sales from or loss of these customers, in a significant amount, will have a material adverse effect on the Company s
results of operations and financial condition. 

Due
to this dependence on a limited number of franchises, the failure to achieve anticipated results by one or more products based on these
franchises, or the loss of any franchise, could negatively impact our business. For example, with the consummation of the sale of our
NASCAR License to iRacing on October 3, 2023, we are no longer the official video game developer and publisher for the NASCAR video game
racing franchise and no longer have the exclusive right to create and organize esports leagues and events for NASCAR using our NASCAR
racing video games. Accordingly, we no longer have the right to use the NASCAR brand for our products other than a limited non-exclusive
right and license to, among other things, sell our NASCAR games and DLCs that are currently in our product portfolio through December
31, 2024. Similarly, our BTCC license agreement and INDYCAR license agreements were terminated
by the respective licensors, effective November 2023. We believe this will require us to modify our existing business model and
significantly alter the risk profile relating to our operations. As a result, we may encounter difficulties or challenges in continuing
operations due to the sale of our NASCAR License and the termination of our BTCC license agreement and INDYCAR
license agreements , and our cash flows and results of operations will likely be materially adversely impacted as we anticipate
the amount of revenue to be generated by our existing NASCAR products to decline over time. 

Additionally,
if the popularity of a franchise declines, we may have to write off the unrecovered portion of the underlying intellectual property assets,
which could negatively impact our business. In the future, we expect this trend to continue with a relatively limited number of franchises
producing a disproportionately high percentage of our revenues and profits.

Our
Class A common stock may be delisted from NASDAQ, which could affect the market price and liquidity of our Class A common stock. 

We
are required to continually meet NASDAQ s listing requirements, including, among other things, a minimum
stockholders equity requirement of at least 2,500,000 for continued inclusion on The Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq
Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (the Stockholders Equity Requirement ). As described in a Current Report on Form 8-K
filed with the SEC on November 22, 2023, we received a deficiency letter from NASDAQ s Listing Qualifications Department (the NASDAQ
Staff on November 17, 2023 notifying us that we were not in compliance with the
 Stockholders Equity Requirement. In our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended
September 30, 2023, we reported stockholders equity of 498,897, which was below the Stockholders Equity Requirement. Additionally,
we did not meet either of the alternative Nasdaq continued listing standards under the Nasdaq Listing Rules, which include (i) a market
value of listed securities of at least 35 million or (ii) net income of 500,000 from continuing operations in the most recently completed
fiscal year or in two of the three most recently completed fiscal years. As of December 31, 2023, our stockholders equity was
 2,089,704. 

In
accordance with NASDAQ rules, we had until January 2, 2024 to submit a plan to the NASDAQ Staff to regain compliance with the Stockholders 
Equity Requirement, which we submitted by such date. On February 5, 2024, Nasdaq notified us that, based on its review of the Company
and the materials submitted by us to NASDAQ, NASDAQ Staff determined to grant us an extension to regain compliance with the Stockholders 
Equity Requirement until May 15, 2024, subject to the Company regaining and evidencing compliance with the Stockholders Equity
Requirement by such date. 

Any
delisting of our Class A common stock from NASDAQ, including as a result of our inability to regain compliance with the Stockholders 
Equity Requirement, could adversely affect our ability to attract new investors, reduce the liquidity of our outstanding shares of Class
A common stock, reduce our ability to raise additional capital, reduce the price at which our Class A common stock trades, result in
negative publicity and increase the transaction costs inherent in trading such shares with overall negative effects for our stockholders.
We cannot assure you that our Class A common stock, if delisted from NASDAQ, will be listed on another national securities exchange or
quoted on an over-the-counter quotation system. In addition, delisting of our Class A common stock could deter broker-dealers from making
a market in or otherwise seeking or generating interest in our Class A common stock and might deter certain institutions and persons
from investing in our securities at all. For these reasons and others, delisting could adversely affect our business, financial condition
and liquidity. 

To
regain compliance with the Stockholders Equity
Requirement , we entered into the INDYCAR Agreement. Pursuant to the INDYCAR Agreement, our liability
to INDYCAR, LLC in the amount of approximately 2.9 million was settled for 400,000, which resulted in a gain of approximately 2.5
million, which resulted in a 2.5 million increase to our stockholders equity. On June 3, 2024, the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC notified
us that based on our disclosure of the INDYCAR Agreement in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed by us on May 23, 2024, Nasdaq s
staff has determined that we comply with the Stockholders Equity Requirement . In
our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, we reported stockholders equity of approximately 3.0 million;
however, because we report stockholders equity of less than 2.2 million in this Report, which is below the Stockholders 
Equity Requirement, we expect to receive a deficiency letter from the NASDAQ Staff notifying us that we are not in compliance
with the Stockholders Equity Requirement. If we fail to timely submit a plan to the NASDAQ
Staff to regain compliance with the Stockholders Equity Requirement, and to thereafter regain compliance with such requirement ,
we may be subject to delisting. At that time, Nasdaq will provide written notification to us, which we may then appeal Nasdaq s
determination to a Nasdaq Hearings Panel. 

Driven
Lifestyle controls a significant amount of our Class A common stock and all our Class B common stock and therefore it has the ability
to exert significant control over the direction of our business, which could prevent other stockholders from influencing significant
decisions regarding our business plans and other matters. 

Driven
Lifestyle currently owns all of the shares of our Class B common stock and 1,480,385 shares of our Class A common stock, which together
represents a significant combined voting power of both classes of our common stock as of November 14, 2024. Our Class B common stock has
ten times the voting power of our Class A common stock. As long as Driven Lifestyle continues to control a majority of the voting power
of our outstanding common stock, it will generally be able to determine the outcome of all corporate actions requiring stockholder approval,
including the election and removal of directors. Even if Driven Lifestyle were to control less than a majority of the voting power of
our outstanding common stock, it may be able to influence the outcome of such corporate actions so long as it owns a significant portion
of our common stock. In the event Driven Lifestyle or its affiliates relinquish beneficial ownership of any of the Driven Lifestyle Initial
Class A Shares at any time, one share of Class B common stock held by Driven Lifestyle will be cancelled for each such Driven Lifestyle
Initial Class A Share no longer beneficially owned by Driven Lifestyle or its affiliates. If, however, Driven Lifestyle does not dispose
of its Driven Lifestyle Initial Class A Shares, it could remain our controlling stockholder for an extended period of time or indefinitely. 

43 

Driven
Lifestyle s interests may not be the same as, or may conflict with, the interests of our other stockholders. Moreover, Mike Zoi,
who is the manager of Driven Lifestyle and has sole voting and dispositive power with respect to the shares of our common stock held
by Driven Lifestyle, may also have interests that are not the same as, or may conflict with, the interests of our other stockholders.
Holders of our Class A common stock will not be able to affect the outcome of any stockholder vote while Driven Lifestyle controls the
majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. As a result, Driven Lifestyle will be able to control, directly or indirectly
and subject to applicable law, all matters affecting us, including: 

any determination with respect to our business direction and policies, including the appointment and removal of officers and directors; 

any determinations with respect to mergers, business combinations or the disposition of assets; 

compensation and benefit programs and other human resources policy decisions; 

the payment of dividends on our common stock; and 

determinations with respect to tax matters. 

Because
Driven Lifestyle s interests may differ from ours or from those of our other stockholders, actions that Driven Lifestyle take with
respect to us, as our controlling stockholder, may not be favorable to us or our other stockholders, including holders of our Class A
common stock. 

We
could be subject to unanticipated adverse effects arising from our inability to fully repay Luminis International B.V. and Technology
In Business B.V., the sellers of Studio 397 B.V. Studio397 ), relating to our acquisition of 100 of the share capital
of Studio397 in April 2021. 

On
April 20, 2021 we acquired 100 of the share capital of Studio 397 B.V. Studio397 from Luminis International B.V. and
Technology In Business B.V. (collectively, the Sellers ). The purchase price originally consisted of a cash payment at closing
and payments due at a later date. To date, we have not paid all of the payments due subsequent to the closing. Pursuant to the terms
of agreements that we entered into, we are required to pay interest on the amounts owed but unpaid. The remaining balance owed as of
September 30, 2024, was 0.6 million with unpaid accrued interest of 0.3 million. As security for payment of the amounts owed, we pledged
stock of Studio397, the voting rights of which the seller could request to be transferred to it thirty days after such nonpayment.
