be available for construction later this year or early next year (collectively the 339 Lots ). 

We
charge an option fee to Benjamin Marcus Homes BMH for the right to buy the Phase 1 Lots owned by 339. The option fee
was as of February 15, 2024, and the Company will defer the revenue related to the option fee over the twelve months. As of September

the quarter ended September 30, 2024, BMH purchased five lots from 339 for both revenue and cost of land parcels sold of which
is included within non-interest income and non-interest expense, respectively, on the interim consolidated statements of operations.
No gain or loss was recognized in the sale of the lots.

Credit
Quality Information 

Effective
January 1, 2023, we adopted ASC 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, 
 which replaced the incurred loss methodology for determining out provision for credit losses and allowance for credit losses with
current expected credit loss CECL model. Upon the adoption of ASC 326 the total amount of the allowance for credit losses ACL on loans estimated using the CECL methodology increased compared to the total amount of the allowance recorded
using the prior incurred loss model. 

Based
on the Company s size, complexity and historical data the aggregate method or loss-rate method was selected to estimate expected
credit losses. An expected loss ratio is applied based on internal historical losses and originations. The aggregate method relies upon
the performance of an entire segment of the loan portfolio to best represent the behavior of these specific segments over time. In addition,
a modified open pool approach was used which utilizes our borrowers credit rankings for both construction and development loans.
Internal risk-rating grades are assigned by the Company s management based on an analysis of financial and collateral strength
and other credit attributes underlying each loan. Loan grades are A, B and C and Unsecured for both construction and development loans
where A and C defines the highest and lowest scores, respectively. Unsecured loans in our portfolio do not hold underlying collateral. 

Each
loan pool is adjusted for qualitative factors not inherently considered in the quantitative analysis. The qualitative adjustments either
increase or decrease the quantitative model estimation. We consider factors that are relevant within the qualitative framework which
include the following: lending policy, changes in nature and volume of loans, staff experience, changes in volume and trends of non-performing
loans, trends in underlying collateral values, quality of our loan review system and other economic conditions, including inflation. 

Our
Company construction loans are collateralized by land and real estate while our Company development loans are collateralized by land.
Secured nonaccrual loans individually evaluated are also collateralized by land and real estate.

For
loans greater than 12 months in age that are individually evaluated, appraisals are ordered and prepared if the current appraisal is
greater than 13 months old and construction is greater than 90 complete. If construction is less than 90 complete the Company uses
the latest appraisal on file. At certain times the Company may choose to use a broker s opinions of value BOV as
a replacement for an appraisal if deemed more efficient by management. Appraised values are adjusted for estimated costs associated with
asset disposal. A broker s opinion of selling price, use currently valid sales contracts on the subject property, or representative
recent actual closings by the builder on similar properties may be used in place of a broker s opinion of value. 

Appraisers
are state certified and are selected by first attempting to utilize the appraiser who completed the original appraisal report. If that
appraiser is unavailable or unreasonably expensive, we use another appraiser who appraises routinely in that geographic area. BOVs are
created by real estate agents. We try to first select an agent we have worked with, and then, if that fails, we select another agent
who works in that geographic area. 

In
addition, our loan portfolio includes performing, forbearance and nonaccrual loans. The Company s policies with respect to placing
loans on nonaccrual and individually evaluated if they are past due greater than 90 days unless management deems the loan an exception.
A fair market value analysis is performed and an allowance for credit loss is established based on the results of the analysis.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

(All
dollar [ ] amounts shown in thousands.) 

The
following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with
our interim consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report and with our audited annual consolidated
financial statements and related notes and other consolidated financial data (the 2023 Financial Statements included in
the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Form 10-K ). See also Cautionary
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements preceding Part I. 

Overview 

During
the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company continued to focus on the reduction of non-interest earning assets.
As of September 30, 2024, gross loan values classified as nonaccrual were 24 or 5,623 compared to 17 or 5,912 as of December 31, 2023.
In addition, as of September 30, 2024, we had six foreclosed assets, net or 1,841 compared to one or 130 as of December 31, 2023. 

The
estimated loss on interest income resulting from non-interest earning assets for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024
was 280 and 840, respectively, compared to 296 and 715 for the same periods of 2023. Looking ahead, we expect the balance of non-interest
earning assets to remain somewhat constant. 

While
the Company continues to face risks as it relates to the economy and the homebuilding industry, management has decided to focus on the
following during the remainder of 2024 and the beginning of 2025: 

1. 
 Continue
 to manage the balance of non-interest-bearing assets, which includes foreclosed real estate and nonaccrual assets. 

2. 
 Control
 SG A expenses. 

3. 
 Slightly
 increase margin, as compared to our current spread. 

4. 
 Maintain
 liquidity at a level sufficient for loan originations. 

5. 
 Manage
 the increase in loan loss and impairment expenses. 

6. 
 Maintain
 sales. 

The
current housing market is something we haven t seen before. While many factors imply that we should be in a decline in housing
values, the number of homes with a sub 3 fixed interest rate is something new to our United States housing market. Usually as housing
becomes unaffordable due to either interest rates or home prices, the sale of new homes drops, and the number of foreclosures increases.
Neither of these things is generally happening in the marketplace, even though housing is mostly unaffordable. We believe this is likely
due to the number of sub 3 mortgages that exist and are likely to continue to exist. New homes are typically 10 of available homes
for sale and are now more than 30 . It seems that the supply of used homes is unlikely to increase unless mortgage interest rates drop
substantially. The Company s foreclosed assets increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 1,840 from 130 as
of December 31, 2023. 

We
had 49,212 and 58,130 in loan receivables, net as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024,
we had 192 construction and seven development loans with 64 borrowers in 20 states. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, we transferred
from loan receivables, net to foreclosed assets and to real estate investments 2,306 and 6,122, respectively. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company completed acquisition of 339 Justabout Land Co. LLC 339 ), in a transaction
valued at 9,122. The Company paid cash consideration of 3,000 plus the amount of our intercompany debt. The Company transferred 6,122
from loan receivables, net and acquired 462 in accrued interest payable and 1,750 in secured notes payable. The Company acquired 11,330
in real estate investments from the acquisition of 339. In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 339 sold five lots
for a total sales price and cost of goods sold both of 1,601. No gain or loss was recognized on the sales. 

26 

Net
cash provided by operations decreased 591 to 5,420 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of
2023. The decrease in operating cash flow was due primarily to the reclass of proceeds from the sale of real estate investments to
operating activities from investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 of 1,601 and 2,131,
respectively and other assets, which was offset by an increase in provision for credit losses. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

To
assist in evaluating our interim consolidated financial statements, we describe below the critical accounting estimates that we use.
We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that
were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur
from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used, would have a material impact on our consolidated
financial condition or results of operations. See our 2023 Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC, for more information on our critical accounting
estimates. No material changes to our critical accounting estimates have occurred since December 31, 2023, unless listed below. 

Loan
Losses 

Fair
value of collateral has the potential to impact the calculation of the loan loss provision (the amount we have expensed over time in
anticipation of loan losses we have not yet realized). Specifically, relevant to the allowance for loan loss reserve is the fair value
of the underlying collateral supporting the outstanding loan balances. Fair value measurements are an exit price, representing the amount
that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Due to
a rapidly changing economic market, an erratic housing market, the various methods that could be used to develop fair value estimates,
and the various assumptions that could be used, determining the collateral s fair value requires significant judgment. 

Change in Fair Value Assumption 
 September 30, 2024 Loan Loss Provision Higher/(Lower) 
 
 Increasing fair value of the real estate collateral by 35 
 - 
 
 Decreasing fair value of the real estate collateral by 35 
 5,117 

Increases in the fair value of the real estate collateral do not impact the loan loss provision, as the value generally is not written
up. 

Assumes the loans were non-performing and a book amount of the loans outstanding of 49,212. 

Foreclosed
Assets 

The
fair value of real estate will impact our foreclosed asset value, which is recorded at 100 of fair value (after selling costs are deducted). 

Change in Fair Value Assumption 
 September 30, 2024 Foreclosed Assets Higher/(Lower) 
 
 Increasing fair value of the foreclosed asset by 35 
 - 
 
 Decreasing fair value of the foreclosed asset by 35 
 644 

Increases in the fair value of the foreclosed assets do not impact the carrying value, as the value generally is not written up. 
Those gains would be recognized at the sale of the assets. 

Assumes a book amount of the foreclosed assets of 1,841.

There
are three main components that can impact our interest spread: 

Difference between the interest rate received (on our loan assets) and the interest rate paid (on our borrowings). The
loans we have originated have interest rates which are based on our cost of funds, with a minimum rate of 10.25 . For most loans, the
margin is fixed at 2.5 ; however, for our development loans the margin is generally fixed at 7 . This component is also impacted by the
lending of money with no interest cost (our equity). 

Interest
income on loans for both the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 14 , compared to 14 for both same periods of 2023. 

During
both the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s margin was 5 compared to 5 and 4 for the same periods
of the prior year, respectively. The increase in margin is due to aged loans and development loans earning a higher interest rate. 

28 

We
anticipate our standard margin to be 2.5 on all future construction loans and generally 7 on all development loans, which yields a
blended margin of approximately 3.5 . This 2.5 margin may increase because some customers run past the standard repayment time and pay
a higher rate of interest after that. 

Fee income. Our construction loan fee is 5 of the amount we commit to lend, which is amortized over the expected life
of each loan. When loans terminate before their expected life, the remaining fee is recognized at that time. During 2022, we started
charging an annual fee on most of our development loans which varies. 

Fee
income on loans before deferred loan fee adjustments was 6 for both the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to
5 for both of the same periods of 2023. 

Amount of non-performing assets. Generally, two types of non-performing assets negatively affect our interest spread which
are loans not paying interest and foreclosed assets. 

As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, foreclosed assets were 1,841 and 130, respectively, which resulted in a negative impact
to our interest spread. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 the Company reclassed six construction loans to foreclosed assets
after which two were sold. As of September 30, 2024 the Company had five foreclosed assets compared to one as of December 31, 2023. 

As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, gross loans receivables nonaccrual loans or loans not earning interest were 5,623 and 5,912,
respectively. 

Provision
for credit losses 

Provision
for credit losses (expense throughout the period) was 332 and 719 for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,
compared to 131 and 294 for the same periods of the prior year. 

The
allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 810 and 695, respectively. The increase in the allowance
for credit losses is due to certain impaired assets that required completion that cost more than the original budget from the builder. In
addition, some appraised values decreased in specific markets. The Company believes it has properly reserved for all foreclosed and impaired
loans. 

Non-Interest
Income 

Other
Income 

During
the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we consulted for one of our construction and development loan customers
which included accounting guidance. Other income related to our consulting fees was 12 and 40 for the quarter and nine months ended
September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 16 and 56 for the same period of 2023. We anticipate continuing our consulting services
to our customers on an as needed basis during 2024.

Our
SG A expenses increased 123 to 714 during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. The change
in SG A for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to higher salaries and related expenses and loan and foreclosed
asset expenses. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, SG A expenses increased 95 to 2,129 compared to the same periods of 2023 due primarily
to salaries and related expenses and advertising expenses. 

Loss
on Foreclosed Assets 

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2024, impairment on foreclosed assets decreased 2 to 2 compared to the same period of 2023. The decrease
was primarily due to credits related to payments previously adjusted to the asset. In addition, we sold two of our foreclosed assets
during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 which did not result in an impairment or loss on the sale of foreclosed assets. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, impairment on foreclosed assets increased 443 to 477 compared to the same period of 2023.
The increase was primarily due to the transfer of six loan receivable assets to foreclosed assets which incurred a loss on the transfer
of 159 and additional impairment losses on foreclosed assets of 318. No foreclosed assets were transferred from loan receivables and
no impairment losses were incurred during the same period of 2023. 

Consolidated
Financial Position 

Acquisition 

Acquisition
of 339 Justabout Land Co., LLC 

Effective
February 15, 2024, the Company completed its acquisition of 339 Justabout Land Co. LLC 339 ), in a transaction valued at
 9,122. The Company paid cash consideration of 3,000 plus the amount of our intercompany debt. 

The
property has since been subdivided into two parcels. One parcel is being developed into lots and are available for home construction Phase 1 Lots and the other parcel will be developed into a second phase of lots Phase 2 Lots ), which should
be available for construction later this year or early next year (collectively the 339 Lots ). 

We
charge an option fee to Benjamin Marcus Homes BMH for the right to buy the Phase 1 Lots owned by 339. The option fee
was 890 as of February 15, 2024, and the Company will defer the revenue related to the option fee over the twelve months. As of September
30, 2024, deferred revenue, real estate investment was 297. 

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2024, BMH purchased five lots from 339 for both revenue and cost of land parcels sold of 1,601. No gain
or loss was recognized in the sale of the lots. 

The
total expected selling price of the 339 Lots is approximately 18,500 and the gross purchase price was approximately 3,900 (the Purchase
Price ). BMH immediately repaid an intercompany debt to 339 of 892, which in turn was returned to the Company, leaving the net
investment at 3,000. We purchased subject to the debt owed by 339, which included a first position development loan from the Company,
and two subordinate financings from lenders outside of the Company.

 Other liabilities

 Total liabilities assumed

Net identifiable assets acquired

The
allocation presented above is based upon management s estimate of the fair values using valuation techniques including appraisals
and purchase contracts, as well as estimating completion costs and future interest costs. In estimating the fair value of the identifiable
acquired assets and assumed liabilities, the fair value estimates are based on, but not limited to, expected future revenue and cash
flows and estimated discount rates. Except for real estate assets, all assets and liabilities are estimated at their historical carrying
values, which approximates fair value.

Credit
Quality Information 

Effective
January 1, 2023, we adopted ASC 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, 
 which replaced the incurred loss methodology for determining out provision for credit losses and allowance for credit losses with
current expected credit loss CECL model. Upon the adoption of ASC 326 the total amount of the allowance for credit losses ACL on loans estimated using the CECL methodology increased 178 compared to the total amount of the allowance recorded
using the prior incurred loss model. 

Based
on the Company s size, complexity and historical data the aggregate method or loss-rate method was selected to estimate expected
credit losses. An expected loss ratio is applied based on internal historical losses and originations. The aggregate method relies upon
the performance of an entire segment of the loan portfolio to best represent the behavior of these specific segments over time. In addition,
a modified open pool approach was used which utilizes our borrowers credit rankings for both construction and development loans.
Internal risk-rating grades are assigned by the Company s management based on an analysis of financial and collateral strength
and other credit attributes underlying each loan. Loan grades are A, B and C and Unsecured for both construction and development loans
where A and C defines the highest and lowest scores, respectively. Unsecured loans in our portfolio do not hold underlying collateral. 

34 

Each
loan pool is adjusted for qualitative factors not inherently considered in the quantitative analysis. The qualitative adjustments either
increase or decrease the quantitative model estimation. We consider factors that are relevant within the qualitative framework which
include the following: lending policy, changes in nature and volume of loans, staff experience, changes in volume and trends of non-performing
loans, trends in underlying collateral values, quality of our loan review system and other economic conditions, including inflation. 

Our
Company construction loans are collateralized by land and real estate while our Company development loans are collateralized by land.
Secured nonaccrual loans individually evaluated are also collateralized by land and real estate.

For
loans greater than 12 months in age that are individually evaluated, appraisals are ordered and prepared if the current appraisal is
greater than 13 months old and construction is greater than 90 complete. If construction is less than 90 complete the Company uses
the latest appraisal on file. At certain times the Company may choose to use a broker s opinions of value BOV as
a replacement for an appraisal if deemed more efficient by management. Appraised values are adjusted for estimated costs associated with
asset disposal. A broker s opinion of selling price, use currently valid sales contracts on the subject property, or representative
recent actual closings by the builder on similar properties may be used in place of a broker s opinion of value. 

Appraisers
are state certified and are selected by first attempting to utilize the appraiser who completed the original appraisal report. If that
appraiser is unavailable or unreasonably expensive, we use another appraiser who appraises routinely in that geographic area. BOVs are
created by real estate agents. We try to first select an agent we have worked with, and then, if that fails, we select another agent
who works in that geographic area. 

36 

In
addition, our loan portfolio includes performing, forbearance and nonaccrual loans. The Company s policies with respect to placing
loans on nonaccrual and individually evaluated if they are past due greater than 90 days unless management deems the loan an exception.
A fair market value analysis is performed and an allowance for credit loss is established based on the results of the analysis.

Allowance
for Credit Losses on Unfunded Loan Commitments 

Unfunded
commitments to extend credit, which have similar collateral, credit and market risk to our outstanding loans, were 23,237 and 25,263
as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The ACL is calculated at an estimated loss rate on the total commitment
value for loans in our portfolio. The ACL on unfunded commitments is calculated as the difference between the ACL on commitment value
less the estimated loss rated and the total gross loan value for loans in our portfolio. As of September 30,2024, the ACL for unfunded
commitments was 102. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, we had no off-balance sheet transactions, nor do we currently have any such
arrangements or obligations.

Preferred
Equity and Members Capital 

On
April 19, 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No. 4 to the Second Amended and Restated limited Liability Company Agreement Fourth
Amendment with an effective date of March 31, 2024 to effect a 100-for-1 unit split of its Series C cumulative preferred units Series C Preferred Units that became effective March 31, 2024. As a result of the split, every Series C Preferred Units,
issued and outstanding immediately prior to March 31, 2024, will automatically be reclassified (without any further act) into one hundred
Series C Preferred Units. 

45 

The
Fourth Amendment also increased the maximum number of authorized Series C Preferred Units to 20,000, of which 8,000 are to be issued
only pursuant to the Preferred Unit Reinvestment Program. In addition, pursuant to the Fourth Amendment, after six years from the date
of investment, instead of being entitled to the right of redemption, the holders of Series C Preferred Units will be entitled to convert
all or a portion of the Series C Preferred Units to the common units of the Registrant, on a 1 for 1 basis, after a 12-month waiting
period after the notice of conversion is given. 

In
addition, the Fourth Amendment restricted the right to require the Company to redeem the Series C Preferred Units for cash; therefore,
the units were reclassified from mezzanine equity to Members Capital of 6,308 as of September 30, 2024. The Company s redeemable
preferred equity was 4,773 as of December 31, 2023. 

We
strive to maintain a reasonable (about 15 balance between (1) preferred equity plus members capital and (2) total assets. The
ratio of preferred equity plus members capital to total assets was 11.5 and 10.4 as of September 30, 2024, and December 31,
2023, respectively. We anticipate this ratio to increase as more earnings are retained in 2024 and 2025 and some additional preferred
equity may be added.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Our
primary liquidity management objective is to meet expected cash flow needs while continuing to service our business and customers. As
of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we had combined loans outstanding of 199 and 236, respectively. In addition, gross loans
outstanding were 52,157 and 61,293 as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

Unfunded
commitments to extend credit, which have similar collateral, credit and market risk to our outstanding loans, were 23,237 and 25,263
as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. For off-balance-sheet credit exposures, the estimate of expected credit
losses has been presented as a liability on the balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. Other than unfunded commitments, we had no off-balance
sheet transactions, nor do we currently have any such arrangements or obligations. 

We
anticipate originations to continue to lower in 2024 due to higher interest rates which slow the sales of our customer s homes. 

46 

To
fund our combined loans, we rely on secured debt, unsecured debt, and equity, which are described in the following table:

31, 2023. The increase in secured debt was due primarily to borrowings pursuant to our loan purchase and sale agreements. 

Unsecured
debt, net of deferred financing costs increased 2,425 to 34,211 as of September 30, 2024 compared to 31,786 as of December 31, 2023.
The increase in unsecured debt was primarily due to other unsecured borrowings. 

Equity
increased 1,542 to 8,309 as of September 30, 2024, compared to 6,767 as of December 31, 2023. The increase was due primarily to contributions
from Series C Preferred Equity holders of 1,200. 

We
anticipate an increase in our equity during the three months subsequent to September 30, 2024, mostly through retained earnings. If we
are not able to maintain our equity, we will rely more heavily on raising additional funds through the Notes Program. 

The
total amount of our debt maturing through the year ending December 31, 2024, is 29,568, which consists of secured borrowings of 22,570
and unsecured borrowings of 6,998. 

Secured
borrowings maturing through the year ending December 31, 2024, significantly consists of loan purchase and sale agreements with two loan
purchasers (Builder Finance and S. K. Funding) and six lenders. These secured borrowings are listed as maturing over the next 12 months
due primarily to their related demand for loan collateral. The following are secured facilities with actual maturity and renewal dates: 

Swanson
 6,027 automatically renews unless notice given; 

Shuman
 125 due July 2025 and automatically renews unless notice is given; 

S.
 K. Funding 4,500 due July 2025 and automatically renews unless notice is given; 

S.
 K. Funding 2,000 due July 2025 and automatically renews unless notice is given; 

Builder
 Finance, Inc 6,336 with no expiration date; 

New
 LOC Agreements - 2,965 generally one-month notice and nine months to reduce principal balance to zero; 

Wallach
 LOC - 432 due upon demand; 

Wallach
 Trust - 175 due upon demand; and 

Mortgage
 Payable 4, with payments due monthly. 

Unsecured
borrowings due by December 31, 2024, consist of Notes issued pursuant to the Notes Program and other unsecured debt of 1,411 and 5,587,
respectively. To the extent that Notes issued pursuant to the Notes Program are not reinvested upon maturity, we will be required to
fund the maturities, which we anticipate funding through the issuance of new Notes in our Notes Program. Historically, approximately
73 of our Note holders reinvest upon maturity. The 36-month Note in our Notes program has a mandatory early redemption option, subject
to certain conditions. As of September 30, 2024, the 36-month Notes were 2,789. Our other unsecured debt has historically renewed. For
more information on other unsecured borrowings, see Note 7 Borrowings. If other unsecured borrowings are not renewed in the future,
we anticipate funding such maturities through investments in our Notes Program.

Summary 

We
have the funding available to address the loans we have today, including our unfunded commitments. We anticipate our assets reducing
in the remainder of 2024; however, we are prepared for an increase of our assets through the net sources and uses (12-month liquidity)
listed above as well as future capital from debt, preferred equity, and regular equity. Our expectation to reduce loan asset balances
is subject to changes in the housing market and competition. Although our secured debt is almost entirely listed as currently due because
of the underlying collateral being demand notes, much of our secured debt is either contractually set to automatically renew unless notice
is given or, in the case of purchase and sale agreements, has no end date as to when the purchasers will not purchase new loans (although
they are never required to purchase additional loans). 

Inflation,
Interest Rates, and Housing Starts 

Since
we are in the housing industry, we are affected by factors that impact that industry. Housing starts have an impact on our customers 
ability to sell their homes. Faster sales generally mean higher effective interest rates for us, as the recognition of fees we charge
is spread over a shorter period. Slower sales generally mean lower effective interest rates for us. Slower sales also are likely to increase
the default rate we experience. 

Housing
inflation has a positive impact on our operations. When we lend initially, we are lending a percentage of a home s expected value,
based on historical sales. If those estimates prove to be low (in an inflationary market), the percentage we loaned to the value decreases,
reducing potential losses on defaulted loans. The opposite is true in a deflationary housing price market. It is our opinion that values
are well above average in many of the housing markets in the U.S. today, and our lending against these values will incur more risk than
prior years. In some of our markets, prices of sold homes are dropping. This is both because some homes are selling for less and because
the average home selling is smaller (more affordable). 

Interest
rates have several impacts on our business. First, rates affect housing (starts, home size, etc.). High long-term interest rates may
decrease housing starts, including the effects listed above. Housing starts have been increasing for the last several months, but customers
are reporting longer hold times of built product. Higher interest rates will also affect our investors. We believe that there will be
a spread between the rate our Notes yield to our investors and the rates the same investors could get on deposits at FDIC insured institutions.
We also believe that the spread may need to widen if these rates rise. For instance, if we pay 7 above average CD rates when CDs are
paying 0.5 , may need a larger than 7 difference. This may cause our lending rates, which are based on our cost of funds, to be noncompetitive.
High interest rates may also increase builder defaults, as interest payments may become a higher portion of operating costs for the builder. 

However,
we note that one difference between the current housing cycle compared to prior cycles is that the supply of used homes in the market
is low due to the number of homes owned with lower interest rates. Due to the new data on used homes in the market, this makes understanding
future results an issue for the Company. Meanwhile, as housing cycles start to decline, foreclosures increase and with their initial
interest rate at 3 or less if started within the last 24 months, foreclosures may not have as large of an impact. 

48 

Below
is a chart showing three-year U.S. treasury rates and 30-year fixed mortgage rates. The U.S. treasury rates, are used by us here to approximate
CD rates. Both the short- and long-term interest rates have risen slightly to historically normal levels. 

Housing
prices are also generally correlated with housing starts; therefore, increases in housing starts usually coinciding with increases in
housing values, and the reverse is generally true. Looking at the chart below, housing starts have fallen back from the pandemic high;
however, since then the change remains relatively flat.
