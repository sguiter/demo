 NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND INFORMATION 
 Certain of the statements included or incorporated by reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as expects, believes, anticipates, intends, seeks, aims, plans, assumes, estimates, projects, should, would, could, may, will, shall or variations of such words are generally part of forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are made based on management s current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects upon Equitable Holdings, Inc. Holdings and its consolidated subsidiaries. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding projections, estimates, forecasts and other financial and performance metrics and projections of market expectations. We, us and our refer to Holdings and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context refers only to Holdings as a corporate entity. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting Holdings will be those anticipated by management. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, all matters that are not historical facts. 
 These forward-looking statements are not a guarantee of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties, and there are certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ, possibly materially, from expectations or estimates reflected in such forward-looking statements, including, among others: (i) conditions in the financial markets and economy, including the impact of geopolitical conflicts and related economic conditions, equity market declines and volatility, interest rate fluctuations, impacts on our goodwill and changes in liquidity and access to and cost of capital; (ii) operational factors, including reliance on the payment of dividends to Holdings by its subsidiaries, protection of confidential customer information or proprietary business information, operational failures by us or our service providers, potential strategic transactions, changes in accounting standards, and catastrophic events, such as the outbreak of pandemic diseases including COVID-19; (iii) credit, counterparties and investments, including counterparty default on derivative contracts, failure of financial institutions, defaults by third parties and affiliates and economic downturns, defaults and other events adversely affecting our investments; (iv) our reinsurance and hedging programs; (v) our products, structure and product distribution, including variable annuity guaranteed benefits features within certain of our products, variations in statutory capital requirements, financial strength and claims-paying ratings, state insurance laws limiting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends and key product distribution relationships; (vi) estimates, assumptions and valuations, including risk management policies and procedures, potential inadequacy of reserves and experience differing from pricing expectations, amortization of deferred acquisition costs and financial models; (vii) our Asset Management segment, including fluctuations in assets under management and the industry-wide shift from actively-managed investment services to passive services; (viii) recruitment and retention of key employees and experienced and productive financial professionals; (ix) subjectivity of the determination of the amount of allowances and impairments taken on our investments; (x) legal and regulatory risks, including federal and state legislation affecting financial institutions, insurance regulation and tax reform; (xi) risks related to our common stock and (xii) general risks, including strong industry competition, information systems failing or being compromised and protecting our intellectual property. 
 Forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements, risks, uncertainties and other factors identified in Holdings Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as amended or supplemented in our subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, including in the section entitled Risk Factors, and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. You should read this Form 10-Q completely and with the understanding that actual future results may be materially different from expectations. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as otherwise may be required by law. 
 Other risks, uncertainties and factors, including those discussed under Risk Factors, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements we make. Readers should read carefully the factors described in Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K to better understand the risks and uncertainties inherent in our business and underlying any forward-looking statements. 
 Throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q we use certain defined terms and abbreviations, which are summarized in the Glossary and Acronyms sections.

 segments: Individual Retirement, Group Retirement, Asset Management, Protection Solutions, Wealth Management and Legacy. The Company s management evaluates the performance of each of these segments independently. Effective April 1, 2024, the Company renamed its Investment Management and Research segment to Asset Management following the close of the previously announced joint venture between AllianceBernstein and Societe Generale to create Bernstein, an equity research provider and cash equity trading partner for institutional investors. Following the close of the transaction, Bernstein research business results are no longer consolidated within the financial results for AllianceBernstein and Equitable Holdings, Inc. 
 The Individual Retirement segment offers a diverse suite of variable annuity products which are primarily sold to affluent and high net worth individuals saving for retirement or seeking retirement income. 
 The Group Retirement segment offers tax-deferred investment and retirement services or products to plans sponsored by educational entities, municipalities and not-for-profit entities, as well as small and medium-sized businesses. 
 The Asset Management segment provides diversified investment management and related services globally to a broad range of clients through three main client channels - Institutional, Retail and Private Wealth. The Asset Management segment reflects the business of AB Holding and ABLP and their subsidiaries (collectively, AB). 
 The Protection Solutions segment includes the Company s life insurance and group employee benefits EB businesses. The life insurance business offers a variety of VUL, IUL and term life products to help affluent and high net worth individuals, as well as small and medium-sized business owners, with their wealth protection, wealth transfer and corporate needs. Our group EB business offers a suite of life, short- and long-term disability, dental and vision insurance products to small and medium-size businesses across the United States. 
 The Wealth Management segment is an emerging leader in the wealth management space with a differentiated advice value proposition that offers discretionary and non-discretionary investment advisory accounts, financial planning and advice, life insurance, and annuity products. 
 The Legacy segment consists of our capital intensive fixed-rate GMxB business written prior to 2011. 
 The Company reports certain activities and items that are not included in our segments in Corporate and Other. Corporate and Other includes certain of our financing and investment expenses. It also includes closed block of life insurance (the Closed Block ), run-off variable annuity reinsurance business, run-off group pension business, run-off health business, benefit plans for our employees, certain strategic investments and certain unallocated items, including capital and related investments, interest expense and corporate expense. AB s results of operations are reflected in the Asset Management segment. Accordingly, Corporate and Other does not include any items applicable to AB. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s economic interest in AB was approximately and , respectively. The General Partner of AB is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Because the General Partner has the authority to manage and control the business of AB, AB is consolidated in the Company s financial statements for all periods presented.

 The Company maintains a diversified portfolio of corporate securities across industries and issuers and does not have exposure to any single issuer in excess of of total corporate securities. The largest exposures to a single issuer of corporate securities held as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were million and million, respectively, representing and of the consolidated equity of the Company. 
 Corporate high yield securities, consisting primarily of public high yield bonds, are classified as other than investment grade by the various rating agencies, i.e., a rating below Baa3/BBB- or the NAIC Designation (as defined below) of 3 (medium investment grade), 4 or 5 (below investment grade) or 6 (in or near default). As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, approximately billion and billion, or and , of the billion and billion aggregate amortized cost of fixed maturities held by the Company were considered to be other than investment grade. These securities had gross unrealized losses of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, the billion and billion of gross unrealized losses of twelve months or more were primarily concentrated in corporate securities. In accordance with the policy described in Note 2 of the Notes to these Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company concluded that an adjustment to the allowance for credit losses for these securities was not warranted at either September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not intend to sell the securities nor was it more likely than not be required to dispose of the securities before the anticipated recovery of their remaining amortized cost basis. 
 Based on the Company s evaluation both qualitatively and quantitatively of the drivers of the decline in fair value of fixed maturity securities as of September 30, 2024, the Company determined that the unrealized loss was primarily due to increases in interest rates and credit spreads.

 Collateral Arrangements 
 The Company generally has executed a CSA under the ISDA Master Agreement it maintains with each of its OTC derivative counterparties that requires both posting and accepting collateral either in the form of cash or high-quality securities, such as U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government and government agency securities and investment grade corporate bonds. The Company nets the fair value of all derivative financial instruments with counterparties for which an ISDA Master Agreement and related CSA have been executed. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, the Company held billion and billion in cash and securities collateral delivered by trade counterparties, representing the fair value of the related derivative agreements. The unrestricted cash collateral is reported in other invested assets. The Company posted collateral of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, in the normal operation of its collateral arrangements. The Company is exposed to losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial derivative transactions with a positive fair value. The Company manages credit risk by: (i) entering into derivative transactions with highly rated major international financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties governed by master netting agreements, as applicable; (ii) trading through central clearing and OTC parties; (iii) obtaining collateral, such as cash and securities, when appropriate; and (iv) setting limits on single party credit exposures which are subject to periodic management review. 
 Substantially all of the Company s derivative agreements have zero thresholds which require daily full collateralization by the party in a liability position. In addition, certain of the Company s derivative agreements contain credit-risk related contingent features; if the credit rating of one of the parties to the derivative agreement is to fall below a certain level, the party with positive fair value could request termination at the then fair value or demand immediate full collateralization from the party whose credit rating fell and is in a net liability position.

 The Company s Level 3 liabilities include contingent payment arrangements associated with acquisitions in 2020 and 2022 by AB. At each reporting date, AB estimates the fair values of the contingent consideration expected to be paid based upon revenue and discount rate projections, using unobservable market data inputs, which are included in Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. The Company s consolidated VIEs/VOEs hold investments that are classified as Level 3, primarily corporate bonds that are vendor priced with no ratings available, bank loans, non-agency collateralized mortgage obligations and asset-backed securities. 
 
 million were transferred out of Level 3 and into Level 2 principally due to the availability of trading activity and/or market observable inputs to measure and validate their fair values. In addition, fixed maturities with fair value of million were transferred from Level 2 into the Level 3 classification. These transfers in the aggregate represent approximately of total equity as of September 30, 2024. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, fixed maturities with fair values of million were transferred out of Level 3 and into Level 2 principally due to the availability of trading activity and/or market observable inputs to measure and validate their fair values. In addition, fixed maturities with fair value of million were transferred from Level 2 into the Level 3 classification. These transfers in the aggregate represent approximately of total equity as of September 30, 2023.

 billion and billion of Level 3 fair value measurements of investments for which the underlying quantitative inputs are not developed by the Company and are not readily available. These investments primarily consist of certain privately placed debt securities with limited trading activity, including residential mortgage- and asset-backed instruments, and their fair values generally reflect unadjusted prices obtained from independent valuation service providers and indicative, non-binding quotes obtained from third-party broker-dealers recognized as market participants. Significant increases or decreases in the fair value amounts received from these pricing sources may result in the Company reporting significantly higher or lower fair value measurements for these Level 3 investments. 
 The fair value of private placement securities is determined by application of a matrix pricing model or a market comparable company value technique. The significant unobservable input to the matrix pricing model valuation technique is the spread over the industry-specific benchmark yield curve. Generally, an increase or decrease in spreads would lead to directionally inverse movement in the fair value measurements of these securities. The significant unobservable input to the market comparable company valuation technique is the discount rate. Generally, a significant increase (decrease) in the discount rate would result in significantly lower (higher) fair value measurements of these securities. 
 Residential mortgage-backed securities classified as Level 3 primarily consist of non-agency paper with low trading activity. Included in the tables above as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no Level 3 securities that were determined by application of a matrix pricing model and for which the spread over the U.S. Treasury curve is the most significant unobservable input to the pricing result. Generally, a change in spreads would lead to directionally inverse movement in the fair value measurements of these securities. 
 Asset-backed securities classified as Level 3 primarily consist of non-agency mortgage loan trust certificates, including subprime and Alt-A paper, credit risk transfer securities, and equipment financings. Included in the tables above as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no securities that were determined by the application of matrix-pricing for which the spread over the U.S. Treasury curve is the most significant unobservable input to the pricing result. Significant increases (decreases) in spreads would have resulted in significantly lower (higher) fair value measurements. 
 Other Equity Investments 
 Included in other equity investments classified as Level 3 are venture capital securities in the Technology, Media and Telecommunications industries. The fair value measurements of these securities include significant unobservable inputs including an enterprise value to revenue multiples and a discount rate to account for liquidity and various risk factors. Significant increases (decreases) in the enterprise value to revenue multiple inputs in isolation would have resulted in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. Significant increases (decreases) in the discount rate would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. 
 Market Risk Benefits 
 Significant unobservable inputs with respect to the fair value measurement of the purchased MRB assets and MRB liabilities identified in the table above are developed using Company data. Future policyholder behavior is an unobservable market assumption and, as such, all aspects of policyholder behavior are derived based on recent historical experience. These policyholder behaviors include lapses, pro-rata withdrawals, dollar for dollar withdrawals, GMIB utilization, deferred mortality and payout phase mortality. Many of these policyholder behaviors have dynamic adjustment factors based on the relative value of the rider as compared to the account value in different economic environments. This applies to all variable annuity related products; products with GMxB riders including but not limited to GMIB, GMDB, and GWL. 
 Lapse rates are adjusted at the contract level based on a comparison of the value of the GMxB rider and the current policyholder account value, which include other factors such as considering surrender charges. Generally, lapse rates are assumed to be lower in periods when a surrender charge applies. A dynamic lapse function reduces the base lapse rate when the guaranteed amount is greater than the account value as in-the-money contracts are less likely to lapse. For valuing purchased MRB assets and MRB liabilities, lapse rates vary throughout the period over which cash flows are projected.

 Mortgage Loans on Real Estate 
 Fair values for commercial, agricultural and residential mortgage loans on real estate are measured by discounting future contractual cash flows to be received on the mortgage loan using interest rates at which loans with similar characteristics and credit quality would be made. The discount rate is derived based on the appropriate U.S. Treasury rate with a like term to the remaining term of the loan to which a spread reflective of the risk premium associated with the specific loan is added. Fair values for mortgage loans anticipated to be foreclosed and problem mortgage loans are limited to the fair value of the underlying collateral, if lower. 
 Policy Loans 
 The fair value of policy loans is calculated by discounting expected cash flows based upon the U.S. Treasury yield curve and historical loan repayment patterns. 
 Policyholder Liabilities - Investment Contracts and Separate Accounts Liabilities 
 The fair values for deferred annuities and certain annuities, which are included in policyholders account balances, and liabilities for investment contracts with fund investments in Separate Accounts, are estimated using projected cash flows discounted at rates reflecting current market rates. Significant unobservable inputs reflected in the cash flows include lapse rates and withdrawal rates. Incremental adjustments may be made to the fair value to reflect non-performance risk. Certain other products such as the Company s association plans contracts, supplementary contracts not involving life contingencies, Access Accounts and Escrow Shield Plus product reserves are held at book value.

 For other matters, the Company is currently not able to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss. The Company is often unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss until developments in such matters have provided sufficient information to support an assessment of the range of possible loss, such as quantification of a damage demand from plaintiffs, discovery from plaintiffs and other parties, investigation of factual allegations, rulings by a court on motions or appeals, analysis by experts and the progress of settlement discussions. On a quarterly and annual basis, the Company reviews relevant information with respect to litigation and regulatory contingencies and updates the Company s accruals, disclosures and reasonably possible losses or ranges of loss based on such reviews.

 million and above. A second putative class action was filed in the District of Arizona in 2017 and consolidated with the Brach matter in federal court in New York. The consolidated amended class action complaint alleged the following claims: breach of contract; misrepresentations in violation of Section 4226 of the New York Insurance Law; violations of New York General Business Law Section 349; and violations of the California Unfair Competition Law, and the California Elder Abuse Statute. Plaintiffs sought: (a) compensatory damages, costs, and, pre- and post-judgment interest; (b) with respect to their claim concerning Section 4226, a penalty in the amount of premiums paid by the plaintiffs and the putative class; and (c) injunctive relief and attorneys fees in connection with their statutory claims. In August 2020, the federal district court issued a decision certifying nationwide breach of contract and Section 4226 classes, and a New York State Section 349 class. Owners of a substantial number of policies opted out of the Brach class action. Most have settled pre-litigation, but a minority of opt-out policies are not yet the subject of litigation. Others filed suit previously, including pending individual federal actions that were coordinated with the Brach action and contained similar allegations. In May 2023, the Brach class action and Equitable Financial informed the federal district court that they had mutually agreed to settle the class action, and in October 2023, the federal district court entered an order of final approval of the settlement agreement. Equitable Financial is fully accrued for the class settlement, which will have no impact on earnings or distributable cash projections. In October 2023, Equitable Financial and the plaintiffs with individual federal actions coordinated with the Brach action informed the court that they had reached a settlement, and those actions were dismissed. Equitable Financial is likewise fully accrued for those individual settlements, which will have no impact on earnings or distributable cash projections. Equitable Financial has settled other actual and threatened litigations challenging the COI increase by individual policy owners and entities. 
 Finally, action is also pending against Equitable Financial in New York state court. In July 2022, the trial court in Hobish v. AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company, granted in significant part Equitable Financial s motion for summary judgment and denied plaintiff s cross motion. That plaintiff appealed but the appellate court affirmed the trial court s decision. In March 2024, the intermediate appellate court granted plaintiff s motion for leave to appeal to the state s highest appellate court. Equitable Financial is vigorously defending each of these matters. 
 As with other financial services companies, Equitable Financial periodically receives informal and formal requests for information from various state and federal governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations in connection with inquiries and investigations of the products and practices of the Company or the financial services industry. It is the practice of the Company to cooperate fully in these matters.

 The Company is the obligor under certain structured settlement agreements it had entered into with unaffiliated insurance companies and beneficiaries. To satisfy its obligations under these agreements, the Company owns single premium annuities issued by previously wholly-owned life insurance subsidiaries. The Company has directed payment under these annuities to be made directly to the beneficiaries under the structured settlement agreements. A contingent liability exists with respect to these agreements should the previously wholly-owned subsidiaries be unable to meet their obligations. Management believes the need for the Company to satisfy those obligations is remote.

 reportable segments: Individual Retirement, Group Retirement, Asset Management, Protection Solutions, Wealth Management and Legacy. 
 These segments reflect the manner by which the Company s chief operating decision maker views and manages the business. A brief description of these segments follows: 
 The Individual Retirement segment offers a diverse suite of variable annuity products which are primarily sold to affluent and high net worth individuals saving for retirement or seeking retirement income. 
 The Group Retirement segment offers tax-deferred investment and retirement services or products to plans sponsored by educational entities, municipalities, and not-for-profit entities, as well as small and medium-sized businesses. 
 The Asset Management segment provides diversified investment management and related solutions globally to a broad range of clients through main client channels - Institutional, Retail and Private Wealth. 
 The Protection Solutions segment includes our life insurance and group EB businesses. Our life insurance business offers a variety of VUL, UL and term life products to help affluent and high net worth individuals, as well as small and medium-sized business owners, with their wealth protection, wealth transfer and corporate needs. Our group EB business offers a suite of life, and short- and long-term disability, dental and vision insurance products to small and medium-size businesses across the United States. 
 The Wealth Management segment offers discretionary and non-discretionary investment advisory accounts, financial planning and advice, life insurance, and annuity products through Equitable Advisors. 
 The Legacy segment primarily consists of the capital intensive fixed-rate GMxB business written in the Individual Retirement market prior to 2011. This business offered GMDB features in isolation or together with GMLB features. This business also historically offered variable annuities with types of guaranteed living benefit riders: GMIB, GWBL/GMWB, and GMAB. 
 Measurement 
 Operating earnings (loss) is the financial measure which primarily focuses on the Company s segments results of operations as well as the underlying profitability of the Company s core business. By excluding items that can be distortive and unpredictable such as investment gains (losses) and investment income (loss) from derivative instruments, the Company believes operating earnings (loss) by segment enhances the understanding of the Company s underlying drivers of profitability and trends in the Company s segments. 
 Operating earnings is calculated by adjusting each segment s net income (loss) attributable to Holdings for the following items: 
 Items related to variable annuity product features, which include: (i) changes in the fair value of MRB and purchased MRB, including the related attributed fees and claims, offset by derivatives and other securities used to hedge the MRB which result in residual net income volatility as the change in fair value of certain securities is reflected in OCI and due to our statutory capital hedge program; and (ii) market adjustments to deposit asset or liability accounts arising from reinsurance agreements which do not expose the reinsurer to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk; 
 Investment (gains) losses, which includes credit loss impairments of securities/investments, sales or disposals of securities/investments, realized capital gains/losses and valuation allowances;

 million and million for Individual Retirement, million and million for Group Retirement, million and million for Protection Solutions, million and million for Legacy, and an increase of million and million for Corporate and Other. The impact to operating earnings for each segment during the quarters of 2023 was not material. Total Company operating earnings were not impacted. 
 During the third quarter 2024, the Company moved revenues and expenses related to payout annuitizations from the Legacy segment to the Individual Retirement segment. Now all payout annuities will be reported within the Individual Retirement segment as the block is managed on an aggregate basis. Prior periods have been recast to reflect this change. 
 Revenues derived from any customer did not exceed 10 of revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 The Company accounts for inter-segment sales and transfers as if the sales or transfers were to third parties, that is, at current market prices.

 million in statutory special surplus funds as of September 30, 2024. The Reinsurance Treaty reduced the amount of interest rate hedging needed at Equitable Financial going forward, affecting future deferrals, but leaves our historical SSAP 108 deferred amounts unchanged. The permitted practice also reset Equitable Financial s unassigned surplus to as of June 30, 2021 to reflect the transformative nature of the Venerable Transaction. 
 The NAIC Accounting Practices and Procedures manual NAIC SAP has been adopted as a component of prescribed or permitted practices by the State of New York. However, Reg 213 adopted in May of 2019 and as amended in February 2020 and March 2021, differs from the NAIC variable annuity reserve and capital framework. Reg 213 requires Equitable Financial to carry statutory basis reserves for its variable annuity contract obligations equal to the greater of those required under (i) the NAIC standard or (ii) a revised version of the NYDFS requirement in effect prior to the adoption of the first amendment for contracts issued prior to January 1, 2020, and for policies issued after that date a new standard that in current market conditions imposes more conservative reserving requirements for variable annuity contracts than the NAIC standard. 
 The impact of the application of Reg 213 was a decrease of approximately million in statutory surplus as of September 30, 2024 compared to statutory surplus under the NAIC variable annuity framework. Our hedging program is designed to hedge the economics of our insurance liabilities and largely offsets Reg 213 and NAIC framework reserve movements due to interest rates and equities. The NYDFS allows domestic insurance companies a five year phase-in provision for Reg 213 reserves. As of September 30, 2022, Equitable Financial s Reg 213 reserves were phased-in. As of September 30, 2024, given the prevailing market conditions and business mix, there are million Reg 213 redundant reserves over the US RBC CTE 98 total asset requirement TAR ). 
 During the fourth quarter 2020, Equitable Financial received approval from NYDFS for its proposed amended Plan of Operation for Separate Account No. 68 SA 68 for our Structured Capital Strategies product and Separate Account No. 69 SA 69 for our EQUI-VEST product Structured Investment Option, to change the accounting basis of these two non-insulated Separate Accounts from fair value to book value in accordance with Section 1414 of the Insurance Law to align with how we manage and measure our overall General Account asset portfolio. In order to facilitate this change and comply with Section 4240(a)(10), the Company also sought approval to amend the Plans to remove the requirement to comply with Section 4240(a)(5)(iii) and substitute it with a commitment to comply with Section 4240(a)(5)(i). Similarly, the Company updated the reserves section of each Plan to reflect the fact that Regulation 128 would no longer be applicable upon the change in accounting basis. We applied this change effective January 1, 2021. The impact of the application is an increase of approximately billion in statutory surplus as of September 30, 2024. 
 During 2022, Equitable America received approval from the Arizona Department of Insurance and Financial Institutions pursuant to A.R.S. 20-515 for Separate Account No. 68A SA 68A for our Structured Capital Strategies product, Separate Account No. 69A SA 69A for our EQUI-VEST product Structured Investment Option and Separate Account No. 71A SA 71A for our Investment Edge Structured Investment Option, to permit us to use book value as the accounting basis of these three non-insulated Separate Accounts instead of fair value in accordance with the NAIC Accounting and Practices and Procedures Manual to align with how we manage and measure our overall General Account asset portfolio. The impact of the application is a decrease of approximately million in statutory surplus as of September 30, 2024.

 interest in the global joint venture and SocGen would own a interest, with an option to reach ownership after . 
 During the fourth quarter of 2023, AB and SocGen negotiated a plan (the Revised Plan to form a global joint venture with joint venture holding companies, outside of North America and within North America NA JV , and together the JVs ). Effective April 1, 2024, AB and SocGen completed their previously announced transaction in accordance with the Revised Plan. AB owns a majority interest in the NA JV while SocGen owns a majority interest in the joint venture outside of North America. While AB currently owns a majority of the NA JV, the structure of the Board of Directors of the NA JV, which includes independent directors, in addition to directors from AB and directors from SocGen, precludes AB s control of the Board thereby permitting deconsolidation of the Bernstein Research Services BRS business. Going forward, AB will maintain an equity method investment in each of the JVs and report on the performance of the JV holding companies on a combined basis. 
 As a result of the greater value of the business AB contributed to the JVs, SocGen paid AB million in cash to equalize the value of the contributions by AB and SocGen to the JVs. The cash payment of million included million of prepaid consideration for an option, exercisable by AB during the next , that would result in SocGen having a ownership of the NA JV (the AB option and bringing the transaction ownership terms back in line with the Initial Plan. AB s option may only be exercised upon receipt of appropriate regulatory approvals. The million cash payment was used to pay down debt under AB s existing credit facilities. 
 Under the terms of the transaction and assuming AB exercises its option as noted above, SocGen would increase its ownership to a majority interest of the NA JV, without further consideration payable. AB has an additional option to sell its ownership interests in the JVs to SocGen after , at the fair market value of AB s interests in the JVs, subject to regulatory approval. The ultimate objective of SocGen and AB is for SocGen to eventually own of the JVs after . 
 AB has deconsolidated the BRS business and retained the Bernstein Private Wealth Management business within its existing U.S. broker dealer, SCB LLC. AB s Private Wealth Management business continues to operate through SCB LLC and SCB LLC continues to serve as custodian for nearly all Private Wealth assets under management. AB continues to serve as investment adviser to these Private Wealth clients. Further AB entered into certain transition services agreements with the JVs in connection with the divestiture of the BRS business. From April 1, 2024 through September 30, 2024 AB provided services and recognized revenues of million associated with these transition services agreements. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 AB recognized million in revenues associated with these transaction services agreements. 
 The net carrying amount of the BRS business assets and liabilities included in the sale was million. As a result of the sale, AB recognized a pre-tax gain of million during the second quarter of 2024. AB deconsolidated approximately million of net assets and liabilities of the BRS business and contributed those assets and liabilities to the JVs. AB recorded an initial investment in each JV, at fair value, using the equity method of investment totaling million. The fair value of the equity method investments was determined using a dividend discount model whereby a forecast of net banking income attributable to each of the JVs is discounted using an estimated cost of capital to determine the present value of expected future dividends. 
 In addition, AB recorded a liability of approximately million, based on the negotiated terms of the Revised Plan, related to the AB option. Upon receipt of appropriate regulatory approvals, AB intends to exercise the AB option and will recognize a gain or loss at that time, dependent upon the fair market value of the additional equity interest that would result in SocGen having ownership interest in NA JV. 
 As of December 31, 2023 the assets and liabilities of AB s research services business recorded at fair value, less cost were classified as HFS in our Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result of classifying these assets as HFS, AB recognized a non-cash valuation adjustment of million on the consolidated statement of income, to recognize the net carrying value at lower of cost or fair value, less costs to sell.

 Executive Summary 
 Overview 
 We are one of America s leading financial services companies, providing: (i) advice and solutions for helping Americans set and meet their retirement goals and protect and transfer their wealth across generations; and (ii) a wide range of investment management insights, expertise and innovations to drive better investment decisions and outcomes for clients worldwide. 
 We manage our business through six segments: Individual Retirement, Group Retirement, Asset Management, Protection Solutions, Wealth Management and Legacy. We report certain activities and items that are not included in these segments in Corporate and Other. See Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our segments. 
 We benefit from our complementary mix of businesses. This business mix provides diversity in our earnings sources, which helps offset fluctuations in market conditions and variability in business results, while offering growth opportunities. 
 
 Macroeconomic and Industry Trends 
 Our business and consolidated results of operations are significantly affected by economic conditions and consumer confidence, conditions in the global capital markets and the interest rate environment. 
 Financial and Economic Environment 
 U.S. equity markets showed strength in the third quarter 2024, benefiting from a resilient U.S. economy with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics issuing a strong September 2024 jobs report that exceeded expectations, cooling inflation, and a widely held outlook for monetary easing, including a half-point interest rate reduction in September 2024, with additional, smaller rate cuts expected in the fourth quarter of 2024 and into 2025 (based on statements of members of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System). 
 A wide variety of factors continue to impact financial and economic conditions. These factors include, among others, uncertainty regarding the federal debt limit, concerns regarding inflation, high fuel and energy costs, changes in fiscal or monetary policy and geopolitical tensions, including the U.S. presidential election. The Russian invasion of the Ukraine, the Israel-Hamas war and broader Middle Eastern hostilities, including with Hezbollah in Lebanon and Iran, and the ensuing conflicts and the sanctions and other measures imposed in response to these conflicts, significantly contributed to volatility in the financial markets and have increased the level of economic and political uncertainty. 
 Stressed conditions, volatility and disruptions in the capital markets, particular markets, or financial asset classes can have an adverse effect on us, in part because we have a large investment portfolio. In addition, our insurance liabilities and derivatives are sensitive to changing market factors, including equity market performance and interest rates. An increase in market volatility could continue to affect our business, including through effects on the yields we earn on invested assets, changes in required reserves and capital and fluctuations in the value of our AUM, AV or AUA from which we derive our fee income. These effects could be exacerbated by uncertainty about future fiscal policy, changes in tax policy, the scope of potential deregulation and levels of global trade. 
 86 

Table of Contents 

 The potential for increased volatility could pressure sales and reduce demand for our products as consumers consider purchasing alternative products to meet their objectives. In addition, this environment could make it difficult to consistently develop products that are attractive to customers. Financial performance can be adversely affected by market volatility and equity market declines as fees driven by AV and AUM fluctuate, hedging costs increase and revenues decline due to reduced sales and increased outflows. 
 We monitor the behavior of our customers and other factors, including mortality rates, morbidity rates, annuitization rates and lapse and surrender rates, which change in response to changes in capital market conditions, to ensure that our products and solutions remain attractive and profitable. For additional information on our sensitivity to interest rates and capital market prices, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Regulatory Developments 
 Our life insurance subsidiaries are regulated primarily at the state level, with some policies and products also subject to federal regulation. In addition, Holdings and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation under the insurance holding company laws of various U.S. jurisdictions. Furthermore, on an ongoing basis, regulators refine capital requirements and introduce new reserving standards. Regulations recently adopted or currently under review can potentially impact our statutory reserve, capital requirements and profitability of the industry and result in increased regulation and oversight for the industry. 
 Insurance Regulation 
 Regulation of Investments 
 The NAIC is evaluating the risks associated with insurers investments in certain categories of structured securities, including CLOs. In March 2023, the NAIC adopted an amendment to the Purposes and Procedures Manual to give the NAIC s Structured Securities Group, housed within the NAIC s Securities Valuation Office (the, SVO ), responsibility for modeling CLO securities and evaluating tranche level losses across all debt and equity tranches under a series of calibrated and weighted collateral stress scenarios in order to assign NAIC Designations. Under the amended Purposes and Procedures Manual, CLO investments will no longer be broadly exempt from filing with the SVO based on ratings from Credit Rating Providers. The NAIC s goal is to ensure that the weighted average RBC factor for owning all tranches of a CLO more closely aligns with what would be required for directly owning all of the underlying loan collateral, in order to avoid RBC arbitrage. In June 2024, the NAIC approved interim rules that raise capital requirements for holdings of CLO and other asset-backed security residual interests. The NAIC is also collaborating with interested parties to develop and refine the process for modeling CLO investments. In August 2024, the NAIC delayed a requirement for insurers to begin reporting the financially modeled NAIC Designations for CLOs with their financial statement filings to year-end 2025 to allow more time to develop the modeling methodology. 
 In related work, the NAIC s Financial Condition (E) Committee continues to develop a Framework for Regulation of Insurer Investments A Holistic Review (the Investment Framework related to insurer investment risk regulation, on which work began in 2023. The primary objective of the Investment Framework is to highlight areas where the insurance regulatory framework and the SVO can be enhanced to strengthen oversight of insurers investments in complex assets. The proposed changes to modernize investment oversight include (i) reducing / eliminating blind reliance on credit rating providers while continuing to use them by implementing a due diligence framework that oversees the effectiveness of credit rating providers; and (ii) bolstering the SVO s risk analysis capabilities by investing in a risk analytics tool and adding specialized personnel. 
 In August 2024, the NAIC s Financial Condition (E) Committee adopted an amendment to the Purposes and Procedures Manual that is designed to address the NAIC s concerns about reliance on third-party credit ratings in the filing exemption process. The goal is to limit reliance on such credit ratings and enhance the SVO s role in the filing exemption process. The NAIC developed the Purposes and Procedures Manual amendment to allow the SVO to challenge a security s filing-exempt status based on a credit rating. 
 The Purposes and Procedures Manual amendment, as adopted by the Financial Condition (E) Committee, sets forth procedures for SVO staff to identify and evaluate a filing-exempt security with an NAIC Designation determined by a rating that appears to be an unreasonable assessment of investment risk. The procedures include sending an information request to insurers that hold the security under review and determining whether the NAIC Designation is three or more notches different from the SVO s assessment, which would allow the SVO to request the removal of the credit rating from the filing exempt process. At any time during the process, an alternate credit rating may be requested and, if one is received, it will be incorporated into the filing exempt process. The Purposes and Procedures Manual amendment is scheduled to become effective on January 1, 2026, although the amendment still has to be adopted by the NAIC at its national meeting in November 2024.

 Fiduciary Rules 
 In 2023, the U.S. Department of Labor (the DOL proposed a regulation to change the definition of fiduciary for purposes of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ERISA and parallel provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), when a financial professional, including an insurance producer, provides investment advice, and proposed amendments to various existing prohibited transaction exemptions PTEs ), including PTE 84-14 that financial professionals rely on when they make investment recommendations to retirement investors. On April 23, 2024, the DOL finalized and published this new definition of fiduciary for purposes of ERISA and parallel provisions of the Code and finalized and published amendments to these PTEs (the new definition and the PTE amendments collectively, the Final Rule ). 
 Various industry groups brought litigation against the DOL seeking a variety of remedies for the Final Rule. On July 25, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (the E.D. Tex. issued a stay of the effective date of portions of the Final Rule. On July 26, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas (the N.D. Tex. issued a stay of the effective date of the Final Rule as a whole. As a result of these court opinions, it is uncertain whether the Final Rule will become effective. 
 The DOL has appealed the stay issued in the E.D. Tex. litigation to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The DOL has also filed an interlocutory appeal challenging the stay issued in the N.D. Tex. litigation to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit; the parties have jointly agreed to stay further proceedings pending the outcome of the interlocutory appeal. 
 While this litigation proceeds, we are evaluating the potential impact of the Final Rule on our business, particularly as it pertains to the sale of insurance products to retirement investors. 
 For additional information on regulatory developments and the risks we face, see Business Regulation in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and Risk Factors Legal and Regulatory Risks in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Revenues 
 Our revenues come from three principal sources: 
 fee income derived from our retirement and protection products and our asset management services; 
 premiums from our traditional life insurance and annuity products; and 
 investment income from our General Account investment portfolio. 
 Our fee income varies directly in relation to the amount of the underlying AV or benefit base of our retirement and protection products, the amount of AUM and AUA in our Wealth Management business, and the amount of AUM in our Asset Management business. AV and AUM, each as defined in Key Operating Measures, are influenced by changes in economic conditions, primarily equity market returns, as well as net flows. Our premium income is driven by the growth in new policies written and the persistency of our in-force policies, both of which are influenced by a combination of factors, including our efforts to attract and retain customers and market conditions that influence demand for our products. Our investment income is driven by the yield on our General Account investment portfolio and is impacted by the prevailing level of interest rates as we reinvest cash associated with maturing investments and net flows to the portfolio. 
 Benefits and Other Deductions 
 Our primary expenses are: 
 policyholders benefits and interest credited to policyholders account balances; 
 sales commissions and compensation paid to intermediaries and advisors that distribute our products and services; and 
 compensation and benefits provided to our employees and other operating expenses. 
 88 

Table of Contents 

 Policyholders benefits are driven primarily by mortality, customer withdrawals, and benefits which change in response to changes in capital market conditions. In addition, some of our policyholders benefits are directly tied to the AV and benefit base of our variable annuity products. Interest credited to policyholders varies in relation to the amount of the underlying AV or benefit base. Sales commissions and compensation paid to intermediaries and advisors vary in relation to premium and fee income generated from these sources, whereas compensation and benefits to our employees are more constant and impacted by market wages and decline with increases in efficiency. Our ability to manage these expenses across various economic cycles and products is critical to the profitability of our company. 
 Net Income Volatility 
 We have offered and continue to offer variable annuity products with GMxB features. The future claims exposure on these features is sensitive to movements in the equity markets and interest rates. Accordingly, we have implemented hedging and reinsurance programs designed to mitigate the economic exposure to us from these features due to equity market and interest rate movements. Changes in the values of the derivatives associated with these programs due to equity market and interest rate movements, together with the GMxB MRBs assets and liabilities are recognized in the periods in which they occur. This results in net income volatility as further described below. In addition, net income is impacted by changes in our reinsurers credit spread, while changes in the Company s credit spread is recorded in other comprehensive income. See Significant Factors Impacting Our Results Impact of Hedging and GMxB Reinsurance on Results. 
 In addition to our dynamic hedging strategy, we have static hedge positions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of changing market conditions on our statutory capital. We believe this program will continue to preserve the economic value of our variable annuity contracts and better protect our target variable annuity asset level. However, these static hedge positions increase the size of our derivative positions and may result in net income volatility on a period-over-period basis. 
 Due to the impacts on our net income of equity market and interest rate movements and other items that are not part of the underlying profitability drivers of our business, we evaluate and manage our business performance using Non-GAAP Operating Earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure that is intended to remove these impacts from our results. See Key Operating Measures Non-GAAP Operating Earnings. 
 
 Significant Factors Impacting Our Results 
 The following significant factors have impacted, and may in the future impact, our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 Impact of Hedging and GMxB Reinsurance on Results 
 We have offered and continue to offer variable annuity products with GMxB features. The future claims exposure on these features is sensitive to movements in the equity markets and interest rates. Accordingly, we have implemented hedging and reinsurance programs designed to mitigate the economic exposure to us from these features due to equity market and interest rate movements. These programs include: 
 Variable annuity hedging programs. We use a dynamic hedging program (within this program, generally, we reevaluate our economic exposure at least daily and rebalance our hedge positions accordingly) to mitigate certain risks associated with the GMxB features that are embedded in our liabilities for our variable annuity products. This program utilizes various derivative instruments that are managed in an effort to reduce the economic impact of unfavorable changes in GMxB features exposures attributable to movements in the equity markets and interest rates. Although this program is designed to provide a measure of economic protection against the impact of adverse market conditions, it does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Accordingly, changes in value of the derivatives will be recognized in the period in which they occur with offsetting changes in reserves recognized in the current period. In addition, we utilize AFS fixed maturity securities in our General Account to mitigate the economic impact of unfavorable changes in GMxB features exposures attributable to movements in interest rates. However, the economic effect of interest rate changes on such securities is reflected in OCI, which results in net income volatility as the economic effect of interest rates on our GMxB MRB liabilities is reflected in net income. 
 In addition to our dynamic hedging program, we have a hedging program using static hedge positions (derivative positions intended to be HTM with less frequent re-balancing) to protect our statutory capital against stress scenarios. This program, in addition to our dynamic hedge program, has increased the size of our derivative positions, resulting in additional net income volatility. The impacts are most pronounced for variable annuity products.

 GMxB reinsurance contracts. Historically, GMxB reinsurance contracts were used to cede to non-affiliated reinsurers a portion of our exposure to variable annuity products that offer GMxB features. We account for the reinsurance contracts as MRBs and report them at fair value. In addition, on June 1, 2021, we ceded legacy variable annuity policies sold by Equitable Financial between 2006-2008 (the Block ), comprised of non-New York Accumulator policies containing fixed rate GMIB and/or GMDB guarantees. 
 Effect of Assumption Updates on Operating Results 
 During the third quarter of each year, we conduct our annual review of the assumptions underlying the valuation of DAC, deferred sales inducement assets, unearned revenue liabilities, liabilities for future policyholder benefits and MRB for our Individual Retirement, Group Retirement, Protection Solutions, and Legacy segments (assumption reviews are not relevant for the Asset Management and Wealth Management segments). Assumptions are based on a combination of Company experience, industry experience, management actions and expert judgement and reflect our best estimate as of the date of the applicable financial statements. 
 Most of the variable annuity products, variable universal life insurance and universal life insurance products we offer maintain policyholder deposits that are reported as liabilities and classified within either Separate Accounts liabilities or policyholder account balances. Our products and riders also impact liabilities for future policyholder benefits, MRBs and unearned revenues and assets for DAC and DSI. The valuation of these assets and liabilities (other than deposits) is based on differing accounting methods depending on the product, each of which requires numerous assumptions and considerable judgment. The accounting guidance applied in the valuation of these assets and liabilities includes, but is not limited to, the following: (i) traditional life insurance products for which assumptions are updated annually to estimate the value of future death, morbidity or income benefits; (ii) universal life insurance and variable life insurance secondary guarantees for which benefit liabilities are determined by estimating the expected value of death benefits payable when the account balance is projected to be zero and recognizing those benefits ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments; and (iii) certain product guarantees reported as MRBs at fair value. 
 
 Assumption Updates and Model Changes 
 We conduct our annual review of our assumptions and models during the third quarter of each year. We also update our assumptions as needed in the event we become aware of economic conditions or events that could require a change in our assumptions that we believe may have a significant impact to the carrying value of product liabilities and assets and consequently materially impact our earnings in the period of the change.

 Key Operating Measures 
 In addition to our results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we report Non-GAAP Operating Earnings, Non-GAAP Operating ROE, and Non-GAAP operating common EPS, each of which is a measure that is not determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Management principally uses these non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating performance because they present a clearer picture of our operating performance and they allow management to allocate resources. Similarly, management believes that the use of these Non-GAAP financial measures, together with relevant U.S. GAAP measures, provide investors with a better understanding of our results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers and trends of our business. These non-GAAP financial measures are intended to remove from our results of operations the impact of market changes (where there is a mismatch in the valuation of assets and liabilities) as well as certain other expenses which are not part of our underlying profitability drivers or likely to re-occur in the foreseeable future, as such items fluctuate from period-to-period in a manner inconsistent with these drivers. These measures should be considered supplementary to our results that are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be viewed as a substitute for the U.S. GAAP measures. Other companies may use similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures that are calculated differently from the way we calculate such measures. Consequently, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. 
 We also discuss certain operating measures, including AUM, AUA, AV, Protection Solutions reserves and certain other operating measures, which management believes provide useful information about our businesses and the operational factors underlying our financial performance. 
 Non-GAAP Operating Earnings 
 Non-GAAP Operating Earnings is an after-tax non-GAAP financial measure used to evaluate our financial performance on a consolidated basis that is determined by making certain adjustments to our consolidated after-tax net income attributable to Holdings. The most significant of such adjustments relates to our derivative positions, which protect economic value and statutory capital, and the variable annuity product MRBs. This is a large source of volatility in net income. 
 Non-GAAP Operating Earnings equals our consolidated after-tax net income attributable to Holdings adjusted to eliminate the impact of the following items: 
 Items related to variable annuity product features, which include: (i) changes in the fair value of MRB and purchased MRB, including the related attributed fees and claims, offset by derivatives and other securities used to hedge the MRB which result in residual net income volatility as the change in fair value of certain securities is reflected in OCI and due to our statutory capital hedge program; and (ii) market adjustments to deposit asset or liability accounts arising from reinsurance agreements which do not expose the reinsurer to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk; 
 Investment (gains) losses, which includes credit loss impairments of securities/investments, sales or disposals of securities/investments, realized capital gains/losses and valuation allowances; 
 Net actuarial (gains) losses, which includes actuarial gains and losses as a result of differences between actual and expected experience on pension plan assets or projected benefit obligation during a given period related to pension, other postretirement benefit obligations, and the one-time impact of the settlement of the defined benefit obligation; 
 Other adjustments, which primarily include restructuring costs related to severance and separation, lease write-offs related to non-recurring restructuring activities, COVID-19 related impacts, net derivative gains (losses) on certain Non-GMxB derivatives, Net investment income from certain items including consolidated VIE investments, seed capital mark-to-market adjustments, unrealized gain/losses and realized capital gains/losses from sales or disposals of select securities, certain legal accruals; a bespoke deal to repurchase UL policies from one entity that had invested in numerous policies purchased in the life settlement market, which disposed of the risk of additional COI litigation by that entity related to those UL policies, impact of the annual actuarial assumption updates attributable to LFPB when the majority of the impact relates to the non-core business; and 
 Income tax expense (benefit) related to the above items and non-recurring tax items, which includes the effect of uncertain tax positions for a given audit period and changes to the deferred tax valuation allowance.

Table of Contents 

 In the third quarter 2023, the Company updated its operating earnings measure to exclude the impact of the annual actuarial assumption update attributable to LFPB as the majority of the earnings volatility attributable to these assumption updates relate to the Company s Legacy and non-business segment products and as such do not represent the Company s ongoing revenue generating activities or future business strategy, and impedes comparability of operating results period over period. Non-GAAP Operating Earnings were favorably impacted by this change in the amount of 61 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 In the first quarter of 2024, the Company began allocating to its business segments collateral expense resulting from a designated rate to be paid on the collateral held back to counterparties. The new segment allocation methodology for collateral expense is based on the income earned on cash equivalents held in the surplus segments and income earned in portfolios backing collateral expenses, such that the collateral expense would be allocated to the segments up to that amount. Any remaining amount is included within Corporate and Other. This expense was previously recorded in Corporate and Other with no allocation to our business segments in prior reporting periods. 
 The presentation of operating earnings in prior periods was not revised to reflect this modification, however, the Company estimated that allocating collateral expense to the segments for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, would have resulted in a decrease to operating earnings of 4.0 million and 0.8 million for Individual Retirement, 7.7 million and 1.4 million for Group Retirement, 21.9 million and 2.5 million for Protection Solutions, 4.2 million and 1.0 million for Legacy, and an increase of 37.8 million and 5.7 million for Corporate and Other. The impact to operating earnings for each segment during the quarters of 2023 was not material. Total Company operating earnings were not impacted. 
 During the third quarter 2024, the Company moved revenues and expenses related to payout annuitizations from the Legacy segment to the Individual Retirement segment. Now all payout annuities will be reported within the Individual Retirement segment as the block is managed on an aggregate basis. Prior periods have been recast to reflect this change. 
 Because Non-GAAP Operating Earnings excludes the foregoing items that can be distortive or unpredictable, management believes that this measure enhances the understanding of the Company s underlying drivers of profitability and trends in our business, thereby allowing management to make decisions that will positively impact our business. 
 We use the prevailing corporate federal income tax rate of 21 while taking into account any non-recurring differences for events recognized differently in our financial statements and federal income tax returns as well as partnership income taxed at lower rates when reconciling Net income (loss) attributable to Holdings to Non-GAAP Operating Earnings.

 Non-GAAP Operating ROE 
 We calculate Non-GAAP Operating ROE by dividing Non-GAAP Operating Earnings for the previous twelve calendar months by consolidated average equity attributable to Holdings common shareholders, excluding AOCI. AOCI fluctuates period-to-period in a manner inconsistent with our underlying profitability drivers as the majority of such fluctuation is related to the market volatility of the unrealized gains and losses associated with our AFS securities. Therefore, we believe excluding AOCI is more effective for analyzing the trends of our operations. 
 The following table presents return on average equity attributable to Holdings common shareholders, excluding AOCI and Non-GAAP Operating ROE for the year ended September 30, 2024.

 Consolidated Results of Operations 
 Our consolidated results of operations are significantly affected by conditions in the capital markets and the economy because we offer market sensitive products. These products have been a significant driver of our results of operations. Because the future claims exposure on these products is sensitive to movements in the equity markets and interest rates, we have in place various hedging and reinsurance programs that are designed to mitigate the economic risk of movements in the equity markets and interest rates. The volatility in net income attributable to Holdings for the periods presented below results from the mismatch between: (i) the change in carrying value of the reserves for GMDB and certain GMIB features that do not fully and immediately reflect the impact of equity and interest market fluctuations; (ii) the change in fair value of products with the GMIB feature that have a no-lapse guarantee; and (iii) our hedging and reinsurance programs. 
 Ownership and Consolidation of AllianceBernstein 
 Our indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary, AllianceBernstein Corporation, is the General Partner of AB. Accordingly, AB s results are fully reflected in our consolidated financial statements. For additional information on our economic interest in AB, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Operating earnings decreased 26 million to 93 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 119 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is mainly due to lower Net investment income as a result of lower average asset balances. 
 Net Flows and AV 
 The increase in AV of 414 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by 2.5 billion of market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows of 2.0 billion. 
 Net outflows of 2.0 billion were 387 million higher than in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, mainly driven by continuing runoff of the business. 
 
 Corporate and Other 
 Corporate and Other includes some of our financing and investment expenses. It also includes: the Closed Block, run-off variable annuity reinsurance business, run-off group pension business, run-off health business, benefit plans for our employees, certain strategic investments and certain unallocated items, including capital and related investments, interest expense and financing fees and corporate expense. AB s results of operations are reflected in the Asset Management segment. Accordingly, Corporate and Other does not include any items applicable to AB. 
 The following table summarizes operating earnings (loss) of Corporate and Other:

 General Account Investment Portfolio 
 Our investment philosophy is driven by our long-term commitments to clients, robust risk management and strategic asset allocation. Our General Account investment portfolio investment strategy seeks to achieve sustainable risk-adjusted returns by focusing on principal preservation and investment return, subject to duration and liquidity requirements by product as well as diversification of investment risks. Investment activities are undertaken based on established investment guidelines and are required to comply with applicable laws and insurance regulations. 
 115 

Risk tolerances are established for credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk and concentration risk across issuers and asset classes, each of which seek to mitigate the impact of cash flow variability arising from these risks. Significant interest rate increases and market volatility since 2022 have reduced the fair value of fixed maturities from a net unrealized gain position to a net unrealized loss. As a part of asset and liability management, we maintain a weighted average duration for our General Account investment portfolio that is within an acceptable range of the estimated duration of our liabilities given our risk appetite and hedging programs. 
 The General Account investment portfolio consists largely of investment grade fixed maturities, short-term investments, commercial, agricultural and residential mortgage loans, alternative investments and other financial instruments. Fixed maturities include publicly issued corporate bonds, government bonds, privately placed notes and bonds, bonds issued by states and municipalities, agency and non-agency mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities. In addition, from time to time we use derivatives to hedge our exposure to equity markets, interest rates, foreign currency and credit spreads. 
 We incorporate ESG factors into the investment processes for a significant portion of our General Account portfolio. As investors with a long-term horizon, we believe that companies with sustainable practices are better positioned to deliver value to stakeholders over an extended period. These companies are more likely to increase sales through sustainable products, reduce energy costs and attract and retain talent. This belief underpins our approach to sustainable investing, where we seek to enhance the sustainability and quality of our investment portfolio. 
 Investments in our surplus portfolio are generally comprised of a mix of fixed maturity investment grade and below investment grade securities as well as various alternative investments, primarily private equity and real estate equity. Although alternative investments are subject to period over period earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved returns in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio. 
 The General Account investment portfolio reflects certain differences from the presentation of the U.S. GAAP Consolidated Financial Statements. This presentation is consistent with how we manage the General Account investment portfolio. For further investment information, see Note 3 and Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Investment Results of the General Account Investment Portfolio 
 The following table summarizes the General Account investment portfolio results with Non-GAAP Operating Earnings adjustments by asset category for the periods indicated. This presentation is consistent with how we measure investment performance for management purposes.

 Fixed Maturities Credit Quality 
 The SVO of the NAIC evaluates the investments of insurers for regulatory reporting purposes and assigns fixed maturities to one of six categories NAIC Designations ). NAIC Designations of 1 or 2 include fixed maturities considered investment grade, which include securities rated Baa3 or higher by Moody s or BBB- or higher by Standard Poor s. NAIC Designations of 3 through 6 are referred to as below investment grade, which include securities rated Ba1 or lower by Moody s and BB+ or lower by Standard Poor s. As a result of time lags between the funding of investments and the completion of the SVO filing process, the fixed maturity portfolio typically includes securities that have not yet been rated by the SVO as of each balance sheet date. Pending receipt of SVO ratings, the categorization of these securities by NAIC Designation is based on the expected ratings indicated by internal analysis.

Mortgage Loans 
 The mortgage portfolio primarily consists of commercial, agricultural, and residential mortgage loans. The investment strategy for the mortgage loan portfolio emphasizes diversification by property type and geographic location with a primary focus on asset quality. The commercial mortgage loan portfolio is backed by high quality properties located in primary markets typically owned by experienced institutional investors with a demonstrated ability to manage their assets through business cycles. Our commercial loan portfolio is monitored on an ongoing basis, assigning credit quality ratings for each loan, with the particular emphasis on loans that are scheduled to mature in the next 12 to 24 months. Scheduled maturities for the remainder of 2024 and full year 2025, respectively are 0.4 billion and 1.9 billion, or 3 and 12 of the commercial mortgage portfolio. The commercial mortgage portfolio consists of 87 fixed rate loans and 13 floating rate loans. For floating rate loans, the borrower is typically required to purchase an interest rate cap to the scheduled maturity of the loan to protect against rising rates. 
 Commercial mortgage loans are evaluated annually to determine a current LTV ratio. Property financial statements, current rent roll, lease maturities, tenant creditworthiness, property physical inspections, and forecasted leasing market strength are used to develop projected cash flows. A discounted cash flow methodology which incorporates market data is used to determine property values. The average LTV ratio at origination provided by a certified appraisal firm was 53 . The average LTV ratio was 67 and 64 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which reflects the most recent opinion of value on the underlying collateral. 
 Over the past year, we began working with CarVal to establish investment programs in residential whole loans and other private and public securities. These programs allow us to leverage CarVal s expertise in asset classes where we are looking to increase exposure. The residential mortgage portfolio primarily consists of purchased closed end, amortizing residential mortgage loans. The investment strategy for the mortgage loan portfolio emphasizes high credit quality borrowers, conservative LTV ratios, superior ability to repay and geographic diversification. 
 Residential mortgage loans are pooled by loan type (i.e., Jumbo, Agency Eligible, Non-Qualified, etc.) and pooled by similar risk profiles (including consumer credit score and LTV ratios). The portfolio is monitored monthly primarily based on payment activity, occurrence of regional natural disasters and borrower interactions with the mortgage servicer. 
 The tables below show the breakdown of the amortized cost of the General Account s investments in mortgage loans by geographic region and property type:

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity refers to our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash from our operating, investment and financing activities to meet our cash requirements with a prudent margin of safety. Capital refers to our long-term financial resources available to support business operations and future growth. Our ability to generate and maintain sufficient liquidity and capital is dependent on the profitability of our businesses, timing of cash flows related to our investments and products, our ability to access the capital markets, general economic conditions and the alternative sources of liquidity and capital described herein. When considering our liquidity and cash flows, we distinguish between the needs of Holdings and the needs of our insurance and non-insurance subsidiaries. We also distinguish and separately manage the liquidity and capital resources of our retirement and protection businesses (our Individual Retirement, Group Retirement, Protection Solutions and Legacy segments) and our Asset Management and Wealth Management segments. 
 
 Sources and Uses of Liquidity 
 The Company has sufficient cash flows from operations to satisfy liquidity requirements in 2024. 
 Cash Flows of Holdings 
 As a holding company with no business operations of its own, Holdings primarily derives cash flows from dividends from its subsidiaries and distributions related to its economic interest in AB, all of which is currently held outside our insurance company subsidiaries. These principal sources of liquidity are augmented by cash and short-term investments held by Holdings and access to bank lines of credit and the capital markets. The main uses of liquidity for Holdings are interest payments and debt repayment, payment of dividends and other distributions to stockholders (which may include stock repurchases) loans and capital contributions, if needed, to our insurance subsidiaries. Our principal sources of liquidity and our capital position are described in the following paragraphs.

 Capital Contribution to Our Subsidiaries 
 No capital contributions were made during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Loans from Our Subsidiaries 
 There were no new loans from our subsidiaries during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Cash Distributions from Our Non-Insurance Subsidiaries 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Holdings received cash distributions of 341 million from AB and 178 million from the investment management contracts with EFIM and EIM. 
 
 Distributions from Insurance Subsidiaries 
 Our insurance companies are subject to limitations on the payment of dividends and other transfers of funds to Holdings and other affiliates under applicable insurance law and regulation. Also, more generally, the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends can be affected by market conditions and other factors beyond our control. 
 Equitable's primary insurance regulators are the NYDFS and the state of Arizona. Under New York s insurance laws, which are applicable to Equitable Financial, a domestic stock life insurer may not pay an Ordinary Dividend exceeding an amount calculated based on a statutory formula without prior approval of the NYDFS. Extraordinary Dividends require the insurer to file a notice of its intent to declare the dividends with the NYDFS and obtain prior approval or non-disapproval from the NYDFS. Similarly, under Arizona Insurance Law, which is applicable to Equitable America, a domestic life insurer may not pay a dividend to its shareholders that exceeds an amount calculated based on a statutory formula without prior approval of the Arizona Superintendent. 
 124 

In 2024, Equitable America has Ordinary Dividend capacity of 441 million. In June 2024, Equitable America received approval from Arizona Department of Insurance and Financial Institutions for an Extraordinary Dividend of 300 million. Holdings received an Ordinary Dividend distribution from Equitable America of 441 million during July 2024. Holdings received a dividend distribution from Equitable America of 22 million during September 2024 under the Extraordinary Dividend capacity, leaving 278 million of remaining capacity for 2024. Based on the NYDFS formula, Equitable Financial has no Ordinary Dividend capacity in 2024. 
 
 Distributions from AllianceBernstein 
 ABLP is required to distribute all of its Available Cash Flow, as defined in the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement of ABLP, to the holders of AB Units and to the General Partner. Available Cash Flow is defined as the cash flow received by ABLP from operations minus such amounts as the General Partner determines, in its sole discretion, should be retained by ABLP for use in its business, or plus such amounts as the General Partner determines, in its sole discretion, should be released from previously retained cash flow. Distributions by ABLP are made 1 to the General Partner and 99 among the limited partners. 
 Typically, Available Cash Flow has been the adjusted diluted net income per unit for the quarter multiplied by the number of general and limited partnership interests at the end of the quarter. In future periods, management of AB anticipates that Available Cash Flow will be based on adjusted diluted net income per unit, unless management of AB determines, with the concurrence of the Board of Directors of AB, that one or more adjustments that are made for adjusted net income should not be made with respect to the Available Cash Flow calculation. 
 AB Holding is required to distribute all of its Available Cash Flow, as defined in the Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of AB Holding, to holders of AB Holding Units pro rata in accordance with their percentage interest in AB Holding. Available Cash Flow is defined as the cash distributions AB Holding receives from ABLP minus such amounts as the General Partner determines, in its sole discretion, should be retained by AB Holding for use in its business (such as the payment of taxes) or plus such amounts as the General Partner determines, in its sole discretion, should be released from previously retained cash flow. AB Holding is dependent on the quarterly cash distributions it receives from ABLP, which is subject to the performance of capital markets and other factors beyond our control. Distributions from AB Holding are made pro rata based on the holder s percentage ownership interest in AB Holding. 
 As of September 30, 2024, Holdings and its non-insurance company subsidiaries hold approximately 170.1 million AB Units, 4.6 million AB Holding Units and the 1 General Partnership interest in ABLP. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the ownership structure of ABLP, including AB Units outstanding as well as the General Partner s 1 interest, was as follows: 
 Owner Percentage Ownership EQH and its subsidiaries 60.0 AB Holding 39.3 Unaffiliated holders 0.7 Total 100.0 
 Including both the general partnership and limited partnership interests in AB Holding and ABLP, Holdings and its subsidiaries had an approximate 61.6 economic interest in AB as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Holdings Credit Facilities 
 On June 24, 2021, Holdings entered into the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement with respect to a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility ), which lowered the facility amount to 1.5 billion and extended the maturity date to June 24, 2026, among other changes. The Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement amends the Revolving Credit Agreement entered into by Holdings on February 16, 2018, as amended on March 22, 2021. 
 On December 15, 2023, the Company added a 75 million commitment from TD Bank to the Credit Facility, raising the facility amount to 1.6 billion. Additionally, the Company entered in a letter of credit facility with MUFG Bank on January 23, 2024, in a face amount of 200 million to replace a 150 million facility with HSBC that expired on February 16, 2024. 
 125 

The Credit Facility may provide significant support to our liquidity position when alternative sources of credit are limited. In addition to the Credit Facility, we have letter of credit facilities with an aggregate principal amount of approximately 1.9 billion (the LOC Facilities ), primarily to be used to support our life insurance business reinsured to EQ AZ Life Re in April 2018. In June 2021, Holdings entered into amendments with each of the issuers of its bilateral letter of credit facilities to effect changes similar to those effected in the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement. The respective facility limits of the bilateral letter of credit facilities remained unchanged. On May 12, 2023, the Company entered into an amendment to the Credit Facility and LOC Facilities to replace remaining LIBOR-based benchmark rates with SOFR-based benchmark rates and to make certain other conforming changes. 
 The Credit Facility and LOC Facilities contain certain administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants, including requirements to maintain a specified minimum consolidated net worth and to maintain a ratio of indebtedness to total capitalization not in excess of a specified percentage, and limitations on the dollar amount of indebtedness that may be incurred by our subsidiaries and the dollar amount of secured indebtedness that may be incurred by us, which could restrict our operations and use of funds. The right to borrow funds under the Credit Facility and LOC Facilities is subject to the fulfillment of certain conditions, including compliance with all covenants, and the ability to borrow thereunder is also subject to the continued ability of the lenders that are or will be parties to the facilities to provide funds. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with these covenants.

Sources and Uses of Liquidity of Our Insurance Subsidiaries 
 The principal sources of liquidity for our insurance subsidiaries are premiums, investment and fee income, deposits associated with our insurance and annuity operations, cash and invested assets, as well as internal borrowings. The principal uses of that liquidity include benefits, claims and dividends paid to policyholders and payments to policyholders in connection with surrenders and withdrawals. Other uses of liquidity include commissions, general and administrative expenses, purchases of investments, the payment of dividends to Holdings and hedging activity. Certain of our insurance subsidiaries principal sources and uses of liquidity are described in the paragraphs that follow. 
 We manage the liquidity of our insurance subsidiaries with the objective of ensuring that they can meet payment obligations linked to our Individual Retirement, Group Retirement and Protection Solutions businesses and to their outstanding debt and derivative positions, including in our hedging programs, without support from Holdings. We employ an asset/liability management approach specific to the requirements of each of our insurance businesses. We measure liquidity against internally-developed benchmarks that consider the characteristics of our asset portfolio and the liabilities that it supports in both the short-term (the next 12 months) and long-term (beyond the next 12 months). We consider attributes of the various categories of our liquid assets (for example, type of asset and credit quality) in calculating internal liquidity indicators for our insurance and reinsurance operations. Our liquidity benchmarks are established for various stress scenarios and durations, including company-specific and market-wide events. The scenarios we use to evaluate the liquidity of our subsidiaries are defined to allow operating entities to operate without support from Holdings. 
 
 Liquid Assets 
 The investment portfolios of our insurance subsidiaries are a significant component of our overall liquidity. Liquid assets include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, U.S. Treasury fixed maturities, fixed maturities that are not designated as HTM and public equity securities. We believe that our business operations and the liquidity profile of our assets provide sufficient liquidity under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios for each of our insurance subsidiaries. 
 See General Account Investment Portfolio and Note 3 and Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our retirement and protection businesses portfolio of liquid assets. 
 
 Hedging Activities 
 Because the future claims exposure on our insurance products, and in particular our variable annuity products with GMxB features, is sensitive to movements in the equity markets and interest rates, we have in place various hedging and reinsurance programs that are designed to mitigate the economic risks of movements in the equity markets and interest rates. We use derivatives as part of our overall asset/liability risk management program primarily to reduce exposures to equity market and interest rate risks. In addition, we use credit derivatives to replicate exposure to individual securities or pools of securities as a means of achieving credit exposure similar to bonds of the underlying issuer(s) more efficiently. The derivative contracts are an integral part of our risk management program, especially for the management of our variable annuities program, and are collectively managed to reduce the economic impact of unfavorable movements in capital markets. These derivative transactions require liquidity to meet payment obligations such as payments for periodic settlements, purchases, maturities and terminations as well as liquid assets pledged as collateral related to any decline in the net estimated fair value. Collateral calls represent one of our biggest drivers for liquidity needs for our insurance subsidiaries. Our derivatives contracts reside primarily within Equitable Financial, which has a significantly large investment portfolio.

 Sources and Uses of Liquidity of our Asset Management Segment 
 The principal sources of liquidity for our Asset Management business include investment management fees and borrowings under its credit facilities and commercial paper program. The principal uses of liquidity include general and administrative expenses, business financing and distributions to holders of AB Units and AB Holding Units plus interest and debt service. The primary liquidity risk for our fee-based Asset Management business is its profitability, which is impacted by market conditions and our investment management performance. 
 
 AB Commercial Paper 
 As of September 30, 2024, AB had 0 million of commercial paper outstanding. As of December 31, 2023, AB had 254 million of commercial paper outstanding with an interest rate of 5.4 .

Average daily borrowings for the commercial paper outstanding during the third quarter 2024 and full year 2023 were 304 million and 268 million, respectively, with weighted average interest rates of approximately 5.4 and 5.2 , respectively. 
 AB Credit Facility 
 AB has an 800 million committed, unsecured senior revolving credit facility (the AB Credit Facility with a group of commercial banks and other lenders which matures on October 13, 2026. The credit facility provides for possible increases in the principal amount by up to an aggregate incremental amount of 200 million. Any such increase is subject to the consent of the affected lenders. The AB Credit Facility is available for AB and SCB LLC for business purposes, including the support of AB s commercial paper program. Both AB and SCB LLC can draw directly under the AB Credit Facility and AB management expects to draw on the AB Credit Facility from time to time. AB has agreed to guarantee the obligations of SCB LLC under the AB Credit Facility. 
 The AB Credit Facility contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, which are customary for facilities of this type, including, among other things, restrictions on dispositions of assets, restrictions on liens, a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio. As of September 30, 2024, AB was in compliance with these covenants. The AB Credit Facility also includes customary events of default (with customary grace periods, as applicable), including provisions under which, upon the occurrence of an event of default, all outstanding loans may be accelerated and/or lender s commitments may be terminated. Also, under such provisions, upon the occurrence of certain insolvency- or bankruptcy-related events of default, all amounts payable under the AB Credit Facility would automatically become immediately due and payable, and the lender s commitments would automatically terminate. 
 Amounts under the Credit Facility may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed by us from time to time until the maturity of the facility. Voluntary pre-payments and commitment reductions requested by AB are permitted at any time without a fee (other than customary breakage costs relating to the pre-payment of any drawn loans) upon proper notice and subject to a minimum dollar requirement. Borrowings under the AB Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum, which will be, at AB s option, a rate equal to an applicable margin, which is subject to adjustment based on the credit ratings of AB, plus one of the following indices: a term Secured Overnight Financial Rate; a Prime rate; or the Federal Funds rate.

 Statutory Capital of Our Insurance Subsidiaries 
 Our capital management framework for our insurance subsidiaries is primarily based on statutory RBC standards and the CTE asset standard for our variable annuity business. 
 RBC requirements are used as minimum capital requirements by the NAIC and the state insurance departments to evaluate the capital condition of regulated insurance companies. RBC is based on a formula calculated by applying factors to various asset, premium, claim, expense and statutory reserve items. The formula takes into account the risk characteristics of the insurer, including asset risk, insurance risk, interest rate risk, market risk and business risk and is calculated on a quarterly basis and made public on an annual basis. The formula is used as an early warning regulatory tool to identify possible inadequately capitalized insurers for purposes of initiating regulatory action, and not as a means to rank insurers generally. These rules apply to our insurance company subsidiaries and not to Holdings. State insurance laws provide insurance regulators the authority to require various actions by, or take various actions against, insurers whose TAC does not meet or exceed certain RBC levels. At the date of the most recent annual statutory financial statements filed with insurance regulators, the TAC of each of these insurance company subsidiaries subject to these requirements was in excess of each of those RBC levels. 
 See Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relating to Prescribed and Permitted Statutory Accounting practices and its impact on our statutory surplus. 
 129 

Captive Reinsurance Company 
 We use a captive reinsurance company to more effectively manage our reserves and capital on an economic basis and to enable the aggregation and transfer of risks. Our captive reinsurance company assumes business from affiliates only and is closed to new business. Our captive reinsurance company is a wholly-owned subsidiary located in the United States. In addition to state insurance regulation, our captive reinsurance company is subject to internal policies governing its activities. We continue to analyze the use of our existing captive reinsurance structure, as well as additional third-party reinsurance arrangements. 
 
 Borrowings 
 Our financial strategy going forward will remain subject to market conditions and other factors. For example, we may from time to time enter into additional bank or other financing arrangements, including public or private debt, structured facilities and contingent capital arrangements, under which we could incur additional indebtedness. 
 The following table sets forth the Company s total consolidated borrowings. Short-term and long-term debt consists of the following: 
 September 30, December 31, 2024 2023 (in millions) Short-term debt: AB commercial paper 254 Total short-term debt 254 Long-term debt: Senior Debenture, (7.0 , due 2028) 250 349 Senior Note (4.35 due 2028) 1,494 1,493 Senior Note (4.572 due 2029) 301 Senior Note (5.594 due 2033) 497 497 Senior Note (5.00 due 2048) 1,289 1,481 Total long-term debt 3,831 3,820 Total borrowings 3,831 4,074 
 
 Notes and Debentures 
 The Senior Notes and Senior Debentures contain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including a limitation on certain liens and a limit on the Company s ability to consolidate, merge or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets. The Senior Notes and Senior Debentures also include customary events of default (with customary grace periods, as applicable), including provisions under which, upon the occurrence of an event of default, all outstanding Senior Notes and Senior Debentures may be accelerated. As of September 30, 2024, the Company is in compliance with all debt covenants. 
 
 Ratings 
 Financial strength ratings (which are sometimes referred to as claims-paying ratings) and credit ratings are important factors affecting public confidence in an insurer and its competitive position in marketing products. Our credit ratings are also important for our ability to raise capital through the issuance of debt and for the cost of such financing. 
 Financial strength ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding the financial ability of an insurance company to meet its obligations under an insurance policy. Credit ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding an entity s ability to repay its indebtedness. The following table summarizes the ratings for Holdings and certain of its subsidiaries. AM Best, S P and Moody s have a stable outlook.

 Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. For a discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The most critical estimates include those used in determining: 
 MRBs and purchased MRBs 
 accounting for reinsurance; 
 estimated fair values of investments in the absence of quoted market values and investment impairments; 
 estimated fair values of freestanding derivatives and the recognition and estimated fair value of embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation; 
 goodwill and related impairment; 
 measurement of income taxes and the valuation of deferred tax assets; and 
 liabilities for litigation and regulatory matters. 
 In applying our accounting policies, we make subjective and complex judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Many of these policies, estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries while others are specific to our business and operations. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 There have been no material changes to the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk described in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 in Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk . 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act.

 Item 5. Other Information 
 Securities Trading Plans of Directors and Executive Officers 
 A significant portion of the compensation of our executive officers is delivered in the form of equity awards, including restricted stock units and performance shares. All vehicles contain vesting requirements related to service, with performance shares also requiring the satisfaction of certain performance criteria related to corporate performance to obtain a payout. This compensation design is intended to align executive compensation with the performance experienced by our shareholders. Following the delivery of shares of our common stock under those equity awards, once any applicable service- or performance-based vesting standards have been satisfied, our executive officers from time to time engage in the open-market sale of some of those shares. Our executive officers may also engage from time to time in other transactions involving our securities. 
 Transactions in our securities by our executive officers are required to be made in accordance with our Insider Trading Policy, which, among other things, requires that the transactions be in accordance with applicable U.S. federal securities laws that prohibit trading while in possession of material nonpublic information. Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act provides an affirmative defense that enables prearranged transactions in securities in a manner that avoids concerns about initiating transactions at a future date while possibly in possession of material nonpublic information. Our Insider Trading Policy permits our executive officers to enter into trading plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1.
