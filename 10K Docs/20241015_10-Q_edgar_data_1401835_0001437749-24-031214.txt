As used in this Quarterly Report, the terms we, us, our, Star Gold, and the Company , mean Star Gold Corp., unless otherwise indicated. All dollar amounts in this Quarterly Report are expressed in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise indicated. Management s Discussion and Analysis is intended to be read in conjunction with the Company s financial statements and the integral notes Notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending April 30, 2024. The following statements may be forward-looking in nature and actual results may differ materially. 
 
 Corporate Background 
 
 The Company was originally incorporated on December 8, 2006, under the laws of the State of Nevada as Elan Development, Inc. On April 25, 2008, the name of the Company was changed to Star Gold Corp. Star Gold Corp. is a pre-development stage company engaged in the acquisition and exploration of precious metal deposit properties and advancing them toward production. The Company is engaged in the business of exploring, evaluating and acquiring mineral prospects with the potential for economic deposits of precious and base metals. 
 
 Star Gold Corp. originally leased with an option to acquire certain unpatented mining claims located in the State of Nevada which in part make up what we refer to as the Longstreet Property or the Longstreet Project. The Longstreet Property in its entirety comprises 142 mineral claims: 75 original optioned claims, of which 70 are unpatented staked claims and five claims leased from local ranchers, pursuant to the Clifford Lease as well as 50 claims subsequently staked by Star Gold. The Longstreet Property covers a total area of approximately 2,500 acres (1,012 ha). The Longstreet Project is at an intermediate stage of exploration. 
 
 The Company has no patents, licenses, franchises or concessions which are considered by the Company to be of importance. The business is not of a seasonal nature. Because minerals are traded in the open market, the Company has little to no control over the competitive conditions in the industry. 
 
 Overview of Mineral Exploration and Current Operations 
 
 Star Gold Corp. is a pre-development stage mineral company with no producing mines. Mineral exploration is essentially a research activity that does not produce a product. The Company acquires properties which it believes have potential to host economic concentrations of minerals, particularly gold and silver. These acquisitions have and may take the form of unpatented mining claims on federal land, or leasing claims, or private property owned by others. An unpatented mining claim is an interest, that can be acquired, in the mineral rights on open lands of the federally owned public domain. Claims are staked in accordance with the Mining Law of 1872, recorded with the federal government pursuant to laws and regulations established by the Bureau of Land Management. The Company intends to remain in the business of exploring for mining properties that have the potential to produce gold, silver, base metals and other commodities. 
 
 The Company will perform basic geological work to identify specific drill targets on the properties, and then collect subsurface samples by drilling to confirm the presence of mineralization (the presence of economic minerals in a specific area or geological formation). The Company may enter joint venture agreements with other companies to fund further exploration and/or development work. It is the Company s plan to focus on assembling a high-quality group of mid-stage mineral (primarily gold and silver) exploration prospects, using the experience and contacts of the management group. By such prospects, the Company means properties that have been previously identified by third parties, (including prior owners and/or exploration companies), as mineral prospects with potential for economic mineralization. Often these properties have been sampled, mapped and sometimes drilled, usually with indefinite results. Accordingly, such acquired projects will have either prior exploration history or will have strong similarity to a recognized geologic ore deposit model. Geographic emphasis will be placed on the western United States. 
 
 The geologic potential and ore deposit models have been defined and specific drill targets identified on the Longstreet Property. The Company s property evaluation process involves using basic geologic fieldwork to perform an initial evaluation of a property. If the evaluation is positive, the Company seeks to acquire, either by staking unpatented mining claims on open public domain, or by leasing the property from the owner of private property or the owner of unpatented claims. Once acquired, the Company then typically makes a more detailed evaluation of the property. This detailed evaluation involves expenditures for exploration work which may include rock and soil sampling, geologic mapping, geophysics, trenching, drilling or other means to determine if economic mineralization is present on a property.

 The Company shall pay Clifford a 2 net smelter royalty on net smelter returns which is inclusive of the overall 3 net smelter royalty for the properties. 

Compliance with Government Regulations 
 
 Continuing to acquire and explore mineral properties in the State of Nevada will require the Company to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to the exploration of minerals in the State of Nevada and the United States Federal agencies. 
 
 United States 
 
 Mining in the State of Nevada is subject to federal, state and local law. Three types of laws are of particular importance to the Company s U.S. mineral properties: those affecting land ownership and mining rights; those regulating mining operations; and those dealing with the environment. 
 
 Land Ownership and Mining Rights. 
 
 On Federal Lands, mining rights are governed by the General Mining Law of 1872 (General Mining Law) as amended, 30 U.S.C. 21-161 (various sections), which allows the location of mining claims on certain Federal Lands upon the discovery of a valuable mineral deposit and proper compliance with claim location requirements. A valid mining claim provides the holder with the right to conduct mining operations for the removal of locatable minerals, subject to compliance with the General Mining Law and Nevada state law governing the staking and registration of mining claims, as well as compliance with various federal, state and local operating and environmental laws, regulations and ordinances. As the owner or lessee of the unpatented mining claims, the Company has the right to conduct mining operations on the lands subject to the prior procurement of required operating permits and approvals, compliance with the terms and conditions of any applicable mining lease, and compliance with applicable federal, state, and local laws, regulations and ordinances. 
 
 Mining Operations 
 
 The exploration of mining properties and development and operation of mines is governed by both federal and state laws. 

Page 14 of 24

Table of Contents 

The State of Nevada likewise requires various permits and approvals before mining operations can begin, although the state and federal regulatory agencies usually cooperate to minimize duplication of permitting efforts. Among other things, a detailed reclamation plan must be prepared and approved, with bonding in the amount of projected reclamation costs. The bond is used to ensure that proper reclamation takes place, and the bond will not be released until that time. The Nevada Department of Environmental Protection, which is referred to as the NDEP, is the state agency that administers the reclamation permits, mine permits and related closure plans on the Nevada property. Local jurisdictions (such as Eureka County) may also impose permitting requirements (such as conditional use permits or zoning approvals). 
 
 Environmental Law 
 
 The development, operation, closure, and reclamation of mining projects in the United States requires numerous notifications, permits, authorizations, and public agency decisions. Compliance with environmental and related laws and regulations requires us to obtain permits issued by regulatory agencies, and to file various reports and keep records of the Company s operations. Certain of these permits require periodic renewal or review of their conditions and may be subject to a public review process during which opposition to the Company s proposed operations may be encountered. The Company is currently operating under various permits for activities connected to mineral exploration, reclamation, and environmental considerations. Unless and until a mineral resource is proved, it is unlikely Star Gold Corp. operations will move beyond the pre-development stage. If in the future the Company decides to proceed beyond exploration, there will be numerous notifications, permit applications, and other decisions to be addressed at that time. 
 
 Competition 
 
 Star Gold Corp. competes with other mineral resource exploration and development companies for financing and for the acquisition of new mineral properties and for equipment and labor related to exploration and development of mineral properties. Many of the mineral resource exploration and development companies with whom the Company competes have greater financial and technical resources. Accordingly, competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquisitions of mineral properties of merit, on exploration of their mineral properties and on development of their mineral properties. In addition, they may be able to afford greater geological expertise in the targeting and exploration of mineral properties. This competition could result in competitors having mineral properties of greater quality and interest to prospective investors who may finance additional exploration and development. This competition could adversely impact Star Gold Corp. s ability to finance further exploration and to achieve the financing necessary for the Company to develop its mineral properties. 
 
 The Company provides no assurance it will be able to compete in any of its business areas effectively with current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures faced by the Company will not have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and operating results. 
 
 Office and Other Facilities 
 
 Star Gold Corp. currently maintains its administrative offices at 1875 N. Lakewood Drive, Suite 303, Coeur d Alene, ID 83814. The telephone number is (208) 664-5066. Star Gold Corp. does not currently own title to any real property. 
 
 Employees 
 
 The Company has no employees as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Star Gold Corp. conducts business largely through independent contractor agreements with consultants. 
 
 Research and Development Expenditures 
 
 The Company has not incurred any research expenditures since incorporation. 
 
 Reports to Security Holders 
 
 The Registrant does not issue annual or quarterly reports to security holders other than the annual Form 10-K and quarterly Forms 10-Q as electronically filed with the SEC. Electronically filed reports may be accessed at www.sec.gov .

PLAN OF OPERATION 
 
 The Company maintains a corporate office in Coeur d Alene, Idaho. This is the primary administrative office for the Company and is utilized by Board Chairman Lindsay Gorrill and Chief Financial Officer Kelly Stopher. 
 
 The drilling permit granted from the Bureau of Land Management BLM in September 2019 expired in December 2022. The permit allowed the Company to commence drilling mainly for the Hydrology Study but also enabling drilling of other holes on the Main knob for geochemical analysis. A bond has been obtained and there are no impediments to drilling other than capital constraints. The Company will apply for an extension of the permit. 
 
 For the fiscal year ending April 30, 2025, the Company plans to commence the following activities as it prepares to draft its Environmental Impact Statement EIS on the Longstreet Project: 
 
 Hydrology Drilling 2 to 4 holes expected to be sufficient: 
 
 Geochemical analysis design of program for submission to State of Nevada involves some core drilling; 
 
 Plan of Operations Development (Mine Plan, Civil Engineering Design) 
 
 Assuming the results of the above-referenced activities are favorable, the Company intends to proceed to the preparation of an EIS and plan of operation for the Longstreet project (the Longstreet Plan ). The eventual objective of the EIS and Longstreet Plan is the issuance, by each respective governing agency, of the necessary mine permits to authorize the construction of, and ongoing operations at, an open pit/heap leach mine at the Longstreet Property. 
 
 Approval of the Longstreet Plan is subject to governmental agency review and may require additional remediation activities. 
 
 Management believes it can source additional capital in the investment markets in the coming months and years. The Company may also consider other sources of funding, including potential mergers, sale of property, joint ventures and/or farm-out a portion of its exploration properties. 
 
 Future liquidity and capital requirements depend on many factors including timing, cost and progress of the Company s exploration efforts. The Company will consider additional public offerings, private placement, mergers or debt instruments. 
 
 Additional financing will be required in the future to complete all necessary steps to apply for a final permit. Although the Company believes it will be able to source additional financing there are no guarantees any needed financing will be available at the time needed or on acceptable terms, if at all. If the Company is unable to raise additional financing when necessary, it may have to delay exploration efforts or property acquisitions or be forced to cease operations. Collaborative arrangements may require the Company to relinquish rights to certain of its mining claims.

(11,777) 

As of July 31, 2024, the Company had cash on hand of 14,400. Since inception, the sole source of financing has been sales of the Company s debt and equity securities. Star Gold Corp. has not attained profitable operations and its ability to pursue any future plan of operation is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing. 
 
 Star Gold Corp. anticipates continuing to rely on sales of its debt and/or equity securities to continue to fund ongoing operations. Issuances of additional shares of common stock may result in dilution to the Company s existing stockholders. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete any additional sales of equity securities or that it will be able arrange for other financing to fund its planned business activities. 
 
 The Company s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations on a timely basis, to obtain additional financing as may be required, or ultimately to attain profitability. Potential sources of cash, or relief of demand for cash, include additional external debt, the sale of shares of the Company s common stock or alternative methods such as mergers or sale of the Company s assets. No assurances can be given, however, that the Company will be able to obtain any of these potential sources of cash. The Company currently requires additional cash funding from outside sources to sustain existing operations and to meet current obligations and ongoing capital requirements. 
 
 The Company plans for the long-term continuation as a going concern include financing future operations through sales of our equity and/or debt securities and the anticipated profitable exploitation of the Company s mining properties. These plans may also, at some future point, include the formation of mining joint ventures with senior mining company partners on specific mineral properties whereby the joint venture partner would provide the necessary financing in return for equity in the property. 
 
 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
 
 The Company has no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to its stockholders.

ITEM 4. 
 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Conclusions of Management Regarding Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 At the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the President and Principal Executive Officer PEO and Principal Financial Officer PFO ), of the effectiveness of the design and operations of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a 15(e) and Rule 15d 15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, the PEO and the PFO have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as it was determined that there were material weaknesses affecting our disclosure controls and procedures. 
 
 Management of the Company believes that these material weaknesses are due to the small size of the Company s accounting staff. The small size of the Company s accounting staff may prevent adequate controls in the future, such as segregation of duties, due to the cost/benefit of such remediation. To mitigate the current limited resources and limited employees, we rely heavily on direct management oversight of transactions, along with the use of external legal and accounting professionals. As the Company grows, management expects to increase the number of employees, which will enable us to implement adequate segregation of duties within the internal control framework. 
 
 PEO and PFO Certifications 
 
 Appearing immediately following the Signatures section of this report there are Certifications of the PEO and the PFO. The Certifications are required in accordance with Section 03 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Section 302 Certifications). The Items of this report which you are currently reading is the information concerning the Evaluation referred to in Section 302 Certifications and this information should be read in conjunction with Section 302 Certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no changes during the quarter ended July 31, 2024 in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal controls over financial reporting.
