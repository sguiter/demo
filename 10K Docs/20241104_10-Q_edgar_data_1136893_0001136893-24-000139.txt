Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, all references to "FIS," "we," "our," "us," the "Company" or the "registrant" are to Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., a Georgia corporation, and its subsidiaries.

On January 31, 2024, the Company completed the previously announced sale ("the Worldpay Sale") of a equity interest in its Worldpay Merchant Solutions business to private equity funds managed by GTCR, LLC (such funds, the "Buyer"). FIS retains a non-controlling ownership interest in a new standalone joint venture, Worldpay Holdco, LLC ("Worldpay"), following the closing of the Worldpay Sale. FIS' share of the net income (loss) of Worldpay is reported as equity method investment earnings (loss), net of tax. The net cash proceeds received by FIS, net of estimated closing adjustments and transaction costs, are presented as investing cash flows within continuing operations on the consolidated statement of cash flows. See Note 4 for information regarding the equity method investment earnings (loss), net of tax, for the period from February 1, 2024, through September 30, 2024. 
 
 During the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company analyzed quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to the Worldpay Merchant Solutions disposal group in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 205-20 and determined that the accounting criteria to be classified as held for sale were met, when a definitive purchase agreement was signed. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of the disposal group are presented separately on the consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented. In addition, the disposition represents a strategic shift that will have a major impact on the Company's operations and financial results. As a result, the operating results of the Worldpay Merchant Solutions business prior to the closing of the Worldpay Sale have been reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented and, as such, have been excluded from continuing operations and segment results. 
 
 The Worldpay Merchant Solutions business included the former Merchant Solutions segment, in addition to a business previously included in the Corporate and Other segment, which have been reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Accordingly, the Company no longer reports the Merchant Solutions segment; it now reports its financial performance based on the following segments: Banking Solutions ("Banking"), Capital Market Solutions ("Capital Markets") and Corporate and Other. As a result of its ongoing portfolio assessments, the Company reclassified certain non-strategic operations from Banking to Corporate and Other during the quarter ended December 31, 2023. The Company recast all prior-period segment information presented to reflect these reclassifications. See Note 13 for more information regarding our segments. 
 
 Certain reclassifications have been made in the 2023 consolidated financial statements to conform to the classifications used in 2024. The consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, is presented on a continuing operations basis, with summarized cash flows from discontinued operations for operating, investing and financing activities shown separately. The consolidated statement of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, has been reclassified to conform to the 2024 presentation.

 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a billion loss on assets held for sale related to the Worldpay Merchant Solutions reporting unit to reduce its carrying value to its estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell, primarily as a result of the exclusion of certain deferred tax liabilities that were not expected to be transferred in the transaction. This amount was subsequently updated until the closing of the Worldpay Sale. 
 
 Upon closing of the Worldpay Sale, a loss on sale of disposal group of million was recorded to reduce the carrying value of the disposal group to an updated estimate of its fair value less cost to sell. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, an additional million estimated loss on sale was recorded to reflect the impact of estimated post-closing adjustments, reflecting a cumulative estimated loss on sale of million. Upon closing of the Worldpay Sale, t he Company also recorded a tax benefit of million, primarily from the release of U.S. deferred tax liabilities that were not transferred in the Worldpay Sale, net of the estimated U.S. tax cost that the Company expects to incur as a result of the Worldpay Sale. The estimated U.S. tax cost remains unchanged from the amount recorded as of March 31, 2024, based on available data and management determinations as of September 30, 2024. Final p ost-closing selling price adjustments, including any related to the expected transfer of our Worldpay Brazil and RealNet subsidiaries, and completion of other purchase agreement provisions in connection with the Worldpay Sale could result in further adjustments to the loss on sale amount and the estimated U.S. tax cost.

 of Worldpay. This investment is reflected in Equity method investment on our September 30, 2024, consolidated balance sheet. During the eight-month period from February 1, 2024, through September 30, 2024, the Company's share of the net income of Worldpay and our investor-level tax impact is reported as Equity method investment earnings (loss), net of tax, in the consolidated statement of earnings (loss).

 Continuing Involvement with Discontinued Operations and Related-Party Transactions 
 
 In connection with the closing of the Worldpay Sale, the Company entered into a limited liability company operating agreement (the "LLCA") with respect to Worldpay, and a registration rights agreement with respect to the Company's retained equity interest in Worldpay. The LLCA provides that FIS has the right to appoint a minority of the board of managers of Worldpay and that FIS has customary consent and consultation rights with respect to certain material actions of Worldpay, in each case, subject to ownership stepdown thresholds. The LLCA contains, among other things, covenants and restrictions relating to other governance, liquidity and tax matters, including non-solicitation and noncompetition covenants, distribution mechanics, preemptive rights and follow-on equity funding commitments of the Buyer, and restrictions on transfer and associated tag-along and drag-along rights. Each of FIS and the Buyer will have the right to require Worldpay to consummate an initial public offering ("IPO") or sale transaction after the fourth anniversary of the closing, subject to certain return hurdles and (in the case of an IPO) public float requirements, which requirements will fall away following the sixth anniversary of the closing. 
 
 We have continuing involvement with Worldpay, primarily through our remaining interest, an employee leasing agreement ("ELA"), a transition services agreement ("TSA"), and various other commercial agreements. Under the terms of the ELA, which was substantially completed by July 1, 2024, the Company leased certain employees to Worldpay in the United States, China, Colombia and South Korea. The compensation and benefit costs paid by the Company for the leased employees was billed to and reimbursed by Worldpay. Under the terms of the TSA, the Company is procuring certain third-party services on behalf of Worldpay and providing technology infrastructure, risk and security, accounting and various other corporate services to Worldpay for a period of up to months after the closing, subject to a extension, and Worldpay is providing various corporate services to the Company, allowing it to maintain access to certain resources transferred in the Worldpay Sale. 
 
 During the three- and eight-month periods ended September 30, 2024, pass-through costs of million and million, respectively, were incurred under the ELA, and third-party pass-through costs of million and million, respectively, were incurred under the TSA, and were netted against the equal and offsetting reimbursement amounts due from Worldpay. Additionally, during the three- and eight-month periods ended September 30, 2024, net TSA services income of million and million, respectively, was recognized in Other operating (income) expense, net - related party, with approximately two-thirds of the corresponding expense recorded in Cost of revenue and the remainder recorded in Selling, general and

million and million, respectively. 
 
 For the three- and eight-month periods ended September 30, 2024, we collected net cash of million and million, respectively, related to the ELA, TSA and commercial agreements with Worldpay. As of September 30, 2024, we recorded a receivable of million in Receivable from related party on the consolidated balance sheet in connection with the TSA and commercial agreements. Under the TSA and commercial agreements, amounts are generally invoiced monthly in arrears and are payable by electronic transfer within days of invoice. As of September 30, 2024, we recorded a settlement payable of million in Current liabilities held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet for amounts to be settled from our RealNet subsidiary to Worldpay. The settlement payable by RealNet to Worldpay is generally paid to Worldpay's submerchants on behalf of Worldpay via ACH within five business days according to payment instructions provided by Worldpay. As of September 30, 2024, we also recorded other payables to Worldpay of million in Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. These amounts are generally payable within days. 
 
 Prior to the Worldpay Sale, the Company issued standby letters of credit and made parental guarantees (collectively "Guarantees") in the ordinary course of its business to various counterparties on behalf of certain former subsidiaries included in the Worldpay Sale, including a guarantee of a liability that a Worldpay subsidiary owes to the former owners of Worldpay Group plc (the CVR Liability ). FIS and Worldpay have agreed to maintain these Guarantees through January 31, 2026, affording Worldpay time to arrange for alternatives to the Guarantees. Worldpay s aggregate amount of borrowing capacity under the standby letters of credit guaranteed by FIS is million. As of September 30, 2024, there were no amounts outstanding under the standby letters of credit. As of September 30, 2024, Worldpay s CVR liability was million and is due on October 12, 2027. The maximum potential amount of future payments under the other remaining Guarantees cannot be estimated due to the conditional nature of the Company's obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each agreement. As of September 30, 2024, there are no amounts drawn under any of the Guarantees. In the event a Worldpay subsidiary were to default on a performance obligation covered by the Guarantees, the Company could be required to make payment or be subject to claims; however, in any such case, Worldpay is required under the terms of the agreement governing the Worldpay Sale to fully reimburse and indemnify the Company. The Company considers the likelihood of incurring a loss under the Guarantees to be remote, and no amounts have been accrued with respect to these Guarantees.

 voting and financial interest in Virtus with interest retained by the founders of Virtus (the "Founders"). The agreement between FIS and the Founders provided FIS with a call option to purchase, and the Founders with a put option requiring FIS to purchase, all of the Founders' retained interest in Virtus at a redemption value determined pursuant to performance goals stated in the agreement, exercisable at any time after and , respectively, following the acquisition date. In January 2023, the Founders exercised their put option, and as a result, FIS paid the million redemption value, recorded as a financing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and subsequently owns of Virtus.

 Goodwill 
 
 Goodwill attributable to acquisitions Foreign currency adjustments Balance, September 30, 2024 
 
 We assess goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment. We evaluated whether events and circumstances as of September 30, 2024, indicated potential impairment of our reporting units. 
 
 For our Banking and Capital Markets reporting units, we performed a qualitative assessment by examining factors most likely to affect our reporting units' fair values. The factors examined involve use of management judgment and included, among others, (1) forecast revenue, growth rates, operating margins, and capital expenditures used to calculate estimated future cash flows, (2) future economic and market conditions and (3) FIS' market capitalization. Based on our interim impairment assessment as of September 30, 2024, we concluded that it remained more likely than not that the fair value continues to exceed the carrying amount for each of these reporting units; therefore, goodwill was not impaired. Given the substantial excess of fair value over carrying amounts, we believe the likelihood of obtaining materially different results based on a change of assumptions to be low.

 Fair Value of Debt 
 
 The fair value of the Company's long-term debt is estimated to be approximately million and million lower than the carrying value, excluding the fair value basis adjustments due to interest rate swaps and unamortized discounts, as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 million, million and million at September 30, 2024, and million, million, and million at December 31, 2023. Prior to the quarter ended September 30, 2023, these swaps were designated as fair value hedges for accounting purposes, converting the interest rate exposure on certain of the Company's Senior USD Notes, Senior GBP Notes and Senior Euro Notes, as applicable, from fixed to variable. While designated as fair value hedges, changes in fair value of these interest rate swaps were recorded as an adjustment to long-term debt. During the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the Company de-designated these swaps as fair value hedges. As a result of the de-designations, the final fair value basis adjustments recorded through the dates of de-designation as a decrease of the long-term debt are subsequently amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the remaining periods to maturity of the respective long-term debt. We amortized million and million of these balances as Interest expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and amortized million as Interest expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 (see Note 9). During the quarter ended March 31, 2024, million of unamortized fair value basis adjustments recorded as a decrease of the long-term debt tendered was written-off and recorded as part of the loss on extinguishment of debt (see Note 9). The remaining unamortized fair value basis adjustments recorded as a decrease of the long-term debt totaled million and million at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Concurrently with the de-designations described above, the Company entered into new offsetting variable-to-fixed interest rate swaps with aggregate notional amounts of million, million and million. At September 30, 2024, the aggregate notional amounts remaining are million, million and . The Company accounts for the de-designated fixed-to-variable and offsetting variable-to-fixed interest rate swaps as economic hedges; as such, effective as of the de-designation dates, changes in interest rates associated with the variable leg of the interest rate swaps do not affect the interest expense recognized, eliminating variable-rate risk on the fixed-to-variable interest rate swaps. The terms of the new interest rate swaps when matched against the terms of the existing fixed-to-variable interest rate swaps result in a net fixed coupon spread payable by the Company. The impact of the go-forward changes in fair values of the new and existing interest rate swaps, including the impact of the coupons, is recorded as Other income (expense), net pursuant to accounting for economic hedges and totaled ) million for the three months and ) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The coupon payments are recorded within Cash flows from investing activities from continuing operations on the consolidated statements of cash flows and totaled million in cash outflows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The new and existing interest rate swap fair values totaled assets of million and million and liabilities of ) million and ) million as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the Company entered into an aggregate notional amount of million fixed-for-fixed cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to foreign currency risk associated with its Senior Euro Notes. During the quarter ended June 30, 2023, the Company entered into an aggregate notional amount of million fixed-for-fixed cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to foreign currency risk associated with its Senior GBP Notes. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges for accounting purposes. During March 2024, the Company partially terminated certain fixed-for-fixed cross-currency interest rate swaps that were hedging foreign currency risk associated with its Senior GBP Notes that were partially tendered (see Note 9). After such partial termination, there remained an aggregate notional amount of approximately million in fixed-for-fixed cross-currency interest rate swaps that hedge the Company's

million and million recorded at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. Changes in the swap fair values attributable to changes in spot foreign currency exchange rates are recorded in Other income (expense), net and totaled million for the three months and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and ) million and ) million, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. This amount offset the impact of changes in spot foreign currency exchange rates on the Senior GBP Notes and Senior Euro Notes also recorded to Other income (expense), net during the hedge period. Changes in swap fair values attributable to excluded components, such as changes in fair value due to forward foreign currency exchange rates and cross-currency basis spreads, are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive earnings (loss) ("AOCI"). The Company recorded ) million for the three months and ) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and million for the three months and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, through Other comprehensive earnings (loss) for the changes in swap fair values attributable to excluded components. The amounts recorded in AOCI generally affect net earnings (loss) through Interest expense using the amortization approach. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, million and million, respectively, and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, was recognized as Interest expense using the amortization approach. As a result of the partial terminations during March 2024, the Company received million in net proceeds recorded within Other financing activities, net on the consolidated statement of cash flows and recorded a million reduction to the loss on extinguishment of debt due to reclassifying the amount of AOCI related to the partially terminated hedges into earnings (see Note 9). 
 
 Net Investment Hedges 
 
 The purpose of the Company's net investment hedges, as discussed below, is to reduce the volatility of FIS' net investment value in its Euro- and Pound Sterling-denominated operations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Changes in fair value due to remeasurement of the effective portion are recorded as a component of AOCI for net investment hedges. The amounts included in AOCI for the net investment hedges will remain in AOCI until the complete or substantially complete liquidation of our investment in the underlying foreign operations. Any ineffective portion of these hedging instruments impacts net earnings when the ineffectiveness occurs. The Company assesses effectiveness of cross-currency interest rate swap hedging instruments using the spot method. Under this method, the periodic interest settlements are recorded directly in earnings through Interest expense (see Note 9). 
 
 The Company recorded net investment hedge aggregate gain (loss) for the change in fair value and related income tax (expense) benefit within Other comprehensive earnings (loss), net of tax, on the consolidated statements of comprehensive earnings (loss) for its designated net investment hedges as follows (in millions). No ineffectiveness has been recorded on the net investment hedges.) ) Cross-currency interest rate swap designations ) ) ) Total ) ) ) 
 
 Foreign Currency-Denominated Debt Designations 
 
 The Company has designated certain foreign currency-denominated debt as net investment hedges of its investment in Euro-denominated operations. An aggregate of million and million of Senior Euro Notes with maturities ranging from 2024 to 2025 was designated as a net investment hedge of the Company's investment in Euro-denominated operations as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. An aggregate of million and million of ECP Notes was also designated as a net investment hedge of the Company's investment in Euro-denominated operations as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 The Company held and million aggregate notional amount of foreign currency forward contracts as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively, to economically hedge its exposure to foreign currency risk associated with Senior Euro Notes and ECP Notes that were previously de-designated as net investment hedges. The foreign currency forward contract fair values totaled a net liability of and a net asset of million at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. Upon maturity of the forward contracts, the Company records the net proceeds paid or

million in net proceeds. The change in fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts is recorded as Other income (expense), net pursuant to accounting for economic hedges and offsets the impact of the change in spot foreign currency exchange rates on the de-designated Senior Euro Notes and ECP Notes, which is also recorded as Other income (expense), net. 
 
 Cross-Currency Interest Rate Swap Designations 
 
 The Company holds cross-currency interest rate swaps designated as net investment hedges of its investment in Euro- and Pound Sterling-denominated operations. As a result of the Worldpay Sale, the Company terminated its outstanding cross-currency interest rate swaps designated as net investment hedges of its investment in Pound Sterling-denominated operations on January 31, 2024.

There are potentially additional claims against Transpev/Prosegur for which Servicos is named as a co-defendant or may be named but for which Servicos has not yet been served. These additional claims amount to approximately million, making the total potential exposure for all claims approximately million. We do not believe a liability for these total claims is probable and, therefore, have not recorded a liability for any of these claims. 
 
 Indemnifications and Warranties 
 
 The Company generally indemnifies its clients, subject to certain limitations and exceptions, against damages and costs resulting from claims of patent, copyright, or trademark infringement associated solely with its customers' use of the Company's solutions. Historically, the Company has not made any material payments under such indemnifications but continues to monitor the conditions that are subject to the indemnifications to identify whether it is probable that a loss has occurred, in which case it would recognize any such losses when they are estimable. In addition, the Company warrants to customers that its software operates substantially in accordance with the software specifications. Historically, no material costs have been incurred related to software warranties, and no accruals for warranty costs have been made.

 Revision of Prior-Period Consolidated Financial Statements 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we identified immaterial misstatements affecting the Company s previously issued consolidated financial statements as of and for the annual periods ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the quarterly periods ended March 31 and June 30, 2024. The misstatements related primarily to the timing of the recognition of expenses associated with inventory-related accruals, along with their related balance sheet impacts, and the presentation of certain value-added tax balances in the consolidated financial statements. We have revised our prior-period financial statements to correct these misstatements as well as other unrelated immaterial misstatements, including adjustments to Revenue and Other income (expense), net. The revisions ensure comparability across all periods reflected herein. A summary of the revisions to the previously reported financial statements is provided in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.

base and addressable markets.

 Worldpay Sale Summary 
 
 On January 31, 2024, the Company completed the previously announced sale (the "Worldpay Sale") of a 55 equity interest in its Worldpay Merchant Solutions business to private equity funds managed by GTCR, LLC (such funds, the "Buyer"). Following the closing of the Worldpay Sale, we retain a non-controlling 45 ownership interest in a new standalone joint venture, Worldpay Holdco, LLC ("Worldpay"), which will continue to provide merchant acquiring and related services to businesses of all sizes and across any industry globally, enabling them to accept, authorize and settle electronic payment transactions. In connection with the Worldpay Sale, FIS and Worldpay have entered into commercial agreements, preserving a key value proposition for clients of both businesses and reducing potential dis-synergies. FIS and Worldpay also entered into additional agreements as described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Business Trends and Conditions 
 
 Revenue Sources and Markets 
 
 Our revenue from continuing operations is primarily derived from a combination of technology and processing solutions, transaction processing fees, professional services and software license fees. While we are a global company and do business around the world, the majority of our revenue is generated by clients in the U.S. The majority of our international revenue is generated by clients in the U.K., Germany, Canada, Australia, Brazil and Switzerland. In addition, the majority of our revenue has historically been recurring and has been provided under multi-year Banking and Capital Markets contracts that contribute relative stability to our revenue stream. These solutions, in general, are considered critical to our clients' operations. Professional services revenue is typically non-recurring, though recognition often occurs over time rather than at a point in time. Sales of software licenses are typically non-recurring with point-in-time recognition and are less predictable. 
 
 Economic Trends 
 
 Lengthy sales cycles continue to persist during 2024, which we believe results from economic uncertainty. We also experienced, and continue to experience, relatively high rates of inflation in our primary markets, including increasing wage and benefits rates, which management believes is in part due to inflation and in part due to competitive job markets for the skilled employees who support our businesses, as well as increasing non-labor-related costs. The magnitude of future effects of economic uncertainty, including lengthy sales cycles, and inflation is difficult to predict, although these factors have had an adverse effect on our results of operations and, to the extent they persist, may continue to have a negative effect. However, as a provider of outsourced solutions, we benefit from multi-year recurring revenue streams, which help moderate the effects of broader year-to-year economic and market changes that otherwise might have a larger impact on our results of operations. Relatively high interest rates have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our interest expense. However, during the first nine months of 2024, we used a portion of the net proceeds from the Worldpay Sale to repay our borrowings under our commercial paper programs and reduce our long-term debt, which has decreased and will continue to decrease our interest expense from previous levels. Impacts of foreign currency fluctuations remained slightly favorable during the first nine months of 2024. Given the volatility of exchange rates and the mix of currencies involved in both revenues and expenses, the direction and magnitude of future effects of currency fluctuations are uncertain. The combined effect of the factors noted above has slowed our revenue growth rate. Over the longer term, we are targeting improvements in our revenue growth rate and margins to the extent of improving economic conditions and in response to planned management actions, including our cost savings initiatives. 
 
 Worldpay Sale 
 
 On January 31, 2024, the Company completed the Worldpay Sale for cash consideration in a transaction valuing the Worldpay Merchant Solutions business at an enterprise value of 18.5 billion, including 1.0 billion of consideration contingent on the returns realized by Buyer exceeding certain thresholds. The net cash proceeds received by FIS at the closing were greater than 12 billion, net of estimated closing adjustments, debt restructuring fees, taxes and transaction costs. We used a portion of the proceeds from the sale to retire debt and repurchase shares, and we plan to continue to use the remaining proceeds to return additional capital to shareholders through our existing share repurchase authorization, as well as for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, while maintaining an investment grade credit rating. In connection with the sale, FIS and Worldpay have entered into commercial agreements, preserving a key value proposition for clients of both businesses and minimizing potential

dis-synergies. FIS and Worldpay also entered into additional agreements as described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. Upon closing of the Worldpay Sale, we retained a non-controlling 45 ownership interest in Worldpay. FIS' share of the net income of Worldpay is now reported as Equity method investment earnings (loss), net of tax. 
 
 As a result of the Worldpay Sale, we recorded an estimated loss on sale of 491 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Upon closing of the Worldpay Sale, t he Company also recorded a tax benefit of 991 million, primarily from the release of U.S. deferred tax liabilities that were not transferred in the Worldpay Sale, net of the estimated U.S. tax cost that the Company expects to incur as a result of the Worldpay Sale. Final p ost-closing selling price adjustments, including any related to the expected transfer of our Worldpay Brazil and RealNet subsidiaries, and completion of other purchase agreement provisions in connection with the Worldpay Sale could result in further adjustments to the loss on sale amount and the estimated U.S. tax cost. 
 
 Investments in Innovation 
 
 We continue to assist financial institutions and other businesses in migrating to outsourced integrated technology solutions to improve their profitability and address increasing and ongoing regulatory requirements. We believe our integrated solutions and outsourced services are well-positioned to address this outsourcing trend across the markets we serve. 
 
 We continue to invest in modernization, innovation and integrated solutions to meet the demands of the markets we serve and compete with global banks, financial and other technology providers, and emerging technology innovators. We invest both internally and through investment opportunities in companies building complementary technologies in the financial services space. Our internal development activities have related primarily to the modernization of our proprietary core systems in each of our segments, design and development of next-generation digital and innovative solutions and development of processing systems and related software applications and risk management platforms. We expect to continue to invest an appropriate level of resources to maintain, enhance and extend the functionality of our proprietary systems and existing software applications, to develop new and innovative software applications and systems to address emerging technology trends in response to the needs of our clients, and to enhance the capabilities of our outsourcing infrastructure. 
 
 Digital One Platform 
 
 Consumer preference continues to shift from traditional branch banking services to digital banking solutions, and our clients seek to provide a single integrated banking experience through their branch, mobile, internet and voice banking channels. We have been providing our large regional banking customers in the U.S. with Digital One, an integrated digital banking platform, and are now adding functionality and offering Digital One to our community bank clients to provide a consistent, omnichannel experience for consumers of banking services across self-service channels like mobile banking and online banking, as well as supporting channels for bank staff operating in bank branches and contact centers. The uniform customer experience extends to support a broad range of financial services including opening new accounts, servicing of existing accounts, money movement, and personal financial management, as well as other consumer, small business and commercial banking capabilities. Digital One is integrated into several of the core banking platforms offered by FIS and is also offered to customers of non-FIS core banking systems. 
 
 Banking Industry Consolidation 
 
 Consolidation within the banking industry has occurred and may continue, primarily in the form of merger and acquisition activity among financial institutions, which we believe would broadly be detrimental to the profitability of the financial technology industry. However, consolidation resulting from specific merger and acquisition transactions may be beneficial to our business. When consolidations of financial institutions occur, merger partners often operate systems obtained from competing service providers. The newly formed entity generally makes a determination to migrate its core and payments systems to a single platform. When a financial institution processing client is involved in a consolidation, we may benefit by their expanding the use of our solutions if such solutions are chosen to survive the consolidation and to support the newly combined entity. Conversely, we may lose revenue if we are providing solutions to both entities, or if a client of ours is involved in a consolidation and our solutions are not chosen to support the newly combined entity. It is also possible that larger financial institutions resulting from consolidation may have greater leverage in negotiating terms or could decide to perform in-house some or all of the solutions that we currently provide or could provide. We seek to mitigate the risks of consolidations by offering other competitive solutions to take advantage of specific opportunities at the surviving company. 
 
 U.S. bank failures could negatively impact our results to the extent more of our customers become illiquid; however, our current exposure to past bank closures is limited, and we may be a long-term beneficiary of these closures. As a leading provider of financial technology services to the top 100 U.S. banks by asset size as well as other global financial institutions, 
 37 

Table of Contents 

FIS boasts a highly diversified customer base, with no single customer accounting for more than approximately 2 of 2023 revenue from continuing operations. With respect to U.S. financial institution customers that closed during 2023, FIS expects to continue to provide services for the majority of these banks, and our revenue exposure from potential contract terminations related to these banks is not material. Further, FIS' core banking customer contracts are generally structured with fees that increase based on the number of active accounts or transactions rather than the amount of deposits. Thus, to the extent account volume increases, we are positioned to benefit from this growth as a leading core banking services provider to large financial institutions. 
 
 Demand in Payments Market 
 
 We continue to see demand in the payments market for innovative solutions that will deliver faster, more convenient payment options in mobile channels, internet applications, in-store cards, and digital currencies. The payment processing industry is adopting new technologies, developing new solutions, evolving new business models, and is being affected by new market entrants and by an evolving regulatory environment. As financial institutions respond to these changes by seeking solutions to help them enhance their own offerings to consumers, including the ability to accept card-not-present payments in eCommerce and mobile environments, as well as contactless cards and mobile wallets at the point of sale, FIS believes that payment processors will seek to develop additional capabilities in order to serve clients' evolving needs. To facilitate this expansion, we believe that payment processors will need to enhance their technology platforms so they can deliver these capabilities and differentiate their offerings from other providers. 
 
 We believe that these market changes present both an opportunity and a risk for us, and we cannot predict which emerging technologies or solutions will be successful. However, FIS believes that payment processors, like FIS, that have scalable, integrated business models, provide solutions across the payment processing value chain and utilize broad distribution capabilities will be best-positioned to enable emerging alternative electronic payment technologies in the long term. Further, FIS believes that its depth of capabilities and breadth of distribution will enhance its position as emerging payment technologies are adopted by merchants and other businesses. FIS' ability to partner with non-financial institution enterprises, such as mobile payment providers and internet, retail and social media companies, continues to create attractive growth opportunities as these new entrants seek to become more active participants in the development of alternative electronic payment technologies and to facilitate the convergence of retail, online, mobile and social commerce applications. 
 
 Cybersecurity Threats and Solutions 
 
 Cyberattacks on information technology systems and the vendors and technological supply chain on which they rely continue to grow in frequency, complexity and sophistication. This is a trend we expect to continue. The continued growth in the frequency, complexity and sophistication of cyberattacks presents both a threat and an opportunity for FIS. Using expertise we have gained from our ongoing focus and investment, we have developed and we offer fraud, security, risk management and compliance solutions to target this growth opportunity in the financial services industry. We also use certain of these solutions to manage our own risks. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Revenue 
 
 Revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased primarily due to strong recurring revenue growth in the Banking and Capital Markets segments. Revenue was not materially impacted by foreign currency movements versus the prior year period. See "Segment Results of Operations" below for a more detailed explanation. 
 
 Cost of Revenue, Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin 
 
 Cost of revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased due to variable transaction processing and hosting expenses, partially offset by lower intangible asset amortization resulting primarily from using accelerated amortization methods which apply a declining rate over time. Gross profit margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024, declined due to dis-synergies associated with the Worldpay Sale. Gross profit margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased due to high-margin non-recurring license revenue and lower intangible asset amortization, partially offset by dis-synergies associated with the Worldpay Sale. 
 
 Selling , General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased primarily due to higher acquisition, integration and other costs and increased corporate costs, which were slightly higher year over year due to dis-synergies associated with the Worldpay Sale, offset for the most part by other cost saving initiatives. 
 
 Asset Impairments 
 
 The three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, included impairments primarily related to the termination of certain internally developed software projects. 
 
 Other operating (income) expense, net - related party 
 
 As described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, under the terms of the TSA, the Company is providing technology infrastructure, risk and security, accounting and various other corporate services to Worldpay. The amount is recorded in Other operating (income) expense, net - related party, and the corresponding expense was recognized in Cost of revenue and Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of earnings (loss). 
 
 Operating Income and Operating Margin 
 
 The change in operating income and operating margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, resulted from the revenue and cost variances noted above.

 The decrease in interest expense, net during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to a reduction in our outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper programs and senior notes using a portion of the net proceeds from the Worldpay Sale and increased interest income generated on the proceeds of the Worldpay Sale. 
 
 Other income (expense), net for the periods presented consists of various income and expense items outside of the Company's operating activities, including foreign currency transaction remeasurement gains and losses; realized and unrealized gains and losses on equity security investments, including impairment losses on these investments; and fair value adjustments on certain non-operating assets and liabilities, including certain derivatives, as further described in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. The three-month period ended September 30, 2024, included primarily losses of 35 million on the Company s offsetting interest rate swaps, as discussed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. The three-month period ended September 30, 2023, included primarily foreign currency transaction remeasurement gains offset by (10) million of losses on equity security investments without readily determinable fair values as discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. The nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, included loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately (174) million, as discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. The nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, included (44) million of net gains (losses) on equity security investments without readily determinable fair values, as discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, in addition to foreign currency transaction remeasurement losses.

 The increase in the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was predominately driven by increases to income tax on foreign operations. As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company reflects its investor-level tax impact relating to equity method investments as a component of Equity method investment earnings (loss), net of tax in the consolidated statement of earnings (loss). Therefore, equity method investment earnings (loss) and the related investor-level tax are excluded from the calculation of FIS' estimated annual effective tax rate.

 As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed the Worldpay Sale on January 31, 2024. The results of the Worldpay Merchant Solutions business prior to the completion of the Worldpay Sale have been presented as discontinued operations. 
 
 As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, certain businesses included in the Worldpay Sale have yet to be conveyed to Worldpay due to pending regulatory approvals; these businesses continue to generate an immaterial amount of revenue and earnings from discontinued operations. For the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, changes in each of the captions above are a result of the Worldpay Sale. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations related to major classes of pretax earnings (loss), as well as Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, included a 6.8 billion impairment of goodwill. Additionally, beginning on July 5, 2023, the Company ceased amortization of long-lived assets held for sale. 
 
 An initial loss on sale of disposal group of 466 million was recorded upon closing of the Worldpay Sale to reflect the impact of the excess of the carrying value of the disposal group over the estimated fair value less cost to sell. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, an additional 25 million estimated loss on sale was recorded to reflect the impact of estimated post-closing adjustments, reflecting a cumulative estimated loss on sale of 491 million. 
 
 For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 , the Company recorded a tax benefit of 991 million , primarily from the write-off of U.S. deferred tax liabilities that were not transferred in the Worldpay Sale, net of the estimated U.S. tax cost that the Company expects to incur as a result of the Worldpay Sale. 
 
 Post-closing selling price adjustments and completion of other purchase agreement provisions in connection with the Worldpay Sale could result in further adjustments to the loss on sale amount and the estimated U.S. tax cost.

Adjusted EBITDA is reported to our chief operating decision maker, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and President, for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to the segments and assessing their performance. For this reason, Adjusted EBITDA, as it relates to our segments, is presented in conformity with FASB ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting . Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net earnings (loss) before net interest expense, net other income (expense), income tax provision (benefit), equity method investment earnings (loss), and depreciation and amortization, and excludes certain costs that do not constitute normal, recurring, cash operating expenses necessary to operate our business. The items affecting the segment profit measure generally include purchase price amortization of acquired intangible assets, as well as acquisition, integration and certain other costs and asset impairments. These costs and adjustments are recorded in the Corporate and Other segment for the periods discussed below. Adjusted EBITDA for the respective segments excludes the foregoing costs and adjustments. Financial information, including details of Adjusted EBITDA, for each of our segments is set forth in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Cash Requirements 
 
 Our principal ongoing cash requirements include operating expenses, income taxes, debt service payments, capital expenditures, stockholder dividends, working capital and timing differences in settlement-related assets and liabilities and may include discretionary debt repayments, share repurchases and business acquisitions. Our principal sources of funds are cash generated by operations and borrowings, including the capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility, the U.S. commercial paper program and the Euro-commercial paper program discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, in addition to the net proceeds from the Worldpay Sale, which closed on January 31, 2024. 
 
 43 

Table of Contents 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 5.7 billion of available liquidity, including 1.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents and 4.4 billion of capacity available under its Revolving Credit Facility. Approximately 750 million of cash and cash equivalents is held by our foreign entities. A portion of our domestic cash and cash equivalents relates to net deposits-in-transit, which are typically settled within a few business days. Debt outstanding totaled 10.9 billion, with an effective weighted average interest rate of 2.7 . The Company repaid an aggregate principal amount of 500 million in 1.100 Senior Euro Notes at maturity on July 15, 2024. 
 
 Although we continue to evaluate the optimal capital structure for our business following the completion of the Worldpay Sale, we intend to maintain investment grade debt ratings for FIS. 
 
 We believe that our current level of cash and cash equivalents plus cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our operating cash requirements, capital expenditures and debt service payments for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. 
 
 A regular quarterly dividend of 0.36 per common share is payable on December 23, 2024, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 9, 2024. We currently expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends at a target payout ratio consistent with our capital allocation strategy, without regard to our equity method investment earnings (loss) attributable to our interest retained in Worldpay post-separation. However, the amount, declaration and payment of future dividends is at the discretion of the Board of Directors and depends on, among other things, our investment opportunities (including potential mergers and acquisitions), results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, and other factors, including legal and contractual restrictions, that may be considered relevant by our Board of Directors. Additionally, the payment of cash dividends may be limited by covenants in certain debt agreements. 
 
 In January 2021, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program under which it authorized the Company to repurchase up to 100 million shares of our common stock. In August 2024, our Board of Directors approved a separate, incremental share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to 3.0 billion in aggregate value of shares of our common stock. Repurchases under these programs will be made at management's discretion from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions and through Rule 10b5-1 plans. Neither of these repurchase programs has an expiration date, and either program may be suspended for periods, amended or discontinued at any time. Approximately 13 million shares remained available for repurchase under the January 2021 program as of September 30, 2024, and the Company will exhaust its authorization under this program prior to repurchasing shares under the new program. We plan to continue to prioritize share repurchases under these share repurchase authorizations. We intend to repurchase approximately 4.0 billion of our shares during 2024, inclusive of 3.0 billion in shares repurchased during the first nine months of 2024. 
 
 Cash Flows from Operations 
 
 Our net cash provided by operating activities consists primarily of net earnings, adjusted to add back depreciation and amortization and other non-cash items, including asset impairments, loss on extinguishment of debt, and loss from equity method investment. Cash flows from operations were 1,393 million and 1,301 million for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash flows from operations increased 92 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to an increase in earnings adjusted for non-cash items, partially offset by timing of working capital. 
 
 Cash Flows from Investing 
 
 Our principal investing activity relates to capital expenditures for software (purchased and internally developed) and property and equipment. We invested approximately 629 million and 584 million in capital expenditures (excluding other financing obligations for certain hardware and software) during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We expect to continue investing in software and in property and equipment to support our business. 
 
 We also invest in acquisitions that complement and extend our existing solutions and capabilities and provide additional solutions to our portfolio, and we dispose of assets that are no longer considered strategic. In the first nine months of 2024, we used approximately 56 million of cash (net of cash acquired) related to new acquisitions. In 2024, in connection with the Worldpay Sale, we received approximately 12.8 billion in cash proceeds and divested 3.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash included in current assets held for sale at the date of sale. We expect to continue to invest in acquisitions as part of our strategy to add solutions to help win new clients and cross-sell to existing clients. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received distributions of 40 million from Worldpay recorded as investing cash flows. We expect to continue to receive regular cash distributions from Worldpay pursuant to the terms of the LLCA.

Cash flows from investing also occasionally include cash received or paid relative to other activities that are not regularly recurring in nature.

Table of Contents 

Cash Flows from Financing 
 
 Cash flows from financing principally involve borrowing funds, repaying debt, repurchasing shares and paying dividends. In 2023, we paid 173 million related to the 2020 Virtus acquisition to redeem a put option exercised by the founders as described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Financing 
 
 For more information regarding the Company's debt and financing activity, see "Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Indebtedness" in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February 26, 2024, and "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk" in Item 3 below as well as Notes 9 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 
 There were no material changes in our contractual obligations through the three months ended September 30, 2024, in comparison to the table included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, except as disclosed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 No new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had or is expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Market Risk 
 
 We are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We periodically use certain derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts, to manage interest rate and foreign currency risk. We do not use derivatives for trading purposes, to generate income or to engage in speculative activity. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 In addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by operating activities, we use fixed-rate and variable-rate debt to finance our operations. We are exposed to interest rate risk on these debt obligations. 
 
 Our fixed rate senior notes (as included in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements) represent the majority of our fixed-rate long-term debt obligations as of September 30, 2024. The carrying value, excluding the fair value basis adjustments due to interest rate swaps described below and unamortized discounts, of our senior notes was 11.1 billion as of September 30, 2024. The fair value of our senior notes was approximately 10.4 billion as of September 30, 2024. The potential reduction in fair value of the senior notes from a hypothetical 10 increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt. 
 
 Our variable-rate risk principally relates to borrowings under our U.S. commercial paper program, Euro-commercial paper program, and Revolving Credit Facility (as included in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements) (collectively, "variable-rate debt"). At September 30, 2024, our weighted-average cost of debt was 2.7 , with a weighted-average maturity of 6.7 years, and 99 of our debt was fixed rate. A 100 basis-point increase in the weighted-average interest rate on our variable-rate debt as of September 30, 2024, would have increased our annual interest expense by 1 million. We performed the foregoing sensitivity analysis based solely on the outstanding balance of our variable-rate debt as of September 30, 2024. This sensitivity analysis does not take into account any changes that occurred in the prior 12 months or that may take place in the next 12 months in the amount of our outstanding debt. Further, this sensitivity analysis assumes the change in interest rates is applicable for an entire year. For comparison purposes, based on the outstanding balance of our variable-rate debt as of September 30, 2023, and calculated in the same manner as set forth above, an increase of 100 basis points in the weighted-average interest rate would have increased our annual interest expense by approximately 48 million.

Table of Contents 

Foreign Currency Risk 
 
 We are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations. These risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries, transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a location's functional currency. We may manage the exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the use of foreign currency forward contracts and non-derivative and derivative instruments. 
 
 Our exposure to foreign currency exchange risks generally arises from our non-U.S. operations, to the extent they are conducted in local currency. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect translations of revenue denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. We generated approximately 323 million and 304 million during the three months, and 922 million and 908 million during the nine months, ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, in revenue denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. The major currencies to which our revenue is exposed are the British Pound Sterling, Euro, Brazilian Real, Australian Dollar, Swedish Krona and Indian Rupee. A 10 movement in average exchange rates for these currencies (assuming a simultaneous and immediate 10 change in all of such rates for the relevant period) would have resulted in the following increase or decrease in our reported revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in millions): Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, Currency 2024 2023 2024 2023 Pound Sterling 11 10 32 29 Euro 7 6 19 18 Real 3 3 9 11 Australian Dollar 2 2 6 5 Swedish Krona 3 2 6 6 Rupee 1 1 4 5 Total increase or decrease 27 24 76 74 
 
 While our results of operations have been impacted by the effects of currency fluctuations, our international operations' revenue and expenses are generally denominated in local currency, which reduces our economic exposure to foreign exchange risk in those jurisdictions. 
 
 Our foreign exchange risk management policy permits the use of derivative instruments, such as forward contracts and options, to reduce volatility in our results of operations and/or cash flows resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. We do not enter into foreign currency derivative instruments for trading purposes or to engage in speculative activity. We do periodically enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge foreign currency exposure to intercompany loans, other balance sheet items or expected foreign currency cash flows resulting from forecasted transactions. The Company also utilizes foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency interest rate swaps designated as net investment hedges in order to reduce the volatility of the net investment value of certain of its Euro and Pound Sterling functional subsidiaries and utilizes cross-currency interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges in order to mitigate the impact of foreign currency risk associated with our foreign currency-denominated debt (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements). 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (a) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms and (b) accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

In August 2024, our Board of Directors approved a separate, incremental share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to 3.0 billion in aggregate value of shares of our common stock. Repurchases under these programs will be made at management's discretion from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions and through Rule 10b5-1 plans. Neither of these repurchase programs has an expiration date, and either program may be suspended for periods, amended or discontinued at any time. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 13.2 million shares remained available for repurchase under the January 2021 program, and the Company will exhaust its authorization under this program prior to repurchasing shares under the new program.

Right to Appeal If a claim for payment of Severance Benefits made in accordance with the procedures specified in this Plan is denied, in whole or in part, the Claimant shall have the right to request that the Plan Administrator review the denial, provided that the Claimant files a written request for review with the Plan Administrator within 60 days after the date on which the Claimant received written notification of the denial. The Claimant may review or receive copies, upon request and free of charge, of any documents, records or other information relevant (within the meaning of Department of Labor Regulation 2560.503-1(m)(8)) to the Claimant s claim. The Claimant may also submit written comments, documents, records and other information relating to his or her claim. 
 
 d. Review of Appeal In deciding a Claimant s appeal, the Plan Administrator shall take into account all comments, documents, records and other information submitted by the Claimant relating to the claim, without regard to whether such information was submitted or considered in the initial review of the claim. If the Claimant does not provide all the necessary information for the Plan Administrator to decide the appeal, the Plan Administrator may request additional information and set deadlines for the Claimant to provide that information. Within 60 days after a request for review is received, the review shall be made and the Claimant shall be advised in writing of the decision on review, unless special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the review, in which case the Claimant shall be given a written notification within such initial 60 day period specifying the reasons for the extension and when such review 
 10 

shall be completed (provided that such review shall be completed within 120 days after the date on which the request for review was filed). 
 
 e. Notice of Appeal Determination The decision on review shall be forwarded to the Claimant in writing and, in the case of a denial, shall include (i) specific reasons for the decision, (ii) specific references to the pertinent Plan provisions upon which the decision is based, (iii) a statement that the Claimant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records or other information relevant to the Claimant s claim and (iv) a statement of the Claimant s right to bring a civil action under Section 502(a) of ERISA following a wholly or partially denied claim for benefits. The Plan Administrator s decision on review shall be final and binding on all persons for all purposes. If a Claimant shall fail to file a request for review in accordance with the procedures herein outlined, such Claimant shall have no right to review and shall have no right to bring an action in any court, and the denial of the claim shall become final and binding on all persons for all purposes. Any notice and decisions by the Plan Administrator under this Section 12 may be furnished electronically in accordance with Department of Labor Regulation 2520.104b-1(c)(i), (iii) and (iv). 
 
 f. Demand for Arbitration If the Participant subsequently wishes to submit an arbitration claim under the Plan pursuant to Section 16 hereof, the demand for arbitration must be made within ninety (90) days after the Plan Administrator s final decision. No demand for arbitration shall be brought to recover benefits under the Plan unless and until the claims procedure rights herein provided have been exhausted and the Plan benefits requested in such claims process have been finally denied in whole or in part. 
 
 13. Offsets 
 
 a. Non-duplication of Benefits The Company may, in its discretion and to the extent permitted under applicable law, offset against the Participant s Severance Benefits under this Plan any other severance, termination, end of service gratuity, compensation for non-competition commitments (whether paid during the term of employment or post-termination), or similar benefits or amounts payable to the Participant by the Company or any of its Affiliates, including, but not limited to any amounts paid under any offer letter, employment agreement or other individual contractual arrangement, amounts paid pursuant to federal, state, or local workers notification or office closing requirements, or statutory severance benefits or payments made on account of any notice period (including but not limited to payments made in lieu of notice or for periods during which the Participant is released from further duties) as provided under any offer letter, employment agreement or other individual contractual arrangement or pursuant to the law of any country or political subdivision thereof. 
 
 b. Offsets and Property Subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Company also may, in its discretion and to the extent permitted under applicable law, offset against the Severance Benefits under this Plan the value of unreturned property and any amounts the Participant owes to the Company or its Affiliates. 
 11 

c. Overpayment The Company may recover any overpayment of Severance Benefits made to a Participant or a Participant's estate under this Plan or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, offset any other overpayment made to the Participant against any Severance Benefits or other amount the Company owes the Participant or the Participant's estate. 
 
 14. Acceptance Deemed. By accepting the Severance Benefits under the Plan, each Participant and each person claiming under or through any such Participant shall be conclusively deemed to have indicated acceptance and ratification of, and consent to, all of the terms and conditions of the Plan and any action taken under the Plan by the Plan Administrator or the Company or its Affiliates, in any case in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Plan. 
 
 15. Successors. The Plan shall bind any successor of the Company, its assets or its businesses (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise), in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be obligated under the Plan if no succession had taken place. In the case of a Change in Control or any transaction in which a successor would not by the foregoing provision or by operation of law be bound by this Plan, the Company shall require such successor expressly and unconditionally to assume and agree to perform the Company s obligations under the Plan in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place. 
 
 The Plan shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Participant s personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributes, and or legatees. The rights under the Plan are personal in nature and neither the Company nor any Participant shall, without the consent of the other, assign, transfer or delegate any rights or obligations hereunder except as expressly provided in this Section. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Participant s right to receive any benefits hereunder shall not be assignable, transferable or delegable, whether by pledge, creation of a security interest or otherwise, other than by a transfer by his or her will or by the laws of descent and distribution and, in the event of any attempted assignment or transfer contrary to this Section, the Company shall have no liability to pay any amount so attempted to be assigned, transferred or delegated. 
 
 16. Resolutions of Disputes. Other than disputes arising under Section 9 hereof (which a party may enforce through legal process), any other controversies arising out of or relating to the validity, interpretation, enforceability, or performance of the Plan, including any claim by a Participant for benefits hereunder, will be solely and finally settled by means of binding arbitration in Jacksonville, Florida. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the applicable employment dispute resolution rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration will be final, conclusive and binding upon the parties. All arbitrator s fees and related expenses shall be divided equally between the parties. 
 
 In the case of a dispute subject to arbitration with respect to a termination occurring outside of the Change in Control Protection Period, the arbitrator may award reasonable attorneys fees and expenses to the prevailing party, including attorneys fees the 
 12 

prevailing party incurs in connection with the appeal or the enforcement of an arbitration award. Any award of attorneys fees and expenses to the prevailing party shall be paid within sixty (60) days following the award of such fees and costs by the arbitrator. 
 
 17. Withholding. The Company shall have the right to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable under the Plan such federal, state, local or other taxes as are required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation. 
 
 18. Notice. For the purpose of the Plan, notices and all other communications provided for in this Plan shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when actually delivered or mailed by United States registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed to the Chief Legal Officer (or, in the case of an initial request for review pursuant to Section 12 hereof, to the Plan Administrator) at the Company s corporate headquarters address, and to the Participant at the last address of the Participant on the Company s books and records. 
 
 19. Governing Law. Except to the extent preempted by federal law, the provisions of the Plan shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida without regard to the conflict of law provisions thereof. 
 
 20. Validity and Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of the Plan shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of the Plan, which shall remain in full force and effect, and any prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction, shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. 
 
 21. Headings Interpretation. Headings in the Plan are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not to be considered in the construction of the provisions hereof. Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the masculine pronoun wherever used herein shall be construed to include the feminine pronoun. 
 
 22. Section 409A. It is intended that the payments and benefits provided under the Plan shall be exempt from the application of the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and each payment hereunder shall be considered a separate payment. The Plan shall be construed, administered and governed in a manner that effects such intent, and the Plan Administrator shall not take any action that would be inconsistent with such intent. Specifically, any taxable benefits or payments provided under this Plan are intended to be separate payments that qualify for the short-term deferral exception to Section 409A of the Code to the maximum extent possible, and to the extent they do not so qualify, are intended to qualify for the separation pay exceptions to Section 409A of the Code, to the maximum extent possible. To the extent that none of these exceptions (or any other available exception) applies, then notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, and to the extent required to comply with Section 409A of the Code, if a Participant is a specified employee, as determined under the Company s policy for identifying specified employees on the date of his or her Qualifying Termination, then all amounts due under the Plan that constitute a deferral of compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, that are provided as a result of a separation from service within the meaning of Section 
 13 

409A of the Code, and that would otherwise be paid or provided during the first six months following the date of termination, shall be accumulated through and paid or provided on the first business day that is more than six months after the date of the date of termination (or, if the Participant dies during such six-month period, within 90 days after the Participant s death). To the extent that any payment constitutes a deferral of compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and is conditioned on the execution and non-revocation of a Release and the period to consider and revoke such Release spans two tax years, then the amounts conditioned upon such Release shall be payable in the later of the two tax years. 
 
 With regard to any provision herein that provides for reimbursement of costs and expenses or in-kind benefits, except as permitted by Section 409A of the Code (i) the right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit (ii) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits, provided during any calendar year shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, in any other calendar year and (iii) such payments shall be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the expense occurred, or such earlier date as required hereunder. 
 
 The payments and benefits provided under this Plan may not be deferred, accelerated, extended, paid out or modified in a manner that would result in the imposition of an additional tax under Section 409A of the Code upon Participants. The tax treatment of the benefits provided under this Plan is not warranted or guaranteed to the Participants. Neither the Company, its Affiliates nor their respective directors, officers, Employees or advisers shall be held liable for any taxes, interest, penalties or other monetary amounts owed by a Participant (or any other individual claiming a benefit through the Participant) as a result of this Plan. In the event of a Change in Control which does not constitute a transaction described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5)(v), (vi) or (vii), the payment schedule applicable to a Qualifying Termination outside of a Change in Control Protection Period shall apply to the extent necessary to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A and the regulations thereunder. 
 
 23. Unfunded Plan Status. The Plan shall be unfunded and is intended to provide benefits to a select group of management and highly compensated Employees. All payments pursuant to the Plan shall be made from the general funds of the Company and no special or separate fund shall be established or other segregation of assets made to assure payment. No Participant or other person shall have under any circumstances any interest in any particular property or assets of the Company as a result of participating in the Plan. 
 
 24. Plan Termination and Amendment. The Board reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan at any time, in its sole discretion, without prior notice to Participants except to the extent required by this Section 24. Any such amendment or termination shall be made by the Board or by action of a person or persons duly authorized by the Board, including the Compensation Committee. All Participants who have experienced a Qualifying Termination prior to the termination of the Plan shall receive any benefits to which they have become entitled 
 14 

under the Plan on or before the date the Plan terminates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) an amendment or termination that eliminates any Participant or reduces benefits payable under the Plan or changes a Participant s participation level will not be effective until one (1) year after written notice is provided to the Participants affected by such amendment or termination, (ii) an amendment, termination or change in participation level that eliminates any Participant or reduces benefits payable under the Plan will not be effective if (x) the Company has entered into a definitive agreement which, if consummated, would result in a Change in Control unless such definitive agreement terminates pursuant to its terms or (y) a Change in Control occurs during the one (1) year notice period, and (iii) an amendment or termination or change in participation level that eliminates any Participant or reduces benefits payable under the Plan will not be effective if it is adopted during a Change in Control Protection Period.
