Since January 2010, all apparel manufactured in
Jordan can be exported to the U.S. without customs duty being imposed, pursuant to the United States-Jordan Free Trade Agreement entered
into in December 2001. This free trade agreement provides us with substantial competitiveness and benefit that allowed us to expand our
garment export business in the U.S. 

The increase of approximately 18 in sales to
the U.S. during the three months ended September 30, 2024, was mainly attributable to more shipments delivered to our major customers
in the U.S. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, aggregate sales to China, Germany, Jordan, and other locations increased by 38 from
 4.1 million to 5.7 million from the same period last year. This increase was mainly due to higher demands of our production facility
in the period. 

Cost of goods sold . Following the
increase in sales revenue, our cost of goods sold increased by approximately 5.2 million, or 19 , to approximately 33.2 million, for
the three months ended September 30, 2024, from approximately 28.0 million for the same period in fiscal 2024. As a percentage of revenue,
the cost of goods sold decreased by approximately two percentage points, from 84 for the same period in fiscal 2024 to 82 for the three
months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in the cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue was primarily attributable to economy
of scale resulting from higher production volume and more shipments. 

26 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024,
we purchased 10 of our total purchase in garments and raw materials from one major supplier. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2023,
we did not have a major supplier for our garments and raw materials. 

Gross profit margin. Gross
profit margin was approximately 18 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which increased by two percentage points from approximately
16 for the same period in fiscal 2024. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily driven by higher production volume with more
orders shipped to the U.S. that typically generate higher margin. 

Operating expenses. Operating
expenses increased by 32 , or approximately 1.4 million, from approximately 4.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023,
to approximately 5.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to higher export logistic
costs to catch up with garment shipment schedules of customers, higher shipment volume and more stock-based compensation expenses in the
second quarter of fiscal 2025. 

Other expenses, net. Other
expenses, net were approximately 364,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to other expenses, net of approximately
 167,000 for the same period in fiscal 2024. The increase was primarily due to higher interest expenses from customers 
supply chain financing programs and bank financing to support raw material purchases for the shipments in the latter half of the fiscal
year. 

Income tax expenses. Income
tax expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were approximately 106,000 compared to income tax expenses of approximately
 352,000 for the same period in fiscal 2024. The decrease in the income tax expenses was mainly due to the reduced operating profit derived
from our Jordan subsidiaries and improvement in Hong Kong subsidiaries. The effective tax rate declined to 13.7 for the three months
ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 48.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Net income. Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was approximately
 0.7 million compared to net income of approximately 0.4 million for the same period in fiscal 2024. The increase in net income was mainly
attributable to the increase in gross profit and the decrease in income tax expenses.

Since January 2010, all apparel manufactured in
Jordan can be exported to the U.S. without customs duty being imposed, pursuant to the United States-Jordan Free Trade Agreement entered
into in December 2001. This free trade agreement provides us with substantial competitiveness and benefit that allowed us to expand our
garment export business in the U.S. 

28 

The increase of approximately 16 in sales to the U.S. during the six
months ended September 30, 2024, was mainly attributable to the increase of shipment to one of our major customers in the U.S. with some
customers we obtained during the past two years. 

During the six months ended September 30, 2024, aggregate sales to China, Germany, Jordan, and other locations increased by 55 from approximately
 6.2 million to 9.6 million from the same period last year as we were diversifying our customer bases to different geographic locations. 

Cost of goods sold . Following the
increase in sales revenue, our cost of goods sold increased by approximately 12.3 million, or 22 , to approximately 69.5 million, for
the six months ended September 30, 2024, from approximately 57.2 million for the same period in fiscal 2024. As a percentage of revenue,
the cost of goods sold increased by approximately 2 points to 86 for the six months ended September 30, 2024 from 84 for the same period
in fiscal 2024. The increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue was primarily attributable to the higher import logistic
costs and more overtime work incurred in the first quarter to catch up with the garment delivery schedules of customers. 

For the six months ended September 30, 2024 and
2023, we purchased 11 of our garments and raw materials from one major supplier. 

Gross profit margin. Gross profit
margin was approximately 14 for the six months ended September 30, 2024, which decreased by 2 points from 16 for the same period in
fiscal 2024. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily driven by higher logistic costs and over time work incurred in the first
quarter to catch up with garment delivery schedules of customers. 

Operating expenses. Operating expenses
for the six months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 27 , or approximately 2.4 million, to approximately 11.4 million, compared
to the same period in fiscal 2024. The increase was primarily due to higher export logistic costs from more sales in the period and higher
stock-based compensation expenses in fiscal 2025. 

Other expenses, net. Other expenses,
net was approximately 790,000 for the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to other expenses, net of approximately 466,000
for the same period in fiscal 2024. The increase was primarily due to higher interest expenses from customers supply chain financing
programs. 

Income tax expenses. Income tax
expenses for the six months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 0.2 million compared to income tax expenses of approximately
 0.7 million for the same period in fiscal 2024. The decrease in the income tax expenses was mainly due to the reduced operating profit
derived from our Jordan subsidiaries. The effective tax rate was declined to (44.9 for the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared
to 42.9 for the six months ended September 30, 2023. 

Net (loss)/income. Net loss for the six months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately
 0.7 million compared to net income of approximately 0.9 million for the same period in fiscal 2024. The decrease in net income was mainly
attributable to a decrease in profit margin due to the higher logistic costs amid the Red Sea turmoil and additional production costs
to catch up with customers delivery schedules, as well as the higher stock-based compensation expenses during the period in fiscal
2025.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Jerash Holdings is a holding company incorporated
in Delaware. As a holding company, we rely on dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries formed in Jordan and Hong Kong to
satisfy our liquidity requirements. Current Jordanian regulations permit our Jordanian subsidiaries to pay dividends to us only out of
their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with Jordanian accounting standards and regulations. In addition, our Jordanian
subsidiaries are required to set aside at least 10 of their respective accumulated profits each year, if any, to fund certain reserve
funds. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. We have relied on direct payments of expenses by our subsidiaries to meet
our obligations to date. The subsidiaries generate most of revenue in our group. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had cash of approximately
 16.3 million and restricted cash of approximately 1.5 million compared to cash of approximately 12.4 million and restricted cash of
approximately 1.6 million as of March 31, 2024. The increase in total cash was mainly a result of more sales in the six-month period
and a higher credit facility balance. 

Our current assets as of September 30, 2024 were
approximately 51.6 million and our current liabilities were approximately 16.4 million, which resulted in a ratio of approximately 3.1
to 1. Our current assets as of March 31, 2024 were approximately 50.9 million, and our current liabilities were approximately 14.8 million,
which resulted in a current ratio of approximately 3.4 to 1. 

The primary drivers in the increase in current
assets were the increase in cash from more sales in the six-month period. The primary driver in the increase in current liabilities was
the increase in credit facilities balance. 

Total equity as of September 30, 2024 was approximately
 63.5 million compared to 64.4 million as of March 31, 2024. 

We had net working capital of 35.2 million and
 36.1 million as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. Based on our current operating plan, we believe that cash on
hand and cash generated from operating activities will be sufficient to support our working capital needs for the next 12 months from
the date this Quarterly Report is released. 

Since May and October 2021, we have participated
in supply chain financing programs of two of our major customers, respectively. The programs allow us to receive early payments for approved
sales invoices submitted by us through the bank the customer cooperates with. For any early payments received, we are subject to an early
payment charge imposed by the customer s bank, for which the rate is SOFR plus a spread. The arrangement allows us to have better
liquidity without the need to incur administrative charges and handling fees as in bank financing. In March 2024, we participated in an
additional supply chain financing program with one customer. 

We have funded our working capital needs from
our operations. Our working capital requirements are influenced by the level of our operations, the numerical and dollar volume of our
sales contracts, the progress of execution on our customer contracts, and the timing of accounts receivable collections. 

Credit Facilities 

DBS Facility Letter 

Pursuant to the DBS facility letter dated January
12, 2022, DBSHK provided a bank facility of up to 5.0 million to Treasure Success, which was amended pursuant to a facility letter dated
January 4, 2024. Pursuant to the amended agreement, DBSHK agreed to finance cargo receipt, trust receipt, account payable financing, and
certain types of import and export invoice financing up to an aggregate of 5.0 million, subject to certain financial covenants. The DBSHK
facility bears interest at 1.5 per annum over HIBOR for HKD bills and 1.1 to 1.3 per annum over DBSHK s cost of funds for foreign
currency bills. The facility is guaranteed by Jerash Holdings and became available to the Company on June 17, 2022. As of September 30,
2024 and March 31, 2024, we had 3.6 million and nil outstanding under this DBSHK facility, respectively.

Operating Activities 

Net cash provided by operating activities was
approximately 2.4 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to cash provided by operating activities of approximately
 8.2 million for the same period in fiscal 2024. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable
to the following factors: 

a
decrease in inventory of 7.0 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a decrease of 13.9 million in the same
period in fiscal 2024; 

an
increase in accounts receivable of 0.4 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to an increase of 2.9 million in
the same period in fiscal 2024; 

an
increase in advance to suppliers of 2.9 million compared to an increase of 1.9 million in the same period in fiscal 2024; 

a
decrease in accounts payable of 1.9 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a decrease of 1.5 million in the
same period in fiscal 2024; and 

a
net loss of 0.7 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024, from net income of 0.9 million in the same period in fiscal 2024. 

Investing Activities 

Net cash used in investing activities was approximately 0.9 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately
 3.5 million in the same period in fiscal 2024. The net cash used in investing activities during the six months ended September 30, 2024
was mainly for investment in property, plant, and machinery and construction of a dormitory. The net cash used in investing activities
in the six months ended September 30, 2023 was mainly used in investment in property, plant, and machinery including the ongoing construction
of a dormitory and factory expansion. 

Financing Activities 

Net cash provided by financing activities was
approximately 2.3 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, which was the net effect of proceeds from the DBSHK facility of
approximately 3.6 million and the payments of 1.2 million of dividend. Net cash used in financing activities was approximately 1.2
million for the six months ended September 30, 2023, which was dividend payments in the period. 

Statutory Reserves 

In accordance with the corporate law in Jordan,
subsidiaries of Jerash Holdings in Jordan are required to make appropriations to certain reserve funds, based on net income determined
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of Jordan. Appropriations to the statutory reserve are required to be 10 
of net income until the reserve is equal to 100 of the entity s share capital. Jiangmen Treasure Success is required to set aside
10 of its net income as statutory surplus reserve until such reserve is equal to 50 of its registered capital. These reserves are not
available for dividend distribution. The statutory reserve was 0.4 million as of September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

The following table provides the amount of our
statutory reserves, the amount of restricted net assets, consolidated net assets, and the amount of restricted net assets as a percentage
of consolidated net assets, as of September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Total restricted net assets accounted for approximately
0.65 of our consolidated net assets as of September 30, 2024. As our subsidiaries in Jordan are only required to set aside 10 of net
profits to fund the statutory reserves, we believe the potential impact of such restricted net assets on our liquidity is limited. 

31 

Capital Expenditures 

We had capital expenditures of approximately 0.9
million and 3.5 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, for plant and machinery and the construction of a dormitory
in both periods. For the six months ended September 30, 2024, payments for additional plant and machinery and the construction of a dormitory
amounted to approximately 0.6 million and 0.3 million respectively. For the six months ended September 30, 2023, payments for additional
plant and machinery, and construction of a dormitory and factory expansion, amounted to approximately 0.9 million and 2.6 million, respectively. 

On August 7, 2019, we completed a transaction
to acquire 12,340 square meters (approximately three acres) of land in Al Tajamouat Industrial City, Jordan, from a third party to construct
a dormitory for our employees with aggregate purchase price JOD 863,800 (approximately 1,218,303). Management has revised the plan to
construct both dormitory and production facilities on the land in order to capture the increasing demand for our capacity. We are conducting
engineering design and study on this project with the business growth potential brought about by the new business collaboration with Busana
Apparel Group. On February 6, 2020, we completed a transaction to acquire 4,516 square meters (approximately 48,608 square feet) of land
in Al Tajamouat Industrial City, Jordan, from a third party to construct a dormitory for our employee with aggregate purchase price JOD
313,501 (approximately 442,162). The dormitory is completed in second quarter of fiscal year 2025. We have spent approximately 9.8 million
in capital expenditures to build the dormitory. The dormitory s kitchen is under construction at an estimated cost of approximately
 0.9 million. 

We project that there will be an aggregate of
approximately 4.1 million and 8.8 million of capital expenditures in the fiscal years ending March 31, 2025 and 2026, respectively,
for further enhancement of production capacity to meet future sales growth. The realization of these investments depends on the progress
of our business development, including expanding our client base and securing increased commitments from existing customers. We expect
that our capital expenditures will increase in the future as our business continues to develop and expand. We have used cash generated
from operations of our subsidiaries to fund our capital commitments in the past and anticipate using such funds to fund capital expenditure
commitments in the future. 

Off-balance Sheet Commitments and Arrangements 

We have not entered into any other financial guarantees
or other commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any third parties. In addition, we have not entered into any derivative contracts
that are indexed to our own shares and classified as stockholders equity, or that are not reflected in our consolidated financial
statements. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

We prepare our consolidated financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted by the United States of America U.S. GAAP ), which require us
to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect our reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and
any related disclosures. Although there were no material changes made to the accounting estimates and assumptions in the past three years,
we continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on the most recently available information, our own historical experience
and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Since the use of estimates is an integral component
of the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from our expectations as a result of changes in our estimates. We have
not identified any critical accounting estimates. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

See Note 3 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
in the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk . 

As a smaller reporting company, we are not required
to provide this information. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act Rule 15d-15(e)) are designed with the objective of
ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this report, is recorded, processed,
summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures are
also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

32 

Our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive
officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), based on their evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of September 30, 2024, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of that date based on reasons set
forth below. 

In the annual report for fiscal 2024 filed on
June 28, 2024, the management concluded that, as of March 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective due
to certain control deficiencies that are deemed as material weaknesses, including: 

- We
failed to maintain effective controls over period-end financial reporting, specifically related to income taxes and the reconciliation
of account level balances that resulted in errors; and 

- There
were ineffective information technology general controls in the areas of privileged user access and the review of user access over certain
information technology systems that support our financial reporting processes. 

Remedial actions have then been implemented to
address some of the issues. However, in the assessment in fiscal 2025, the management still concluded that, as of September 30, 2024,
our internal control over financial reporting was not effective due to certain material control weaknesses particularly that we failed
to maintain effective controls over period-end financial reporting related to income taxes and the reconciliation of account level balances
that resulted in errors. 

The Company has put in more resources to strengthen
the internal control environment and plans to enhance the communication with external consultants who are assisting the Company in taxation
and management information systems. As of the date of this report, we have implemented measures to address the weaknesses by: 

- Enhanced
communication with the U.S. GAAP advisor to strengthen compliance including but not limited to new promulgations. A review of the manpower
structure and workflows is also undergoing to ensure sufficient resources are available to implement identified improvement actions; 

- Improved
communication with external professional consultants to strengthen our work and review both U.S. tax and local issues in Jordan; and 

- Conducting
a comprehensive review and strengthened processes on user authorization, access log control, password control mechanism, and documentation
of control procedures for the information technology systems supporting our financial reporting processes. 

While we believe the Company s remediation
efforts to-date have improved and will continue to improve our disclosure controls and procedures, remediation of the material weaknesses
will require validation and testing of the operating effectiveness of our disclosure controls over a sustained period of financial reporting
cycles. As the Company continues to evaluate and work to improve its internal control over financial reporting, management may determine
additional measures are necessary to address control deficiencies or determine that it is necessary to modify the remediation plan described
above. Management cannot provide assurance as to when the Company will remediate such weaknesses, nor can management be certain of whether
additional actions will be required or the costs of any such actions. 

Our remediation efforts are ongoing and are subject
to continued management review supported by ongoing design and testing. Notwithstanding the material weaknesses, our management has concluded
that the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report present fairly, in all material
respects, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

Other than our ongoing remediation efforts with
respect to our disclosure controls and procedures, which extend to our internal control over financial reporting, there were no changes
in our internal control over financial reporting (as the term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during
the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.
