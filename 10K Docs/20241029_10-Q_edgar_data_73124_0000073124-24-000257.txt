 THIRD QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 General 
 The Corporation is a leading provider of wealth management, asset servicing, asset management and banking solutions to corporations, institutions, families and individuals. The Corporation focuses on managing and servicing client assets through its two client-focused reporting segments: Asset Servicing and Wealth Management. Asset management and related services are provided to Asset Servicing and Wealth Management clients primarily by the Asset Management business. Except where the context requires otherwise, the terms Northern Trust, we, us, our, its, or similar terms mean the Corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. 
 
 Overview of Financial Results 
 Net Income per diluted common share was 2.22 in the current quarter and 1.49 in the third quarter of 2023. Net Income increased 137.1 million to 464.9 million in the current quarter from 327.8 million in the prior-year quarter. Annualized return on average common equity was 15.4 in the current quarter and 11.6 in the prior-year quarter. The annualized return on average assets was 1.26 in the current quarter as compared to 0.93 in the prior-year quarter. 
 Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 242.0 million, or 14 , to 1.97 billion in the current quarter from 1.73 billion in the prior-year quarter. The current-quarter results include a 68.1 million pre-tax gain related to the sale of an equity investment (after-tax 51.4 million), partially offset by mark-to-market activity on existing Visa Class B swap agreements, including a 12.8 million expense related to litigation escrow funding, both recorded in Other Operating income. For further detail on the Visa transactions, refer to Note 20 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities. 
 Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees increased 84.7 million, or 8 , from 1.11 billion in the prior-year quarter to 1.20 billion in the current quarter, primarily due to favorable markets. 
 Other Noninterest Income increased 51.2 million, or 32 , from 158.4 million in the prior-year quarter to 209.6 million in the current quarter. The increase in Other Noninterest Income in the current quarter was primarily driven by the current quarter gain on the sale of an equity investment, partially offset by mark-to-market activity on existing Visa Class B swap agreements and a decrease in banking and credit-related service fees. 
 Net Interest Income increased 106.1 million, or 23 , to 562.3 million in the current quarter as compared to 456.2 million in the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by higher deposits, securities repositioning, and a higher than average impact of other items, partially offset by a decrease in the loan portfolio. 
 In the current quarter, there was a Provision for Credit Losses of 8.0 million, as compared to a Provision for Credit Losses of 14.0 million in the prior-year quarter. For additional information, refer to the Provision for Credit Losses within the Third Quarter Consolidated Results of Operations section. 
 Noninterest Expense increased 81.2 million, or 6 , from 1.28 billion in the prior-year quarter to 1.36 billion in the current quarter, primarily due to higher Compensation expense, higher software amortization and software support expense, higher Outside Services expense, and higher Employee Benefits expense, partially offset by a decrease in Other Operating Expense. 
 The Provision for Income Taxes in the current quarter totaled 136.2 million, representing an effective tax rate of 22.7 . The Provision for Income Taxes in the prior-year quarter totaled 106.5 million, representing an effective tax rate of 24.5 . 
 
 Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees 
 Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees are based primarily on the market value of assets held in custody, managed or serviced; the volume of transactions; securities lending volume and spreads; and fees for other services rendered. Certain market value calculations on which fees are based are performed on a monthly or quarterly basis in arrears. 
 The components of Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees are provided below.

 Asset Servicing 
 Custody and Fund Administration fees, the largest component of Asset Servicing fees, are driven primarily by values of client assets under custody/administration (AUC/A), transaction volumes and the number of accounts. The asset values used to calculate these fees vary depending on the individual fee arrangements negotiated with each client. Custody fees related to asset values are client-specific and are priced based on month-end market values, quarter-end market values, or the average of month-end market values for the quarter. The fund administration fees that are asset-value-related are priced using month-end, quarter-end, or average daily balances. Investment Management fees are based generally on market values of client AUM throughout the period. Typically, the asset values used to calculate fee revenue are based on a one-month or one-quarter lag. Securities Lending revenue is affected by market values; the demand for securities to be lent, which drives volumes; and the interest rate spread earned on the investment of cash deposited by investment firms as collateral for securities they have borrowed. The Other fee category in Asset Servicing includes such products as investment risk and analytical services, benefit payments, and other services. Revenue from these products is based generally on the volume of services provided or a fixed fee. 
 Custody and Fund Administration fees increased from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to favorable markets and favorable currency translation. Investment Management fees increased from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to favorable markets and new business. 
 Wealth Management 
 Wealth Management fee income is calculated primarily based on market values and is impacted by both one-month and one-quarter lagged asset values. Fee income in the regions increased from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to favorable markets. Global Family Office fee income increased from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to favorable markets and asset inflows.

 Other Operating Income increased compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by a 68.1 million gain on the sale of an equity investment in the current quarter, partially offset by higher expenses related to existing Visa Class B swap agreements, including 12.8 million related to litigation escrow funding in the current quarter, and a decrease in banking and credit-related service fees. 
 
 Net Interest Income 
 Net Interest Income is defined as the total of Interest Income and amortized fees on earning assets, less Interest Expense on deposits and borrowed funds, adjusted for the impact of interest-related hedging activity. Earning assets including Federal Funds Sold, Securities Purchased under Agreements to Resell, Interest-Bearing Due From and Deposits with Banks, Federal Reserve and Other Central Bank Deposits, Securities, Loans, and Other Interest-Earning Assets are financed by a large base of interest-bearing liabilities that include client deposits, short-term borrowings, Senior Notes and Long-Term Debt. Short-term borrowings include Federal Funds Purchased, Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase, and Other Borrowings. Earning assets are also funded by noninterest-bearing funds, which include demand deposits and stockholders equity. Net Interest Income is subject to variations in the level and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing funds and their relative sensitivity to interest rates. In addition, the levels of nonaccruing assets and client compensating deposit balances used to pay for services impact Net Interest Income. 
 Net interest margin is the difference between what we earn on our assets and what we pay for deposits and other sources of funding. The direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings. Net interest margin is calculated by dividing annualized Net Interest Income by average interest-earning assets. 
 Net Interest Income stated on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis is a non-generally accepted accounting principle (GAAP) financial measure that facilitates the analysis of asset yields. Management believes an FTE presentation provides a clearer indication of net interest margins for comparative purposes. When adjusted to an FTE basis, yields on taxable, nontaxable, and partially taxable assets are comparable; however, the adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on Net Income. A reconciliation of Net Interest Income on a GAAP basis to Net Interest Income on an FTE basis is provided in Reconciliation to Fully Taxable Equivalent within this MD A.

 (1) Interest-Bearing Due from and Deposits with Banks includes the interest-bearing component of Cash and Due from Banks and Interest-Bearing Deposits with Banks as presented on the consolidated balance sheets. 
 (2) Includes the impact of balance sheet netting under master netting arrangements of approximately 64.3 billion and 33.5 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Excluding the impact of netting for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the average interest rate on Securities Purchased under Agreements to Resell would be approximately 5.43 and 5.34 , respectively. Excluding the impact of netting for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the average interest rate on Securities Sold under Agreements to Repurchase would be approximately 5.34 and 5.30 , respectively. Northern Trust nets securities sold under repurchase agreements against those purchased under resale agreements when there is a legally enforceable master netting agreement. 
 (3) Average balances include nonaccrual loans. 
 (4) Other Interest-Earning Assets include certain community development investments, collateral deposits with certain securities depositories and clearing houses, Federal Home Loan Bank and Federal Reserve stock, and money market investments which are classified in Other Assets on the consolidated balance sheets.

 (1) Changes not due solely to average balance changes or rate changes are allocated proportionately to average balance and rate based on their relative absolute magnitudes. Changes due to average rates includes the impact of balance sheet netting as noted in Table 13: Average Consolidated Balance Sheets with Analysis of Net Interest Income. 
 Notes: Net Interest Income (FTE), a non-GAAP financial measure, includes adjustments to a fully taxable equivalent basis for loans, securities and other interest-earning assets. The adjustments are based on a federal income tax rate of 21.0 , where the rate is adjusted for applicable state income taxes, net of related federal tax benefit. Total taxable equivalent interest adjustments amounted to 7.1 million and 13.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. A reconciliation of Net Interest Income and net interest margin on a GAAP basis to Net Interest Income and net interest margin on an FTE basis (each of which is a non-GAAP financial measure) is provided in Reconciliation to Fully Taxable Equivalent within this MD A. Net interest margin is calculated by dividing annualized Net Interest Income by average interest-earning assets. 
 Interest Income on cash collateral positions is reported above in Interest-Bearing Due from and Deposits with Banks, Loans and in Other Interest-Earning Assets. Interest Expense on cash collateral positions is reported above in Savings, Money Market and Other and in Non-U.S. Offices Interest-Bearing Deposits. Where it can be netted, related cash collateral received from and deposited with derivative counterparties is recorded net of the associated derivative contract in Other Assets and Other Liabilities, respectively. 
 Net Interest Income, stated on an FTE basis, increased from the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by higher deposits, securities repositioning, and a higher than average impact of other items, partially offset by a decrease in the loan portfolio. Average earning assets increased from the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by an increase in deposits, partially offset by a decrease in borrowing activity. 
 Federal Reserve and Other Central Bank Deposits averaged 36.1 billion and increased 8.1 billion, or 29 , from 28.0 billion in the prior-year quarter. Interest-Bearing Due from and Deposits with Banks averaged 4.8 billion and increased 0.5 billion, or 12 , from 4.3 billion in the prior-year quarter. 
 Average Securities were 50.3 billion and decreased 0.1 billion, from 50.4 billion in the prior-year quarter. Average taxable Securities were 44.0 billion in the current quarter and 47.4 billion in the prior-year quarter. Average nontaxable Securities, which represent securities that are primarily exempt from U.S. federal and state income taxes, were 6.3 billion in the current quarter and 3.0 billion in the prior-year quarter. 
 Securities Purchased under Agreements to Resell averaged 977.2 million and increased 26.4 million, or 3 , from 950.8 million in the prior-year quarter. The increase in Securities Purchased under Agreements to Resell interest income and

 expense is primarily driven by sponsored member program activity due to increased client demand and wider spreads with the market presenting consistent opportunities to achieve higher rates. 
 Loans averaged 39.9 billion and decreased 2.3 billion, or 6 , from 42.2 billion in the prior-year quarter, primarily reflecting lower levels of Non-U.S. loans and other loans, partially offset by average loan increases in commercial and institutional, residential real estate, private client, and commercial real estate loans. Non-U.S. loans averaged 3.3 billion and decreased 126.8 million, or 4 , from 3.4 billion for the prior-year quarter. Private client loans averaged 15.8 billion and increased 1.8 billion, or 13 , from 14.0 billion for the prior-year quarter. Commercial and institutional loans averaged 14.4 billion and increased 2.0 billion, or 16 , from 12.4 billion for the prior-year quarter. Residential real estate loans averaged 6.5 billion and increased 149.4 million, or 2 , from 6.4 billion for the prior-year quarter. Commercial real estate loans averaged 5.9 billion and increased 914.0 million, or 18 , from 5.0 billion for the prior-year quarter. 
 Average Other Interest-Earning Assets include collateral deposits with certain securities depositories and clearing houses, certain community development investments, Federal Home Loan Bank stock, a money market investment, and Federal Reserve stock of 1.4 billion, 836.7 million, 342.7 million, 94.3 million, and 70.0 million, respectively, which are recorded in Other Assets on the consolidated balance sheets. 
 Northern Trust utilizes a diverse mix of funding sources. Average Interest-Bearing Deposits increased 11.2 billion, or 13 , to an average of 96.2 billion in the current quarter from 85.0 billion in the prior-year quarter. Interest expense for Interest-Bearing Deposits in the current quarter was driven by higher deposit costs. Average Non-U.S. Offices Interest-Bearing Deposits comprised 67 and 69 of total average Interest-Bearing Deposits for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Average other interest-bearing liabilities decreased 5.4 billion, or 24 , to an average of 16.8 billion in the current quarter from 22.2 billion in the prior-year quarter. The balances within short-term borrowing classifications vary based on funding requirements and strategies, interest rate levels, changes in the volume of lower-cost deposit sources, and the availability of collateral to secure these borrowings. 
 
 Provision for Credit Losses 
 In the current quarter, there was a Provision for Credit Losses of 8.0 million, as compared to a Provision for Credit Losses of 14.0 million in the prior-year quarter. The Provision for Credit Losses in the current quarter resulted from an increase in both the collective and individual reserves. The increase in collective reserves was primarily driven by a small number of downgrades and extensions in the Commercial and Institutional (C I) portfolio. The reserve evaluated on a collective basis relates to pooled financial assets sharing similar risk characteristics. The increase in individual reserves was driven by the default of one C I loan. 
 The Provision for Credit Losses in the prior-year quarter was primarily due to an increase in the reserve evaluated on a collective basis, driven by a small number of large new loans and renewals and credit quality deterioration of certain Commercial Real Estate (CRE) and C I loans, partially offset by a net improvement in the overall macroeconomic outlook. 
 Net recoveries in the current quarter were 2.4 million, reflecting 2.4 million of recoveries and de minimis charge-offs. The prior-year quarter included 0.3 million net recoveries, reflecting 1.1 million of recoveries and 0.8 million of charge-offs.

 Employee Benefits expense increased compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by higher medical costs. 
 Outside Services expense increased compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily due to an increase in consulting services. 
 Equipment and Software expense increased compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily due to higher software amortization and higher software support and rental expense. 
 Other Operating Expense decreased compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily due to a decrease in account servicing activities and the impact of reclassifying the amortization of certain investments from Other Operating Expense to the Provision for Income Taxes, in accordance with a new accounting standard that took effect in 2024. 
 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 136.2 million, representing an effective tax rate of 22.7 , compared to 106.5 million in the prior-year quarter, representing an effective tax rate of 24.5 . 
 The effective tax rate decreased compared to the prior-year quarter primarily due to higher current year benefits.

 Overview of Financial Results 
 Net Income per diluted common share increased in the current period to 7.51 from 4.56 in the prior-year period. Net Income increased 581.5 million, or 59 , to 1.58 billion in the current period from 994.2 million in the prior-year period. Annualized return on average common equity was 18.2 in the current period and 12.1 in the prior-year period. The annualized return on average assets was 1.44 in the current period compared to 0.92 in the prior-year period. 
 Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.1 billion from 5.23 billion in the prior-year period to 6.33 billion in the current period. The increase was driven by a 878.4 million net gain related to the Visa transactions in the second quarter of 2024, as well as a 68.1 million pre-tax gain related to the sale of an equity investment (after-tax 51.4 million) in the third quarter of 2024, recorded in Other Operating Income, partially offset by a 189.4 million loss on the sale of available for sale debt securities recognized in the first quarter of 2024, recorded in Investment Security Gains (Losses), net. For further detail on the Visa transactions, refer to Note 20 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities. 
 Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees increased 233.8 million, or 7 , from 3.27 billion in the prior-year period to 3.51 billion in the current period, primarily driven by favorable markets and net new business. 
 Other Noninterest Income increased 754.4 million or 165 , from 457.5 million in the prior-year period to 1.21 billion in the current period, primarily driven by the net gain related to the Visa transactions in the second quarter of 2024 as well as the current quarter gain on the sale of an equity investment, partially offset by the loss on the sale of available for sale debt securities recognized in the first quarter of 2024. 
 Net Interest Income increased 114.4 million, or 8 , from 1.5 billion in the prior-year period to 1.61 billion in the current period, primarily due to higher client deposits and securities repositioning, partially offset by higher funding costs in the first half of the year and a decrease in the loan portfolio. 
 There was a 7.5 million Provision for Credit Losses in the current period, as compared to a 13.5 million Provision for Credit Losses in the prior-year period. For additional information, refer to the Provision for Credit Losses within Third Quarter Consolidated Results of Operations section. 
 Noninterest Expense increased 362.3 million, or 9 , from 3.90 billion in the prior-year period to 4.26 billion in the current period, primarily attributable to higher severance-related charges recorded in Compensation expense, higher Other Operating Expense, higher Equipment and Software expense, and higher Outside Services expense, partially offset by lower Occupancy Expense. 
 The Provision for Income Taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 489.6 million, representing an effective tax rate of 23.7 . The Provision for Income Taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 totaled 324.8 million, representing an effective tax rate of 24.6 . 
 
 Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees 
 Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees are based primarily on the market value of assets held in custody, managed or serviced; the volume of transactions; securities lending volume and spreads; and fees for other services rendered.

 (1) Changes not due solely to average balance changes or rate changes are allocated proportionately to average balance and rate based on their relative absolute magnitudes. Changes due to average rates includes the impact of balance sheet netting as noted in Table 18: Average Consolidated Balance Sheets with Analysis of Net Interest Income. 
 Notes: Net Interest Income (FTE Adjusted), a non-GAAP financial measure, includes adjustments to a fully taxable equivalent basis for loans and securities. The adjustments are based on a federal income tax rate of 21.0 , where the rate is adjusted for applicable state income taxes, net of related federal tax benefit. Total taxable equivalent interest adjustments amounted to 21.3 million and 39.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. A reconciliation of Net Interest Income and net interest margin on a GAAP basis to Net Interest Income and net interest margin on an FTE basis (each of which is a non-GAAP financial measure) is provided in Reconciliation to Fully Taxable Equivalent within this MD A. Net interest margin is calculated by dividing annualized net interest income by average interest-earning assets. 
 Interest Income on cash collateral positions is reported above in Interest-Bearing Due from and Deposits with Banks, Loans and in Other Interest-Earning Assets. Interest Expense on cash collateral positions is reported above in Savings, Money Market and Other and in Non-U.S. Offices Interest-Bearing Deposits. Where it can be netted, related cash collateral received from and deposited with derivative counterparties is recorded net of the associated derivative contract in Other Assets and Other Liabilities, respectively. 
 Net Interest Income, stated on an FTE basis, increased from the prior-year period, primarily driven by higher deposits, securities repositioning, and a higher than average impact of other items, partially offset by higher funding costs and a decrease in the loan portfolio. Average earning assets increased from the prior-year period primarily due to higher client deposits and the proceeds from the sale of Visa shares in the second quarter of 2024. 
 The net interest margin on an FTE basis increased from the prior-year period, primarily driven by higher deposits and securities repositioning, partially offset by higher funding costs. 
 Federal Reserve and Other Central Bank Deposits averaged 36.0 billion and increased 3.0 billion, or 9 , from 33.0 billion in the prior-year period. Interest-Bearing Due from and Deposits with Banks averaged 4.7 billion in the current period and 4.4 billion in the prior-year period. 
 Average Securities were 49.6 billion and decreased 0.5 billion, or 1 , from 50.1 billion in the prior-year period. Average taxable securities were 43.7 billion in the current period and 47.1 billion in the prior-year period. Average nontaxable securities, which represent securities that are primarily exempt from U.S. federal and state income taxes, were 5.9 billion in the current period and 3.0 billion in the prior-year period. 
 Securities Purchased under Agreements to Resell averaged 743.2 million, a decrease of 335.0 million, or 31 , from 1.1 billion in the prior-year period. The increase in Securities Purchased under Agreements to Resell interest income and expense is 
 14 

NINE-MONTH CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) 
 Net Interest Income (continued) 

primarily driven by sponsored member program activity due to increased client demand and wider spreads with the market presenting consistent opportunities to achieve higher rates. 
 Loans averaged 40.8 billion and decreased 1.3 billion, or 3 , from 42.2 billion in the prior-year period, primarily reflecting lower levels of commercial and institutional, non-U.S., and residential real estate, partially offset by higher levels of commercial real estate and private loans. Commercial and institutional loans averaged 11.2 billion and decreased 1.4 billion, or 11 , from 12.6 billion for the prior-year period. Non-U.S. loans averaged 3.0 billion and decreased 462.8 million, or 13 , from 3.4 billion for the prior-year period. Residential real estate loans averaged 6.3 billion and decreased 141.3 million, or 2 , from 6.4 billion for the prior-year period. Commercial real estate loans averaged 5.3 billion and increased 384.3 million, or 8 , from 4.9 billion for the prior-year period. Private client loans averaged 14.1 billion and increased 226.7 million, or 2 , from 13.9 billion for the prior-year period. 
 Average Other Interest-Earning Assets include collateral deposits with certain securities depositories and clearing houses, certain community development investments, Federal Home Loan Bank stock, a money market investment, and Federal Reserve stock of 1.5 billion, 856.7 million, 332.5 million, 94.8 million, and 70.0 million respectively, which are recorded in Other Assets on the consolidated balance sheets. 
 Northern Trust utilizes a diverse mix of funding sources. Average Interest-Bearing Deposits increased 7.9 billion, or 9 , to an average of 96.2 billion in the current period from 88.3 billion in the prior-year period. Other average interest-related funding decreased 5.3 billion, to an average of 17.0 billion in the current period from 22.3 billion in the prior-year period. The balances within short-term borrowing classifications vary based on funding requirements and strategies, interest rate levels, changes in the volume of lower-cost deposit sources, and the availability of collateral to secure these borrowings. 
 Interest expense for Interest-Bearing Deposits in the current period was driven by higher deposit costs. Average non-U.S. offices interest-bearing deposits comprised 66 and 69 of total average interest-bearing deposits for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Provision for Credit Losses 
 There was a Provision for Credit Losses of 7.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a 13.5 million provision in the prior-year period. The provision in the current-year period was primarily due to an increase in collective reserves, partially offset by a decrease in individual reserves. The increase in collective reserves was primarily driven by a small number of downgrades and extensions in the C I portfolio and by expectations for weaker prices in the CRE portfolio. The decrease in individual reserves was driven by one C I loan charge-off in the first quarter, partially offset by the default of one C I loan in the current quarter. 
 The provision in the prior-year period was primarily due to an increase in the collective reserve, driven by new loans and renewals in the CRE portfolio and expectations of higher economic stress in the CRE market, particularly office CRE, partially offset by a net improvement in the overall macroeconomic outlook and lower loss projections for certain large C I loans. 
 Net charge-offs in the current-year period totaled 7.9 million resulting from 11.4 million of charge-offs and 3.5 million of recoveries, compared to net charge-offs of 2.6 million in the prior-year period resulting from 5.6 million of charge-offs and 3.0 million of recoveries.

NINE-MONTH CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) 
 Noninterest Expense (continued) 

Employee Benefits expense increased compared to the prior-year period, primarily driven by higher medical costs. 
 Outside Services expense increased compared to the prior-year period, primarily reflecting higher technical services and higher consulting services. 
 Equipment and Software expense increased compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to higher software disposition charges in the second quarter of 2024, as well as higher software amortization, and higher software support expense. 
 Occupancy expense decreased compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to charges of 12.8 million related to early lease exits recorded during the prior-year period. 
 Other Operating Expense increased compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to a 70.0 million charitable contribution and 10.6 million legal settlement recorded in the second quarter of 2024 and 14.7 million of additional expense related to the FDIC special assessment in the current period, partially offset by the 25.6 million charge related to the write-off of an investment in a client capability in the prior-year period. 
 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 489.6 million, representing an effective tax rate of 23.7 , compared to 324.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, representing an effective tax rate of 24.6 . 
 The effective tax rate decreased compared to the prior-year period primarily due to higher current-year benefits. 
 
 REPORTING SEGMENTS 
 Northern Trust is organized around its two client-focused reporting segments: Asset Servicing and Wealth Management. Asset management and related services are provided to Asset Servicing and Wealth Management clients primarily by the Asset Management business. The revenue and expenses of Asset Management and certain other support functions are allocated fully to Asset Servicing and Wealth Management. 
 Reporting segment financial information, presented on an internal management-reporting basis, is determined by accounting systems used to allocate revenue and expense to each segment, and incorporates processes for allocating assets, liabilities, equity and the applicable interest income and expense utilizing a funds transfer pricing (FTP) methodology. Under the methodology, assets and liabilities receive a funding charge or credit that considers interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and other product characteristics on an instrument level. Additionally, segment information is presented on an FTE basis as management believes an FTE presentation provides a clearer indication of net interest income. The adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on Net Income. 
 Revenues, expenses and average assets are allocated to Asset Servicing and Wealth Management, with the exception of non-recurring activities such as certain corporate transactions and costs incurred associated with acquisitions, divestitures, litigation, restructuring, and tax adjustments not directly attributable to a specific reporting segment, which are reported within the Other segment. 
 Effective January 2024, Northern Trust implemented certain enhancements to its FTP methodology, impacting the allocation of Net Interest Income to the Asset Servicing and Wealth Management segments. As a result, the approximate impact on the Asset Servicing and Wealth Management segments was a 36 million decrease and a 36 million increase in Net Interest Income, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The approximate impact on the Asset Servicing and Wealth Management segments was a 99 million decrease and a 99 million increase in Net Interest Income, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Prior-period segment results have not been revised to reflect this methodology change. 
 Reporting segment results are subject to reclassification when organizational changes are made. The results are also subject to refinements in revenue and expense allocation methodologies, which are typically reflected on a prospective basis. For further details, please refer to Note 9 Reporting Segments.

REPORTING SEGMENTS (continued) 

 Asset Servicing 
 Asset Servicing Net Income 
 For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, Net Income increased 37.2 million, or 23 , from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to higher Net Interest Income and Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees, partially offset by higher Noninterest Expense. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Net Income decreased 28.8 million, or 6 , from the prior-year period, primarily due to higher Noninterest Expense, partially offset by an increase in Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees. 
 Asset Servicing Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees 
 For an explanation of Asset Servicing Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees, please see the Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees section within the Consolidated Results of Operations section. 
 Asset Servicing Foreign Exchange Trading Income 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Foreign Exchange Trading Income increased 5.2 million, or 10 , from the prior-year quarter and 20.4 million, or 13 , from the prior-year period, primarily driven by higher client volumes. 
 Asset Servicing Net Interest Income 
 For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, Net Interest Income stated on an FTE basis increased 40.2 million, or 14 , from the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by deposit balances and higher spreads, partially offset by the change in reporting segment allocation methodology beginning in 2024 noted above. 
 Asset Servicing Provision for Credit Losses 
 For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there was a negative Provision for Credit Losses of 0.6 million compared to a 3.1 million Provision for Credit Losses in the prior-year quarter. The Provision for Credit Losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 reflected a decrease in the collective and individual reserves. The decrease in collective reserve was primarily in the C I portfolio. The decrease in individual reserves was driven by the paydown of one C I loan. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was a negative Provision for Credit Losses of 1.9 million compared to a 3.3 million negative Provision for Credit Losses in the prior-year period. The Provision for Credit Losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflected a decrease in the individual reserve, partially offset by an increase in the collective reserve. The decrease in individual reserves was driven by one loan moved back to the collective reserve in the first quarter and the paydown of one C I loan in the current quarter. The increase in collective reserve was primarily in the C I portfolio, driven by a small number of downgrades. 
 Asset Servicing Noninterest Expense 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Noninterest Expense, which includes the direct expense of the reporting segment, indirect expense allocations for product and operating support and indirect expense allocations for certain corporate support services, increased 51.4 million, or 6 , from the prior-year quarter primarily due to higher expense allocations, and 174.3 million, or 7 , from the prior-year period primarily due to higher severance related-charges and higher expense allocations. 
 
 Wealth Management 
 Wealth Management Net Income 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Net Income increased 54.8 million, or 31 , from the prior-year quarter and 94.8 million, or 18 , from the prior-year period, primarily due to higher Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees and higher Net Interest Income, partially offset by higher Noninterest Expense. 
 Wealth Management Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees 
 For an explanation of Wealth Management Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees, please see the Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees section within the Consolidated Results of Operations section. 
 Wealth Management Foreign Exchange Trading Income 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Foreign Exchange Trading Income decreased 5.8 million, or 92 , from the prior-year period primarily driven by lower allocations. 
 Wealth Management Other Noninterest Income 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Other Noninterest Income decreased 7.5 million, or 7 , from the prior-year period primarily due to lower credit-related fees and swap fees.

REPORTING SEGMENTS (continued) 

 Wealth Management Net Interest Income 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Net Interest Income stated on an FTE basis increased 59.8 million, or 32 , from the prior-year quarter and 98.3 million, or 15 , from the prior-year period, primarily due to the change in reporting segment allocation methodology beginning in 2024 noted above and higher deposit balances. 
 Wealth Management Provision for Credit Losses 
 For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there was a Provision for Credit Losses of 12.4 million compared to a 10.9 million Provision for Credit Losses in the prior-year quarter. The Provision for Credit Losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 resulted from increases in both collective and individual reserves. The increase in collective reserve was primarily in the C I portfolio, driven by a small number of downgrades and extensions. The increase in individual reserves was driven by the default of one C I loan. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was a Provision for Credit Losses of 15.7 million compared to a 16.8 million Provision for Credit Losses in the prior-year period. The Provision for Credit Losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflected an increase in the collective reserve, partially offset by a decrease in the individual reserve. The increase in collective reserve was primarily driven by a small number of downgrades and extensions in the C I portfolio and expectations for weaker prices in the CRE portfolio. The decrease in individual reserves was driven by one C I loan that was charged off in the first quarter, partially offset by the default of one C I loan in the current quarter. 
 Wealth Management Noninterest Expense 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Noninterest Expense, which includes the direct expenses of the reporting segment, indirect expense allocations for product and operating support and indirect expense allocations for certain corporate support services, increased 34.4 million, or 8 , from the prior-year quarter and 102.5 million, or 7 , from the prior-year period, primarily reflecting higher indirect expense allocations. 
 
 Other 
 Other Noninterest Income 
 For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, Other Noninterest Income increased 50.1 million from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to the gain related to the sale of an equity investment, partially offset by higher expenses related to existing Visa Class B swap agreements in the current quarter. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Other Noninterest Income increased 747.1 million from the prior-year period primarily due to the gain related to the net impact from the Visa transactions in the second quarter of 2024 and the current-quarter gain related to the sale of an equity investment, partially offset by the loss on sale of available for sale debt securities arising from a repositioning of the portfolio in the first quarter of 2024. 
 Other Noninterest Expense 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Other Noninterest Expense increased 85.5 million from the prior-year period, primarily due to the charitable contribution to the Northern Trust Foundation and a legal settlement in the prior quarter and additional expense related to the FDIC special assessment, partially offset by a decrease in non-allocated occupancy expense primarily arising from early lease exits.

 Average balances are considered to be a better measure of balance sheet trends, as period-end balances can be impacted by the timing of deposit and withdrawal activity involving large client balances. Average earning assets increased from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to higher client deposits. Average earning assets were relatively unchanged compared to the prior-year period. 
 Select Earning Assets. Average securities decreased from the prior-year quarter and the prior-year period reflecting the impact of repositioning and reinvesting in short-term and long-term securities. For additional discussion relating to the securities

 Client Deposits. Average Interest-Bearing Deposits increased in both the the prior-year quarter and prior-year period primarily due to an increase in client balances as a result of strategic pricing actions. Demand and Other Noninterest-Bearing Deposits decreased in both the prior-year quarter and prior-year period as clients migrated into higher yield products. 
 Short-Term Borrowings. Short-term borrowings includes Federal Funds Purchased, Securities Sold under Agreements to Repurchase, and Other Borrowings. The decrease in average Other Borrowings from the prior-year quarter and prior-year period was primarily due to strategic utilization of balance sheet capacity. 
 Stockholders Equity. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Corporation declared cash dividends totaling 151.6 million and 459.3 million to common stockholders, and cash dividends totaling 16.2 million and 37.1 million to preferred stockholders, respectively.

 Securities Portfolio (continued) 

 20.1 million and 2.3 billion of gross unrealized gains and losses, respectively. 245.5 million of the 1.6 billion gross unrealized losses relate to AFS debt securities as of September 30, 2024, and 582.4 million of the 2.3 billion gross unrealized losses relate to AFS debt securities as of December 31, 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the 28.3 billion AFS debt securities portfolio had unrealized losses, excluding securities with an allowance for credit losses, of 114.3 million, 45.6 million, and 19.1 million related to government-sponsored agency securities, sub-sovereign, supranational and non-U.S. agency bonds and U.S. government, respectively, which are primarily attributable to higher average market interest rates as compared to the respective purchase dates of the securities. As of December 31, 2023, the 23.1 billion AFS debt securities portfolio had unrealized losses, excluding securities with an allowance for credit losses, of 200.3 million, 105.8 million, and 100.0 million related to government sponsored agency, supranational and non-U.S. agency bonds, and other asset-backed, respectively, which were primarily attributable to lower yields and tighter spreads. 
 In January 2024, the Corporation sold certain AFS debt securities that were in an unrealized loss position. The 189.4 million loss is recognized in Investment Security Gains (Losses), net on the consolidated statements of income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In November 2023, the Corporation sold certain AFS debt securities that were in an unrealized loss position. The 176.4 million loss is recognized in Investment Security Gains (Losses), net on the consolidated statements of income for the period ended December 31, 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the 22.7 billion HTM debt securities portfolio had unrealized losses of 823.8 million, 197.6 million and 156.9 million related to government-sponsored agency, sub-sovereign, supranational and non-U.S. agency bonds and Other respectively, which are primarily attributable to higher average market interest rates as compared to the respective purchase dates of the securities. As of December 31, 2023, the 26.2 billion HTM debt securities portfolio had an unrealized loss of 1.0 billion and 294.9 million related to government-sponsored agency and sub-sovereign, supranational and non-U.S. agency bonds, respectively, which are primarily attributable to lower yields and tighter spreads. 
 HTM debt securities consist of securities that management intends to, and Northern Trust has the ability to, hold until maturity. For additional information relating to the securities portfolio, refer to Note 4 Securities. 
 Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are accounted for as collateralized financings and recorded at the amounts at which the securities were acquired or sold plus accrued interest. To minimize potential credit risk associated with these transactions, the fair value of the securities purchased or sold is monitored, limits are set on exposure with counterparties, and the financial condition of counterparties is regularly assessed. It is Northern Trust s policy to take possession, either directly or via third-party custodians, of securities purchased under agreements to resell. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are held by the counterparty until their repurchase. 
 For additional information relating to the securities sold under agreements to repurchase, refer to Note 22 Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase. 
 
 Nonaccrual Loans and Other Real Estate Owned 
 Nonaccrual assets consist of nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned (OREO). OREO is comprised of commercial and residential properties acquired in partial or total satisfaction of loans. 
 The following table provides the amounts of nonaccrual loans, by loan segment and class, and of OREO that were outstanding at the dates shown, as well as the balance of loans that were delinquent 90 days or more and still accruing interest. Loans that are delinquent 90 days or more and still accruing interest can fluctuate widely based on the timing of cash collections, renegotiation and renewals.

 Nonaccrual assets of 39.3 million as of September 30, 2024 decreased 25.8 million, or 40 , from December 31, 2023, primarily due to a private client loan payoff and a commercial and institutional loan charge-off, both of which occurred in the first quarter. In addition to the negative impact on Net Interest Income and the risk of credit losses, nonaccrual assets also increase operating costs due to the expense associated with collection efforts. Changes in the level of nonaccrual assets may be indicative of changes in the credit quality of one or more loan classes. Changes in credit quality impact the allowance for credit losses through the resultant adjustment of the allowance evaluated on an individual basis and the quantitative and qualitative factors used in the determination of the allowance evaluated on a collective basis within the allowance for credit losses. 
 Northern Trust s credit policies do not allow for the origination of loan types generally considered to be high risk in nature, such as option adjustable rate mortgage loans, subprime loans, loans with initial teaser rates and loans with excessively high loan-to-value ratios. Residential real estate loans consist of first lien mortgages and equity credit lines, which generally require a loan-to-collateral value of no more than 65 to 80 at inception. Appraisals of supporting collateral for residential real estate loans are obtained at loan origination and upon refinancing or default or when otherwise considered warranted. Residential real estate collateral appraisals are performed and reviewed by independent third parties. 
 The commercial real estate portfolio consists of commercial mortgages and construction, acquisition and development loans extended primarily to experienced investors well known to Northern Trust. Underwriting standards generally reflect conservative loan-to-value ratios and debt service coverage requirements. Recourse to owners through guarantees also is commonly required. For additional information relating to the loans portfolio, refer to Note 5 Loans. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 The allowance for credit losses which represents management s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses related to various portfolios subject to credit risk, off-balance-sheet credit exposure, and specific borrower relationships is determined by management through a disciplined credit review process. Northern Trust measures expected credit losses of financial assets with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis. A financial asset is measured individually if it does not share similar risk characteristics with other financial assets and the related allowance is determined through an individual evaluation. 
 Management s estimates utilized in establishing an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are not dependent on any single assumption. In determining an appropriate allowance level, management evaluates numerous variables, many of which are interrelated or dependent on other assumptions and estimates, and takes into consideration past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The results of the credit reserve estimation methodology are reviewed quarterly by Northern Trust s Credit Loss Reserve Committee, which receives input from Financial Risk Management, Treasury, Corporate Finance, the Economic Research Department, and each of Northern Trust s reporting business units.

STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS 

 The following discusses the statement of cash flow activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 TABLE 29: CASH FLOW ACTIVITY SUMMARY 
 NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, (In Millions) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 2,148.8 (177.6) Investing activities (355.9) 9,647.1 Financing activities 287.7 (8,890.7) Effect of Foreign Currency Exchange Rates on Cash (0.4) (277.3) Change in Cash and Due from Banks 2,080.2 301.5 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities of 2.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily attributable to period earnings and net changes in other operating activities, partially offset by increases in receivables and pension plan contributions. 
 Net cash used in operating activities of 177.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily attributable to higher net collateral deposited with derivative counterparties and an increase in receivables, partially offset by period earnings, net changes in other operating activities, and an increase in interest payable. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities of 355.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily attributable to increased levels of Federal Reserve and other central bank deposits and net purchases of AFS debt securities, partially offset by the net proceeds received from the sale of certain Visa shares and net proceeds associated with loans and HTM debt securities. 
 Net cash provided by investing activities of 9.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily attributable to decreased levels of Federal Reserve and other central bank deposits. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities of 287.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily attributable to the increased levels of total deposits, partially offset by increased treasury share purchases and securities sold under agreements to repurchase. 
 Net cash used in financing activities of 8.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily attributable to the decreased levels of total deposits, partially offset by increased levels of federal funds purchased and proceeds from long-term debt. The decrease in total deposits was primarily attributable to lower levels of savings, money market, and other interest-bearing deposits and lower levels of non-U.S. office interest-bearing deposits.

CAPITAL RATIOS 

 The capital ratios of Northern Trust Corporation and its principal subsidiary, The Northern Trust Company, remained strong at September 30, 2024, exceeding the requirements for classification as well-capitalized under applicable U.S. regulatory requirements. 
 Northern Trust is a Category II institution as defined by the Federal Reserve Board which requires us to adhere to regulatory capital standards. In adhering to these standards, Northern Trust engages in a range of reporting and activities with regulators to affirm our financial strength and stability, including but not limited to, capital adequacy reporting that deducts any unrealized losses related to AFS securities from reported capital, and stringent, annual company-run and supervisory stress testing in the form of Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) exercises, which confirms our ability to remain solvent under severely adverse market conditions. 
 The results of the 2024 Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test (DFAST), published by the Federal Reserve Board on June 26, 2024, resulted in Northern Trust s stress capital buffer and effective Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio minimum requirement remaining constant at 2.5 and 7.0 , respectively, for the annual capital plan cycle beginning on October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025. 
 On July 27, 2023, the U.S. banking regulators issued the Basel III Endgame Proposal, which would change how risk-based capital requirements are determined for banking organizations including Northern Trust. The proposal would eliminate the existing advanced approach methodologies for determining risk-weighted assets (RWA) and replace it with a new expanded risk-based approach. The new requirements would be phased in over a three-year period beginning July 1, 2025. Based on our current understanding of the proposed rule, we estimate that, if the expanded risk-based approach had applied on a fully phased-in basis, and in the absence of taking any actions to mitigate its impact, our expanded risk-based approach RWAs would have been approximately 5 to 15 higher than our actual standardized approach RWAs. 
 The table below provides capital ratios, as well as the required minimum capital ratios, for Northern Trust Corporation and The Northern Trust Company.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS AND DEVELOPMENTS 

 In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (ASU 2023-07). ASU 2023-07 significantly expands disclosures about a public entity s reportable segments, primarily through more frequent and enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 does not change how a public entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates those operating segments or applies the quantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments. ASU 2023-07 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption, the impact of ASU 2023-07 will be limited to certain enhancements within the notes to the consolidated financial statements and therefore is not expected to have an impact on Northern Trust s consolidated balance sheets or consolidated statements of income. 
 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (ASU 2023-09). ASU 2023-09 enhances disclosures by further disaggregating existing annual income tax disclosures related to the effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, although early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption, the impact of ASU 2023-09 will be limited to certain enhancements within the notes to the consolidated financial statements and therefore is not expected to have an impact on Northern Trust s consolidated balance sheets or consolidated statements of income. 

RISK MANAGEMENT 
 Liquidity Risk 
 Liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to raise sufficient funds or maintain collateral to meet balance sheet and contingent liability cash flow obligations when due, because of firm-specific or market-wide stress events. Northern Trust is a Category II institution as defined by the Federal Reserve Board which requires us to adhere to the same regulatory liquidity standards as U.S. global systemically important bank holding companies (GSIBs). In adhering to these standards, Northern Trust engages in a range of reporting and activities with regulators to affirm our financial strength and stability, including but not limited to, daily Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding Ratio calculations to regulators. 
 We maintain a highly liquid balance sheet consisting principally of cash held at the Federal Reserve and other central banks, money market assets, and short-term investment securities, which were 64 and 59 of total assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 87 and 82 of Northern Trust s securities portfolio is composed of U.S. Treasury, government sponsored agency and triple-A rated securities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Market Risk 
 There are two types of market risk, interest rate risk associated with the banking book and trading risk. Interest rate risk associated with the banking book is the potential for movements in interest rates to cause changes in Net Interest Income and the market value of equity, including Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) from the AFS debt securities portfolio. Trading risk is the potential for movements in market variables such as foreign exchange and interest rates to cause changes in the value of trading positions. 
 Northern Trust uses two primary measurement techniques to manage interest rate risk: Net Interest Income (NII) sensitivity and Market Value of Equity (MVE) sensitivity. NII sensitivity provides management with a short-term view of the impact of interest rate changes on NII. MVE sensitivity provides management with a long-term view of interest rate changes on MVE based on the period-end balance sheet. Higher interest rates may impact the fair value of AFS debt securities which in turn affects Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), which can impact regulatory capital ratios. 
 As part of its risk management activities, Northern Trust also measures daily the risk of loss associated with all trading book positions using a Value-at-Risk (VaR) model and applying the historical simulation methodology. The following information about Northern Trust s management of market risk should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 NII Sensitivity The modeling of NII sensitivity incorporates on-balance-sheet positions, as well as derivative financial instruments (principally interest rate swaps) that are used to manage interest rate risk. Northern Trust uses market implied forward interest rates as the base case and measures the sensitivity (i.e., change) of a static balance sheet to changes in interest rates. Stress testing of interest rates is performed to include such scenarios as immediate parallel shocks to rates, nonparallel (i.e., twist) changes to yield curves that result in their becoming steeper or flatter, and changes to the relationship among the yield curves (i.e., basis risk). 
 The NII sensitivity analysis incorporates certain critical assumptions such as interest rates and client behaviors under changing rate environments. These assumptions are based on a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior. The simulation cannot precisely estimate NII sensitivity given uncertainty in the assumptions. The following key assumptions are incorporated into the simulation: 
 
 28 

RISK MANAGEMENT (continued) 
 Market Risk (continued) 

the balance sheet size and mix remains constant over the simulation horizon with maturing assets and liabilities replaced with instruments with similar terms as those that are maturing, with the exception of certain nonmaturity deposits that are considered short-term in nature and therefore receive a more conservative interest-bearing treatment; 
 prepayments on mortgage loans and securities collateralized by mortgages are projected under each rate scenario using a third-party mortgage analytics system that incorporates market prepayment assumptions; 
 cash flows for structured securities are estimated using a third-party vendor in conjunction with the prepayments provided by the third-party mortgage analytics vendor; 
 nonmaturity deposit pricing is projected based on Northern Trust s actual historical patterns and management judgment, depending upon the availability of historical data and current pricing strategies/or judgment; and 
 new business rates are based on current spreads to market indices. 
 The following table shows the estimated NII impact over the next twelve months of 100 and 200 basis point ramps upward and downward in interest rates relative to forward rates as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. Each rate movement is assumed to occur gradually over a one-year period. 
 TABLE 31: NET INTEREST INCOME SENSITIVITY

 The NII sensitivity analysis does not incorporate certain management actions that may be used to mitigate adverse effects of actual interest rate movement. For that reason and others, the estimated impacts do not reflect the likely actual results but serve as estimates of interest rate risk. NII sensitivity is not comparable to actual results disclosed elsewhere or directly predictive of future values of other measures provided. 
 MVE Sensitivity MVE is defined as the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities, net of the value of financial derivatives that are used to manage the interest rate risk of balance sheet items. The MVE looks at the whole balance sheet, which includes AFS debt securities, HTM debt securities, money market accounts, deposits, loans and wholesale borrowings. The potential effect of interest rate changes on MVE is derived from the impact of such changes on projected future cash flows and the present value of these cash flows and is then compared to the established limit. Northern Trust uses current market rates (and the future rates implied by these market rates) as the base case and measures MVE sensitivity under various rate scenarios. Stress testing of interest rates is performed to include such scenarios as immediate parallel shocks to rates, nonparallel (i.e., twist) changes to yield curves that result in their becoming steeper or flatter, and changes to the relationship among the yield curves (i.e., basis risk). 
 The MVE sensitivity analysis incorporates certain critical assumptions such as interest rates and client behaviors under changing rate environments. These assumptions are based on a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior. The simulation cannot precisely estimate MVE sensitivity given uncertainty in the assumptions. Many of the assumptions that apply to NII sensitivity also apply to MVE sensitivity simulations, with the following separate key assumptions incorporated into the MVE simulation: 
 
 the present value of nonmaturity deposits is estimated using dynamic decay methodologies or estimated remaining lives, which are based on a combination of Northern Trust s actual historical runoff patterns and management judgment some balances are assumed to be core and have longer lives while other balances are assumed to be temporary and have comparatively shorter lives; 
 the present values of most noninterest-bearing balances (such as receivables, equipment, and payables) are the same as their book values; and 
 Monte Carlo simulation is used to generate forward interest rate paths.

 Market Risk (continued) 

The following table shows the estimated impact on MVE of 100 and 200 basis point shocks up and down from current market implied forward rates at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Each rate movement is assumed to occur gradually over a one-year period.

 The MVE simulations do not incorporate certain management actions that may be used to mitigate adverse effects of actual interest rate movements. For that reason and others, the estimated impacts do not reflect the likely actual results but serve as estimates of interest rate risk. MVE sensitivity is not comparable to actual results disclosed elsewhere or directly predictive of future values of other measures provided. 
 Value-At-Risk (VaR) Northern Trust measures daily the risk of loss associated with trading positions using a VaR model and applying the historical simulation methodology. This statistical model provides estimates, based on high confidence levels, of the potential loss in value that might be incurred if an adverse shift in foreign exchange rates and interest rates were to occur over a small number of days. The model incorporates foreign currency and interest rate volatilities and correlations in price movements among the currencies and interest rates. VaR is computed for each trading desk and for the global portfolio. 
 Northern Trust monitors several variations of the VaR measures to meet specific regulatory and internal management needs. Variations include different methodologies (historical simulation, Monte Carlo simulation and Taylor approximation), horizons of one day and ten days, confidence levels of 95 and 99 , subcomponent VaRs using only foreign exchange (FX) drivers, only interest rate (IR) drivers, and only volatility drivers, and look-back periods of one year, two years, and four years. Those alternative measures provide management an array of corroborating metrics and alternative perspectives on Northern Trust s market risks. 
 The following table presents the levels of total regulatory VaR and its subcomponents, covering global foreign exchange (GFX), foreign currency balances, and interest rate derivatives combined, in the periods indicated below, based on the historical simulation methodology, a 99 confidence level, a one-day horizon and equally weighted volatility. The total VaR is typically less than the sum of its three subcomponents due to diversification benefits derived from interactions among the three drivers.

 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, Northern Trust did not incur an actual GFX trading loss in excess of the daily GFX VaR estimate. 
 Foreign currency balances arise not from executing trades but rather in the course of regular business operations, namely from non-U.S.-dollar-denominated revenues and expenses accruing onto the Corporation s balance sheet. No longer hedged as of the third quarter of 2023, the balances are considered trading positions for regulatory purposes.

RECONCILIATION TO FULLY TAXABLE EQUIVALENT 

 The following table presents a reconciliation of Interest Income, Net Interest Income, net interest margin, and total revenue prepared in accordance with GAAP to such measures on an FTE basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Net interest margin is calculated by dividing annualized Net Interest Income by average interest-earning assets. Management believes this presentation provides a clearer indication of these financial measures for comparative purposes. When adjusted to an FTE basis, yields on taxable, nontaxable and partially taxable assets are comparable; however, the adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on Net Income.

 Level 2 debt securities with an aggregate market value of billion. Substantially all were valued by external pricing vendors. As of December 31, 2023, Northern Trust s AFS debt securities portfolio included Level 2 debt securities with an aggregate market value of billion. All debt securities were valued by external pricing vendors. 
 Level 2 assets and liabilities also include derivative contracts which are valued internally using widely accepted income-based models that incorporate inputs readily observable in actively quoted markets and reflect the contractual terms of the contracts. Observable inputs include foreign exchange rates and interest rates for foreign exchange contracts; interest rates for interest rate swap contracts and forward contracts; and interest rates and volatility inputs for interest rate option contracts. Northern Trust evaluates the impact of counterparty credit risk and its own credit risk on the valuation of its derivative instruments. Factors considered include the likelihood of default by Northern Trust and its counterparties, the remaining maturities of the instruments, net exposures after giving effect to master netting arrangements or similar agreements, available collateral, and other credit enhancements in determining the appropriate fair value of derivative instruments. The resulting valuation adjustments have not been considered material. 
 Visa Class C common shares are also categorized as Level 2 assets and are valued using quoted active market prices for similar securities (Visa Class A common stock). See Visa Class B Common Shares and Makewhole Agreement under Note 20 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities for further information. 
 Level 3 Valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable in the marketplace. 
 Northern Trust s Level 3 liabilities consist of swaps that Northern Trust entered into with the purchaser of million and million shares of Visa Class B common shares previously held by Northern Trust and sold in June 2016 and 2015, respectively. Pursuant to the swaps, Northern Trust retains the risks associated with the ultimate conversion of the Visa Class B common shares into shares of Visa Class A common stock (Visa Class A common shares), such that the counterparty will be compensated for any dilutive adjustments to the conversion ratio and Northern Trust will be compensated for any anti-dilutive adjustments to the ratio. The swaps also require periodic payments from Northern Trust to the counterparty calculated by reference to the market price of Visa Class A common shares and a fixed rate of interest. The fair value of the swaps is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology.

See Visa Class B Common Shares and Makewhole Agreement under Note 20 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities for further information. 
 Northern Trust believes its valuation methods for its assets and liabilities carried at fair value are appropriate; however, the use of different methodologies or assumptions, particularly as applied to Level 3 assets and liabilities, could have a material effect on the computation of their estimated fair values.

 billion and billion of private equity capital call finance loans at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Residential real estate loans consist of traditional first lien mortgages and equity credit lines that generally require a loan-to-collateral value of no more than to at inception. Northern Trust s equity credit line products generally have draw periods of up to years and a balloon payment of any outstanding balance is due at maturity. Payments are interest-only with variable interest rates. In general, Northern Trust does not offer equity credit lines that include an option to convert the outstanding balance to an amortizing payment loan. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, equity credit lines totaled million and million, respectively, and equity credit lines for which first liens were held by Northern Trust represented and of the total equity credit lines, respectively. 
 Included within the commercial-other, commercial-non-U.S., and personal-other classes are short-duration advances primarily related to the processing of custodied client investments, totaling billion and billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Demand deposit overdrafts reclassified as loan balances, primarily in personal-other, totaled million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Loans classified as held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. There were loans classified as held for sale at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. There were no loans sold for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. 
 Credit Quality Indicators. Credit quality indicators are statistics, measurements or other metrics that provide information regarding the relative credit risk of loans. Northern Trust uses a variety of credit quality indicators to assess the credit risk of loans at the segment, class, and individual credit exposure levels. 
 As part of its credit process, Northern Trust utilizes an internal borrower risk rating system to support identification, approval, and monitoring of credit risk. Borrower risk ratings are used in credit underwriting and management reporting. Risk ratings are used for ranking the credit risk of borrowers and their probability of default. Each borrower is rated using one of a number of ratings models, which consider both quantitative and qualitative factors. The ratings models vary among classes of loans in order to capture the unique risk characteristics inherent within each particular type of credit exposure. Provided below are the more significant performance indicator attributes considered within Northern Trust s borrower rating models, by loan class. 
 Commercial and Institutional: leverage, profit margin, liquidity, asset size and capital levels; 
 Commercial Real Estate: debt service coverage, loan-to-value ratio, leasing status and guarantor support; 
 Commercial-Other: leverage, profit margin, liquidity, asset size and capital levels; 
 Non-U.S.: leverage, profit margin, liquidity, return on assets and capital levels; 
 Residential Real Estate: payment history, credit bureau scores and loan-to-value ratio; 
 Private Client: cash-flow-to-debt and net worth ratios, leverage and liquidity; and 
 Personal-Other: cash-flow-to-debt and net worth ratios. 
 While the criteria vary by model, the objective is for the borrower ratings to be consistent in both the measurement and ranking of risk. Each model is calibrated to a master rating scale to support this consistency. Ratings for borrowers not in default range from 1 for the strongest credits to 7 for the weakest non-defaulted credits. Ratings of 8 or 9 are used for defaulted

As of the three months ended September 30, 2024, Northern Trust had charge offs related to modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that had been modified in the last 12 months. As of the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Northern Trust had million charged off related to modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that had been modified in the last 12 months. As of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, Northern Trust had charge offs of less than 1 million related to modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that had been modified in the last 12 months. 
 There were no undrawn loan commitments or standby letters of credit issued to financially distressed borrowers for which Northern Trust has modified the payment terms of the loans as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 The expected credit loss for nonaccrual loans including loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is measured based on either the expected future cash flows, the value of collateral, or other factors that may impact the borrower s ability to pay. If the discounted cash flow method is utilized, the credit loss is measured based upon the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate based on the post-modification contractual rate. If a loan s contractual interest rate varies based on subsequent changes in an independent factor, such as an index or rate, the loan s effective interest rate is calculated based on the factor as it changes over the life of the loan. Northern Trust elected not to project changes in the factor for purposes of estimating expected future cash flows. Further, Northern Trust elected not to adjust the effective interest rate for prepayments. If the loan is collateral dependent, the expected loss is measured based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date. If the loan valuation is less than the recorded value of the loan, either an allowance is established or a charge-off is recorded for the difference. The nature and extent of further deterioration in credit quality, including a subsequent default, is considered in the determination of an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses for all loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty.

 Excluding the impact of the negative provision for AFS debt securities, there was a Provision for Credit Losses of million in the current quarter, as compared to a provision of million in the prior-year quarter. The provision resulted from an increase in both the collective and individual reserves. The increase in collective reserves was primarily driven by a small number of downgrades and extensions in the Commercial and Institutional (C I) portfolio. The reserve evaluated on a collective basis relates to pooled financial assets sharing similar risk characteristics. The increase in individual reserves was driven by the default of one C I loan. There were net recoveries of million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, while there were million net recoveries for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a million provision in the prior-year period. The provision was primarily due to an increase in collective reserves, partially offset by a decrease in individual reserves. The increase in collective reserves was primarily driven by a small number of downgrades and extensions in the C I portfolio and by expectations for weaker prices in the CRE portfolio. The decrease in individual reserves was driven by one C I loan charge-off in the first quarter, partially offset by the default of one C I loan in the current quarter. There were net charge-offs of million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net charge-offs of million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For further detail, please see the Allowance for the Loan Portfolio and the Allowance for Held to Maturity Debt Securities Portfolio sections below. 
 The portion of the allowance assigned to loans, HTM debt securities, and other financial assets is presented as a contra asset in Allowance for Credit Losses on the consolidated balance sheets. The portion of the allowance assigned to undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit is reported in Other Liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. For credit exposure and the associated allowance related to fee receivables, please refer to Note 13 Revenue from Contracts with Clients. For information related to the allowance for AFS debt securities, please refer to Note 4 Securities. For all other financial assets recognized at amortized cost, which includes Cash and Due from Banks, Other Central Bank Deposits, Interest Bearing Deposits with Banks, and Other Assets, please refer to the Allowance for Other Financial Assets section within this footnote. 
 Forecasting and Reversion. Estimating expected lifetime credit losses requires the consideration of the effect of future economic conditions. Northern Trust employs multiple scenarios over a reasonable and supportable period (currently to project future conditions. Key variables determined to be relevant for projecting credit losses on the portfolios in scope include macroeconomic factors, such as corporate profits, unemployment, disposable income, and real estate price indices, as well as financial market factors such as market volatility and credit spreads. For periods beyond the reasonable and supportable period, Northern Trust reverts to its own historical loss experiences on a straight-line basis over four quarters. The primary forecast in the current quarter reflects an outlook of steady growth, despite modest deterioration within the Commercial Real Estate industry, with inflation and labor markets stabilizing and interest rates falling. Recognizing the uncertainty in the primary forecast, an alternative scenario is also considered, which reflects a recession that incorporates the experiences of a wider set of historical economic cycles. 
 Contractual Term. Northern Trust estimates expected credit losses over the contractual term of the financial assets adjusted for prepayments, unless prepayments are not relevant to specific portfolios or sub-portfolios. Extension and renewal options are typically not considered since it is not Northern Trust s practice to enter into arrangements where the borrower has the unconditional option to renew, or a conditional extension option whereby the conditions are beyond Northern Trust s control.

 Allowance Related to Credit Exposure Evaluated on a Collective Basis. Expected credit losses are measured on a collective basis as long as the financial assets included in the respective pool share similar risk characteristics. If financial assets are deemed to not share similar risk characteristics, an individual assessment is warranted. 
 The allowance estimation methodology for the collective assessment is based on data representative of the Corporation s financial asset portfolio from a historical observation period that includes both expansionary and recessionary periods. The estimation methodology and the related qualitative adjustment framework segregate the loan portfolio into homogeneous segments based on similar risk characteristics or risk monitoring methods.

 Northern Trust analyzes its exposure to credit losses from both on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet activity using a consistent methodology for the quantitative framework as well as the qualitative framework. For purposes of estimating the allowance for credit losses for undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit, the exposure at default includes an estimated drawdown of unused credit based on credit utilization factors, resulting in a proportionate amount of expected credit losses.

 HTM debt securities classified as U.S. government, government sponsored agency, and certain securities classified as obligations of states and political subdivisions are considered to be guarantees of the U.S. government or an agency of the U.S. government and, therefore, an allowance for credit losses is not estimated for such investments as the expected probability of non-payment of the amortized cost basis is zero. 
 HTM debt securities classified as other asset-backed securities represent pools of underlying receivables from which the cash flows are used to pay the bonds that vary in seniority. Utilizing a qualitative estimation approach, the allowance for other asset-backed securities is assessed by evaluating underlying pool performance based on delinquency rates and available credit support. 
 HTM debt securities classified as other relate to investments purchased by Northern Trust to fulfill its obligations under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). Northern Trust fulfills its obligations under the CRA by making qualified investments for purposes of supporting institutions and programs that benefit low-to-moderate income communities within Northern Trust s market area. The allowance for CRA investments is assessed using a qualitative estimation approach primarily based on internal historical performance experience and default history of the underlying CRA portfolios to determine a quantitative component of the allowance. 
 The allowance estimation methodology for all other HTM debt securities is developed using a combination of external and internal data. The estimation methodology groups securities with shared characteristics for which the probability of default and the loss given default are applied to the total exposure at default to determine a quantitative component of the allowance. 
 Allowance for Other Financial Assets. The allowance for Other Financial Assets consists of the allowance for Due from Banks, Other Central Bank Deposits, Interest Bearing Deposits with Banks, and Other Assets. The Other Assets category includes other miscellaneous credit exposures reported in Other Assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The allowance estimation methodology for Other Financial Assets primarily utilizes a similar approach as the one used for the HTM debt securities portfolio. It consists of a combination of externally and internally developed loss data, adjusted for the appropriate contractual term. Northern Trust s portfolio of Other Financial Assets is composed mostly of institutions within the 1 to 2 internal borrower rating category and is expected to exhibit minimal to modest likelihood of loss. The Allowance for Credit Losses related to Other Financial Assets was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Accrued Interest. Accrued interest balances are reported within Other Assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Northern Trust elected not to measure an allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivables related to its loan and securities portfolio as its policy is to write-off uncollectible accrued interest receivable balances in a timely manner. Accrued interest is written off by reversing interest income during the period the financial asset is moved from an accrual to a nonaccrual status.

 client-focused reporting segments: Asset Servicing and Wealth Management. Asset management and related services are provided to Asset Servicing and Wealth Management clients primarily by the Asset Management business. The revenue and expenses of Asset Management and certain other support functions are allocated fully to Asset Servicing and Wealth Management. 
 Reporting segment financial information, presented on an internal management-reporting basis, is determined by accounting systems used to allocate revenue and expense to each segment, and incorporates processes for allocating assets, liabilities, equity and the applicable interest income and expense utilizing a funds transfer pricing (FTP) methodology. Under the methodology, assets and liabilities receive a funding charge or credit that considers interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and other product characteristics on an instrument level. Additionally, segment information is presented on an FTE basis as management believes an FTE presentation provides a clearer indication of net interest income. The adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on Net Income.

 Upon adoption of ASU 2023-02 on January 1, 2024, Northern Trust elected to account for qualifying new markets tax credit investments under the proportional amortization method. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2023-02, Northern Trust accounted for qualifying affordable housing investments under the proportional amortization method and continues to do so subsequent to the adoption of ASU 2023-02. Under the proportional amortization method, the carrying amount of the investment is amortized in proportion to the income tax credits and other income tax benefits received in the current period as compared to the total income tax credits and income tax benefits expected to be received over the life of the investment. Income tax credits and other income tax benefits and amortization expense associated with unconsolidated tax credit structures are primarily reported in the Provision for Income Tax on the consolidated statement of income. 
 Northern Trust adopted ASU 2023-02 on a modified retrospective basis. As a result, amortization expense related to new markets tax credit investments is reported in the Provision for Income Tax beginning January 1, 2024. Prior to January 1, 2024, amortization expense related to new markets tax credit investments was previously reported in Other Operating Expense.

 Investment funds. Northern Trust acts as asset manager for various funds in which clients of Northern Trust are investors. As an asset manager of funds, Northern Trust earns a competitively priced fee that is based on assets managed and varies with each fund s investment objective. Based on its analysis, Northern Trust has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs under GAAP. 
 Some of the funds for which Northern Trust acts as asset manager comply or operate in accordance with requirements that are similar to those in Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for registered money market funds and, therefore, the funds are exempt from the consolidation requirements in ASC 810-10. Northern Trust does t have any contractual obligations to provide financial support to the funds.

 billion and billion guarantee to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) under the sponsored member program, without taking into consideration the related collateral, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Undrawn Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. Since a significant portion of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future loans or liquidity requirements. 
 Standby Letters of Credit obligate Northern Trust to meet certain financial obligations of its clients, if, under the contractual terms of the agreement, the clients are unable to do so. These instruments are primarily issued to support public and private financial commitments, including commercial paper, bond financing, initial margin requirements on futures exchanges and similar transactions. Northern Trust is obligated to meet the entire financial obligation of these agreements and in certain cases is able to recover the amounts paid through recourse against collateral received or other participants. Since the vast majority of the standby letters of credit are never drawn, the total standby letters of credit amount does not necessarily represent future loans or liquidity requirements. 
 Financial Guarantees are issued by Northern Trust to guarantee the performance of a client to a third party under certain arrangements. 
 Commercial Letters of Credit are instruments issued by Northern Trust on behalf of its clients that authorize a third party (the beneficiary) to draw drafts up to a stipulated amount under the specified terms and conditions of the agreement and other similar instruments. Commercial letters of credit are issued primarily to facilitate international trade. 
 Securities Lent with Indemnification involves Northern Trust lending securities owned by clients to borrowers who are reviewed and approved by the Northern Trust Capital Markets Credit Committee, as part of its securities custody activities and at the direction of its clients. In connection with these activities, Northern Trust has issued indemnifications to certain clients against certain losses that are a direct result of a borrower s failure to return securities when due, should the value of such securities exceed the value of the collateral required to be posted. Borrowers are required to collateralize fully securities received with cash or marketable securities. As securities are loaned, collateral is maintained at a minimum of of the fair value of the securities plus accrued interest. The collateral is revalued on a daily basis. The amount of securities loaned as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 subject to indemnification was billion and billion, respectively. Because of the credit quality of the borrowers and the requirement to fully collateralize securities borrowed, management believes that the exposure to credit loss from this activity is not significant and liability was recorded as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023, related to these indemnifications. 
 Unsettled Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Agreements. Northern Trust enters into repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements which may settle at a future date. In repurchase agreements, Northern Trust receives cash from and provides securities as collateral to a counterparty. In reverse repurchase agreements, Northern Trust advances cash to and receives securities as collateral from a counterparty. These transactions are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets on the

 Sponsored Member Program . Northern Trust is an approved Government Securities Division (GSD) netting and sponsoring member in the FICC sponsored member program, through which Northern Trust submits eligible repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions in U.S. government securities between Northern Trust and its sponsored member clients for novation and clearing. Northern Trust may sponsor clients to clear their eligible repurchase transactions with the FICC. As a sponsoring member, Northern Trust guarantees to the FICC the prompt and full payment and performance of its sponsored member clients respective obligations under the FICC GSD s rules. To mitigate Northern Trust s credit exposure under this guarantee, Northern Trust obtains a security interest in its sponsored member clients collateral. See Note 23 Offsetting of Assets and Liabilities for additional information on Northern Trust s repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements. 
 Clearing and Settlement Organizations . The Bank is a participating member of various cash, securities and foreign exchange clearing and settlement organizations. It participates in these organizations on behalf of its clients and on its own behalf as a result of its own activities. A wide variety of cash and securities transactions are settled through these organizations, including those involving U.S. Treasuries, obligations of states and political subdivisions, asset-backed securities, commercial paper, dollar placements, and securities issued by the Government National Mortgage Association. 
 Certain of these industry clearing and settlement exchanges require their members to guarantee their obligations and liabilities and/or to provide liquidity support in the event other members do not honor their obligations as stipulated in each clearing organization s membership agreement. Exposure related to these agreements varies, primarily as a result of fluctuations in the volume of transactions cleared through the organizations. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Northern Trust has not recorded any material liabilities under these arrangements as Northern Trust believes the likelihood that a clearing or settlement exchange (of which Northern Trust is a member) would become insolvent is remote. Controls related to these clearing transactions are closely monitored by management to protect the assets of Northern Trust and its clients. 
 FDIC Special Assessment . In November 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issued a final rule to implement a special assessment to recoup losses to the deposit insurance fund associated with bank failures in the first half of 2023. In conjunction with the special assessment, million was recognized as an accrued liability and related expense in the fourth quarter of 2023. During the first half of 2024, the FDIC published revised estimated losses as well as estimated recoveries from the related bank failures. As a result, Northern Trust recognized an additional accrued liability and related expense of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, recorded to Other Operating Expense. As of September 30, 2024 , Northern Trust estimates its total liability related to the special assessment to be million. 
 Legal Proceedings. In the normal course of business, the Corporation and its subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to pending and threatened legal actions, and are subject to regulatory examinations, information-gathering requests, investigations, and proceedings, both formal and informal. In certain legal actions, claims for substantial monetary damages are asserted. In regulatory matters, claims for disgorgement, restitution, penalties and/or other remedial actions or sanctions may be sought. 
 Based on current knowledge, after consultation with legal counsel and after taking into account current accruals, management does not believe that losses, fines or penalties, if any, arising from pending litigation or threatened legal actions or regulatory matters either individually or in the aggregate, after giving effect to applicable reserves and insurance coverage will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the Corporation, although such matters could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation s operating results for a particular period. 
 Under GAAP, (i) an event is probable if the future event or events are likely to occur (ii) an event is reasonably possible if the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely and (iii) an event is remote if the chance of the future event or events occurring is slight. 
 The outcome of litigation and regulatory matters is inherently difficult to predict and/or the range of loss often cannot be reasonably estimated, particularly for matters that (i) will be decided by a jury, (ii) are in early stages, (iii) involve uncertainty as to the likelihood of a class being certified or the ultimate size of the class, (iv) are subject to appeals or motions, (v) involve significant factual issues to be resolved, including with respect to the amount of damages, (vi) do not specify the amount of damages sought or (vii) seek very large damages based on novel and complex damage and liability legal theories. Accordingly, the Corporation cannot reasonably estimate the eventual outcome of these pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or what the eventual loss, fines or penalties, if any, related to each pending matter will be. 
 In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Corporation records accruals for litigation and regulatory matters when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. When loss contingencies are not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Corporation does not record accruals. material accruals have been recorded for pending litigation or threatened legal actions or regulatory matters.

 to approximately million in the aggregate. The Corporation s estimate with respect to the aggregate range of reasonably possible loss is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions and known and unknown uncertainties. The matters underlying the estimated range will change from time to time, and actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate. 
 In certain other pending matters, there may be a range of reasonably possible loss (including reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts accrued) that cannot be reasonably estimated for the reasons described above. Such matters are not included in the estimated range of reasonably possible loss discussed above. 
 In 2015, Northern Trust Fiduciary Services (Guernsey) Limited (NTFS), an indirect subsidiary of the Corporation, was charged by a French investigating magistrate judge with complicity in estate tax fraud in connection with the administration of trusts for which it serves as trustee. Charges also were brought against a number of other persons and entities related to this matter. In 2017, a French court found no estate tax fraud had occurred and NTFS and all other persons and entities charged were acquitted. The Public Prosecutor s Office of France appealed the court decision and in June 2018 a French appellate court issued its opinion on the matter, acquitting all persons and entities charged, including NTFS. In January 2021, the Cour de Cassation, the highest court in France, reversed the June 2018 appellate court ruling, requiring a re-trial at the appellate court level. This re-trial concluded in October 2023. On March 5, 2024 the appellate court rendered a judgment against all defendants, including NTFS. NTFS was ordered to pay a fine of in conjunction with the judgment. In addition, the court ordered that certain of those convicted in relation to tax fraud or aiding and abetting tax fraud, including NTFS, are jointly and severally liable for any allegedly unpaid estate taxes owing, plus penalties and interest. NTFS provided no tax advice and was not involved in the preparation or filing of the challenged estate tax filings in this case. Further, NTFS believes it acted in accordance with all applicable laws and fully complied with its fiduciary duties. Accordingly, NTFS filed an appeal of the judgment on March 5, 2024. Under applicable law, upon the filing by NTFS of its appeal, the judgment, as well as its effects (including the fine and joint and several liability) will be stayed pending the outcome of the appeal. 
 Visa Class B Common Shares and Makewhole Agreement. Northern Trust, as a member of Visa U.S.A. Inc. (Visa U.S.A.) and in connection with the 2007 restructuring of Visa U.S.A. and its affiliates and the 2008 initial public offering of Visa Inc. (Visa), received certain Visa Class B common shares. The Visa Class B common shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions until the final resolution of certain litigation related to interchange fees involving Visa (the covered litigation), at which time the shares are convertible into Visa Class A common shares based on a conversion rate dependent upon the ultimate cost of resolving the covered litigation. Since 2018, Visa has deposited an additional billion into an escrow account previously established with respect to the covered litigation. As a result of the additional contributions to the escrow account, the rate at which Visa Class B common shares will convert into Visa Class A common shares was reduced to as of September 30, 2024. 
 In September 2018, Visa reached a proposed class settlement agreement covering damage claims but not injunctive relief claims regarding the covered litigation. In December 2019, the district court granted final approval for the proposed class settlement agreement. In March 2023, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court s approval of the class settlement agreement. Certain merchants have opted out of the class settlement and are pursuing claims separately. The ultimate resolution of the covered litigation, the timing for removal of the selling restrictions on the Visa Class B common shares and the rate at which such shares will ultimately convert into Visa Class A common shares are uncertain. 
 In May 2024, Northern Trust received million Visa Class B-2 common shares and thousand Visa Class C common shares via its full participation in an offer to exchange outstanding shares of Visa s Class B common stock (Exchange Offer). The newly issued series of Visa Class B common shares are subject to the same transfer and convertibility restrictions as the previously outstanding Visa Class B common shares. The Visa Class C common shares will automatically be converted at the then applicable conversion rate into shares of Visa Class A common stock if transferred to a person other than a Visa member or an affiliate of a Visa member. After the initial exchange offer, Visa can, at its discretion, conduct up to successive potential exchange offers, in each case, if more than months have passed since the previous exchange offer and after a further reduction of interchange fees at issue in the unresolved claims for damages in the covered litigation. 
 Northern Trust holds the Visa Class B-2 common shares received in the Exchange Offer at their carryover basis of as of September 30, 2024. Based upon the September 30, 2024, closing price of for a Visa Class A common share, the estimated value of Northern Trust s Visa Class B-2 common shares was approximately million at the current conversion rate of Visa Class B to Visa Class A common shares. The estimated value does not represent fair value given the shares limited transferability. 
 Northern Trust sold thousand Visa Class C common shares as of September 30, 2024 and recorded a realized gain of million on the sales through Other Operating Income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The remaining

 Notional amounts of derivative financial instruments do not represent credit risk and are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheets. They are used merely to express the volume of this activity. Northern Trust s credit-related risk of loss is limited to the positive fair value of the derivative instrument, net of any collateral received, which is significantly less than the notional amount. 
 All derivative financial instruments, whether designated as hedges or not, are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value within Other Assets or Other Liabilities. Northern Trust has elected to net derivative assets and liabilities when legally enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements exist between Northern Trust and the counterparty. 
 Hedging Derivative Instruments Designated under GAAP. Northern Trust uses derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk. Certain hedging relationships are formally designated and qualify for hedge accounting under GAAP as fair value, cash flow or net investment hedges. 
 In order to qualify for hedge accounting, a formal assessment is performed on a calendar-quarter basis to verify that derivatives used in designated hedging transactions continue to be highly effective in offsetting the changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. If a derivative ceases to be highly effective, matures, is sold or is terminated, or if a hedged forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring, hedge accounting is terminated and the derivative is treated as a trading instrument. 
 Fair Value Hedges. Derivatives are designated as fair value hedges to limit Northern Trust s exposure to changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities due to movements in interest rates. Northern Trust may enter into interest rate swaps to hedge changes in fair value of AFS debt securities and long-term subordinated debt and senior notes. Northern Trust applied the shortcut method of accounting, available under GAAP, which assumes there is perfect effectiveness in a hedge, for all of its fair value hedges during the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument and changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk are recognized currently in earnings within the same income statement line item. 
 Cash Flow Hedges. Derivatives are also d esignated as cash flow hedges in order to minimize the variability in cash flows of earning assets or forecasted transactions caused by movements in interest or foreign exchange rates. Northern Trust may enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge changes in cash flows due to movements in foreign exchange rates of forecasted foreign-currency-denominated transactions and foreign-currency-denominated debt securities. Northern Trust may also enter into interest rate contracts to hedge changes in cash flows due to movements in interest rates of AFS debt securities. The change

 material gains or losses reclassified into earnings during the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, as a result of the discontinuance of forecasted transactions that were no longer probable of occurring. It is estimated that net gains of million will be reclassified into Net Income within the next twelve months relating to cash flow hedges of foreign-currency-denominated debt securities. As of September 30, 2024, was the maximum length of time over which the exposure to variability in future cash flows of forecasted foreign-currency-denominated debt securities was being hedged.

 Net Investment Hedges. Certain foreign exchange contracts are designated as net investment hedges to minimize Northern Trust s exposure to variability in the foreign currency translation of net investments in non-U.S. branches and subsidiaries. Net investment hedge losses of million and gains of million were recognized in AOCI related to foreign exchange contracts for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net investment hedge losses of million and gains of million were recognized in AOCI related to foreign exchange contracts for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Derivative Instruments Not Designated as Hedging under GAAP. Northern Trust s derivative instruments that are not designated as hedging under GAAP include derivatives for purposes of client-related and trading activities, as well as other risk management purposes. These activities consist principally of providing foreign exchange services to clients in connection with Northern Trust s global custody business. However, in the normal course of business, Northern Trust also engages in trading of currencies for its own account. 
 Non-designated risk management derivatives may include foreign exchange contracts entered into to manage the foreign currency risk of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated assets and liabilities, the net investment in certain non-U.S. affiliates, commercial loans and forecasted foreign-currency-denominated transactions. Swaps related to sales of certain Visa Class B common shares were entered into pursuant to which Northern Trust retains the risks associated with the ultimate conversion of the Visa Class B common shares into Visa Class A common shares. Total return swaps are entered into to manage the equity price risk associated with certain investments.

 All of Northern Trust s securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements) and securities purchased under agreements to resell (reverse repurchase agreements) involve the transfer of financial assets in exchange for cash subject to a right and obligation to repurchase those assets for an agreed upon amount. In the event of a repurchase failure, the cash or financial assets are available for offset. Certain repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements are subject to a master netting arrangement, which sets forth the rights and obligations for repurchase and offset. Under the master netting arrangement, Northern Trust is entitled to offset receivables from and collateral placed with a single counterparty against obligations owed to that counterparty. In addition, collateral held by Northern Trust can be offset against receivables from that counterparty. Northern Trust has elected to net securities sold under repurchase agreements against those purchased under resale agreements when the GAAP requirements to net are met. 
 Derivative asset and liability positions with a single counterparty can be offset against each other in cases where legally enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements exist. Derivative assets and liabilities can be further offset by cash collateral received from, and deposited with, the transacting counterparty. The basis for this view is that, upon termination of transactions subject to a master netting arrangement or similar agreement, the individual derivative receivables do not represent resources to which general creditors have rights and individual derivative payables do not represent claims that are equivalent to the claims of general creditors. Northern Trust has elected to net derivative assets and liabilities when legally enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements exist between Northern Trust and the counterparty. 
 Credit risk associated with derivative instruments relates to the failure of the counterparty and the failure of Northern Trust to pay based on the contractual terms of the agreement, and is generally limited to the unrealized fair value gains and losses on these instruments, net of any collateral received or deposited. The amount of credit risk will increase or decrease during the

 million and million, respectively, as of September 30, 2024, and million and million, respectively, as of December 31, 2023, was not offset against derivative assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as the amounts exceeded the net derivative positions with those counterparties. 
 Certain master netting arrangements Northern Trust enters into with derivative counterparties contain credit-risk-related contingent features in which the counterparty has the option to declare Northern Trust in default and accelerate cash settlement of net derivative liabilities with the counterparty in the event Northern Trust s credit rating falls below specified levels. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position was billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Cash collateral amounts deposited with derivative counterparties on those dates included million and billion, respectively, posted against these liabilities, resulting in a net maximum amount of termination payments that could have been required at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, of million and million, respectively. Accelerated settlement of these liabilities would not have a material effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of Northern Trust. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Corporation s management, with the participation of the Corporation s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Corporation in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC s rules and forms. Based on such evaluation, such officers have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
 There have been no changes in the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting.
