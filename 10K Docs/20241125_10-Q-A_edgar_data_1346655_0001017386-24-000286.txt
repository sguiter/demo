of Pebble Beach Enterprises, Inc. (a publicly traded company) and changed the
name to CMG Holdings Group, Inc. the Company ). The purpose of the acquisition was to effect a reverse merger with Pebble
Beach Enterprises, Inc. at a later date. On May 27, 2008, Pebble Beach entered into an Agreement
and Plan of Reorganization with its controlling shareholder, Creative Management Group, Inc., a privately held Delaware corporation. Upon
closing the eighty shareholders of Creative Management Group delivered all their equity interests in Creative Management Group to Pebble
Beach in exchange for shares of common stock in Pebble Beach owned by Creative Management Group, as a result of which Creative Management
Group became a wholly owned subsidiary of Pebble Beach. The shareholders of Creative Management Group received one share of Pebble Beach s
common stock previously owned by Creative Management Group for each issued and outstanding common share owned of Creative Management Group.
As a result, the shares of Pebble Beach that were issued and previously owned by Creative Management Group, are now owned directly
by its shareholders. The 22,135,148 shares of Creative Management Group previously owned by its shareholders are now owned by Pebble Beach,
thereby making Creative Management Group a wholly owned subsidiary of Pebble Beach. Pebble Beach did not issue any new shares as part
of the Reorganization. The transaction was accounted for as a reverse merger and recapitalization whereby Creative Management Group is
the accounting acquirer. Pebble Beach was renamed CMG Holdings Group, Inc. 

On April 1, 2009, the Company, through a
newly formed subsidiary CMGO Capital, Inc., a Nevada corporation, completed the acquisition of XA, The Experiential Agency, Inc. On March
31, 2010, the Company and AudioEye, Inc. AudioEye completed a Stock Purchase Agreement under which the Company acquired
all the capital stock of AudioEye. On June 22, 2011 the Company entered into a Master Agreement subject to shareholder approval and closing
conditions with AudioEye Acquisition Corp., a Nevada corporation where the shareholders of AudioEye Acquisition Corp. exchanged 100 of
the stock in AudioEye Acquisition Corp for of the capital stock of AudioEye. The Company retained 15 of AudioEye subject to transfer
restrictions in accordance with the Master Agreement; in October 2012, the Company distributed to its shareholders, in a dividend, 5 
of the capital stock of AudioEye in accordance with provisions of the Master Agreement. 

The results for the nine and three months
ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the full year. These financial statements and
related footnotes should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows at September 30, 2024 and for the related periods
presented.

CMG HOLDINGS GROUP, INC. 

 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We use estimates of fair
value to value derivative instruments. Fair value is defined as the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between willing and able market participants. In general, our policy in estimating fair values is to first look at observable market prices
for identical assets and liabilities in active markets, where available. When these are not available, other inputs are used to model
fair value such as prices of similar instruments, yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, default rates and credit spreads (including
for our liabilities), relying first on observable data from active markets. Additional adjustments may be made for factors including liquidity,
credit, bid/offer spreads, etc., depending on current market conditions. Transaction costs are not included in the determination of fair
value. When possible, we seek to validate the model s output to market transactions. 

Level 3 

Level 3 applies
to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement
of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. 

The Company's financial instruments
consist principally of cash, accounts payable, and amounts due to related parties. Pursuant to ASC 820, the fair value of our cash is
determined based on "Level I" inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. We believe that
the recorded values of all our other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective
maturity dates or durations.

per annum. The Holder of this Note is entitled, at its option, at any time after cash payment, to convert all or any amount of the
principal face amount of this Note then outstanding into shares of the Company's common stock (the "Common Stock") at a
price for each share of Common Stock at a price ("Conversion Price") of 
per share (the Fixed Price ). Beginning
on the 6th monthly anniversary of the Issuance Date of the Note, the Fixed Price shall be equal to 0.0092 per share . Provided,
however that in the event, the Company s Common Stock trades below 0.007 per share for more than seven (7)
consecutive trading days, the Holder of this Note is entitled, at its option, to convert all or any amount of the principal face
amount of this Note then outstanding into shares of the Company's Common Stock at a Conversion Price equal to the lower of 
the Fixed Price or 75 of the average of the two lowest VWAP s of the Common Stock as
reported on the National Quotations Bureau OTC Marketplace exchange which the Company s shares are traded or any exchange upon

days including the day upon which a Notice of Conversion is received by the Company or its transfer agent (provided such Notice of Conversion
is delivered by fax or other electronic method of communication to the Company or its transfer agent after 4 P.M. Eastern Standard or

days, the Notice of Conversion may be rescinded. Such conversion shall be effectuated by the Company delivering the shares of Common
Stock to the Holder within 3 business days of receipt by the Company of the Notice of Conversion. Accrued but unpaid interest shall be
subject to conversion. No fractional shares or scrip representing fractions of shares will be issued on conversion, but the number
of shares issuable shall be rounded to the nearest whole share . To the extent the Conversion Price of the Company s
Common Stock closes below the par value per share, the Company will take all steps necessary to solicit the consent of the stockholders
to reduce the par value to the lowest value possible under law. The Company agrees to honor all conversions submitted pending this
increase. In no event shall the Holder be allowed to effect a conversion if such conversion, along with all other shares of Company Common
Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates would exceed 4.99 of the outstanding shares of the Common Stock of the Company
(which may be increased up to 9.9 upon 60 days prior written notice by the Investor). The conversion discount, look back period
and other terms will be adjusted on a ratchet basis if the Company offers a more favorable conversion discount, prepayment rate, interest
rate, (whether through a straight discount or in combination with an original issue discount), look back period or other more favorable
term to another party for any financings while this Note is in effect, including but not limited to defaults, penalties and the remedy

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE NINE MONTH PERIOD ENDED

Gross revenues decreased from
 625,568 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 1,179,893 for the nine months ended September, 2024. The decrease in revenues
was mainly attributable to the decrease in overall business due to worldwide inflation. 

Cost of revenue increased from 301,864
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 931,945 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cost of revenues
was mainly attributable to the decrease in overall business due to worldwide inflation. 

Operating
expenses increased from 644,283 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 486,765 
 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in operating expenses is due to the decrease
in support expenses to run business and increase in interest expense for the quarter. 

Net loss decreased from a loss of
 243,326 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to net loss of 163,373 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease
in net income was mainly attributable to decrease in overall business due to worldwide inflation .

cash on hand was 146,624. 

Cash used in operating activities
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 103,817, as compared to cash used in operating activities of 188,289 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net loss to net income was mainly attributable to the Company beginning to come back from the
worldwide pandemic that took place during the previous year. 

Cash used in investing activities
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 9,280 as compared cash used in investing activities of 32,500 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. This was due to the Company not loaning additional funds to NVT during the quarter.

We are a smaller reporting company as defined
by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item. 

ITEM 4 - CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

The Company s Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of March 31, 2022. Based upon such evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2023, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were
not effective due to the identification of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which is identified below,
which we view as an integral part of our disclosure controls and procedures. This conclusion by the Company s Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer does not relate to reporting periods after September 30, 2024. 

Under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024 based on the framework stated by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO 1992). Furthermore, due to our financial situation, the Company will be implementing further
internal controls as the Company becomes operative so as to fully comply with the standards set by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission. 

Our management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
of the Exchange Act. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because
of inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to change in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Based on its evaluation as of September 30, 2024, our
management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of September 30, 2024 due to the identification
of a material weakness. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial
reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial
statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. At any time, if it appears that any control can be implemented to continue
to mitigate such weaknesses, it is immediately implemented. As soon as our finances allow, we
will hire sufficient accounting staff and implement appropriate procedures for monitoring
and review of work performed by our Chief Financial Officer. 

In performing this assessment, management
has identified the following material weaknesses as of September 30, 2024: 

There is a lack of segregation of duties necessary for a good system of internal control due to insufficient accounting staff due to the size of the Company 

Lack of a formal review process that includes multiple levels of reviews 

Employees and management lack the qualifications and training to fulfill their assigned accounting and reporting functions 

Inadequate design of controls over significant accounts and processes 

Inadequate documentation of the components of internal control in general 

Failure in the operating effectiveness over controls related to valuing and recording equity based payments to employees and non-employees 

Failure in the operating effectiveness over controls related to valuing and recording debt instruments including those with conversion options and the related embedded derivative liabilities 

Failure in the operating effectiveness over controls related to recording revenue and expense transactions in the proper period 

Failure in the operating effectiveness over controls related to evaluating and recording related party transactions 

16 

The Company is not required by
current SEC rules to include, and does not include, an auditor's attestation report. The Company's registered public accounting firm has
not attested to Management's reports on the Company's internal control over financial 

 reporting. As of September 30, 2022 no changes have occurred. 

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 

No change in the Company s
internal control over financial reporting occurred during the period ended September 30, 2022, that materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

 We are subject
to certain claims and litigation in the ordinary course of business. It is the opinion of management that the outcome of such matters
will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS 

The Company is a smaller reporting company and is therefore
not required to provide this information. 

ITEM 2 - UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE
OF PROCEEDS 

All unregistered sales of the Company s
securities have been disclosed on the Company s current reports on Form 10Q, 10K and form 8-K.
