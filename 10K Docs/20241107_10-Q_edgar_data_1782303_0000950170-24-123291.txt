 on April 10, 2018 and is headquartered in San Diego, California. Initial Public Offering On April 2, 2024, the Company completed its initial public offering (IPO), pursuant to which it sold shares of its common stock at a public offering price of per share, resulting in net proceeds of approximately million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and other offering expenses. Immediately prior to the closing of the IPO, the Company s outstanding convertible preferred stock automatically converted into shares of common stock. Following the closing of the IPO, no shares of convertible preferred stock were authorized or outstanding. In connection with the closing of its IPO, on April 2, 2024, the Company s certificate of incorporation was amended and restated to authorize shares of common stock, par value per share, and shares of undesignated preferred stock, par value of per share. Reverse Stock Split Accordingly, all share and per share amounts for all periods presented in the accompanying financial statements and notes thereto have been adjusted retroactively, where applicable, to reflect this reverse stock split and adjustment of the conversion ratios for each series of the Company s convertible preferred stock. The par value and the number of authorized shares of the convertible preferred stock and common stock were not adjusted in connection with the reverse stock split. Liquidity Since the Company commenced operations in 2018, it has devoted substantially all of its efforts and resources to organizing and staffing the Company, business planning, raising capital, building its proprietary Spyglass platform, discovering its ecDTx, developing its ecDNA diagnostic candidate, establishing its intellectual property portfolio, conducting research, preclinical studies, and clinical trials, establishing arrangements with third parties for the manufacture of its ecDTx and related raw materials, and providing other general and administrative support for these operations. Since inception, the Company has incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from its operations and expects that it will continue to do so into the foreseeable future as it continues its development of, seeks regulatory approval for, and potentially commercializes any of its ecDTx and seeks to discover and develop additional ecDTx, utilizes third parties to manufacture its ecDTx and related raw materials, seeks to develop its ecDNA diagnostic candidate, hires additional personnel, and expands and protects its intellectual property. If the Company obtains regulatory approval for any of its ecDTx, it expects to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing, and distribution. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of million and cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of million. The Company believes that its existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund its operations for at least 12 months from the issuance date of these unaudited condensed financial statements. Basis of Presentation The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) and the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for interim reporting. As permitted under those rules, certain footnotes or other financial information that are normally required by U.S. GAAP can be condensed or omitted. The financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars. Any reference in these notes to applicable guidance is meant to refer to U.S. GAAP as found in the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) and Accounting Standards Updates (ASU) promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).

million as of September 30, 2024. Management believes that the Company is not exposed to significant credit risk due to the financial position of the depository institutions in which those deposits are held.

On September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the remaining contractual maturities of all the Company s available-for-sale investments were less than 12 months. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company has not established an allowance for credit losses for any of its available-for-sale securities. As of September 30, 2024, there were available-for-sale securities in gross unrealized loss positions. As of December 31, 2023, there were available-for-sale securities, with an estimated fair value of million in gross unrealized loss positions. Based on its review of these investments as of December 31, 2023, the Company believed that the unrealized losses as of December 31, 2023 reflected the impact of the rising interest rate environment and were not other-than-temporary in nature.

 days after the lease commencement date for the 2024 Lease (see below). The 2022 Lease provides for the rental of lab and office space, contains rent escalation provisions, and requires the Company to pay a portion of the operating costs related to the underlying multitenant facility. Rental payments under the 2022 Lease commenced in mid-January 2022. Based on information obtained from its landlord, the Company has recorded a right-of-use (ROU) asset and an associated lease obligation for the lab and office space leased under the 2022 Lease. The net ROU asset of million and associated lease obligation of million are reflected in the Company s balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 and are estimates that will change should there be a change in the anticipated occupancy date of the property and associated campus underlying the 2024 Lease. The Company s estimated incremental borrowing rate of approximately was used in its present value calculation as the 2022 Lease does not have a stated rate and the implicit rate was not readily determinable. The Company paid million in cash for operating lease liabilities under the 2022 Lease, which is included in the operating activities section of the condensed statements of cash flows, during each of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. As of September 30, 2024, future minimum lease payments under the 2022 Lease are expected to total million. All future payments under the 2022 Lease are expected to occur in 2024. 2024 Lease In December 2021, the Company entered into a non-cancelable facility lease for approximately square feet of lab and office space in La Jolla, California (the 2024 Lease). The facility to be occupied by the Company under the 2024 Lease will be built to the Company s specifications; the 2024 Lease includes tenant improvement allowances totaling million, repayment of which is included in the future minimum lease payments called for thereunder. As of September 30, 2024, although construction of the property underlying the 2024 Lease was underway, the commencement date of the 2024 Lease had not yet been determined. The 2024 Lease has a 120-month term from the lease commencement date, with payments under the lease commencing after a six-month rent abatement period and continuing through the conclusion of the term. As of September 30, 2024, the landlord had advised the Company that this property would be available for occupancy in November 2024. For additional information, see Note 13. The 2024 Lease includes base lease payments totaling million, as well as additional payment obligations for common area maintenance and property taxes. The Company has the right to extend the term of the 2024 Lease for an additional months. The Company made an upfront payment under the 2024 Lease of million, which is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Additionally, as a security deposit under the 2024 Lease, the Company is required to maintain a standby letter-of-credit in the amount of million, which must remain in place until November 2034.

. The Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, restricted stock, dividend equivalents, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, and other stock or cash-based awards to the Company's employees, consultants, and directors. Options granted under the Plan are exercisable at various dates as determined upon grant and will expire no more than from their date of grant. Stock options generally vest over terms of either or . The exercise price of awards granted under the Plan shall not be less than of the estimated fair market value of the Company s common stock on the date of grant. In addition, the Plan includes an evergreen provision whereby the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the Plan will be increased annually on the first day of each calendar year during the term of the Plan, beginning in 2025, by an amount equal to the lesser of (i) of the shares of common stock outstanding on the final day of the immediately preceding calendar year or (ii) such number of shares as determined by the Company s board of directors or an authorized committee of the board of directors. As of September 30, 2024, a total of shares of common stock were authorized for issuance under the Plan. On September 30, 2024, of these shares were available for grant under the Plan. Prior to the adoption of the Plan, the Company had awarded common stock options under the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (as amended, the Predecessor Plan). Under the provisions of the Plan, the shares subject to awards issued under the Predecessor Plan that were outstanding as of March 27, 2024, the effective date of the Plan, and that are subsequently cancelled or forfeited, will become available for issuance under, and will increase the number of shares that may be issued under, the Plan. Repricing of Outstanding Options In August 2024, the compensation committee of the Company s board of directors, as administrator of the Plan and the Predecessor Plan, approved an option repricing, which was effective on August 19, 2024 (the Effective Date). The repricing applied to options to purchase up to an aggregate of shares of the Company s common stock with an exercise price per share in excess of the closing price per share of the Company s common stock on the Effective Date, held by eligible employees of the Company that were granted under the Plan or the Predecessor Plan and were outstanding as of the Effective Date (the Repriced Options). As of the Effective Date, the exercise price of each of the Repriced Options was reduced to per share, which was the closing price of the Company s common stock on the Effective Date; provided, however, that if prior to the Premium End Date (as defined below), a Repriced Option is exercised or an employee s employment or service with the Company terminates for any reason other than due to a Qualifying Termination (as defined below), the exercise price per share that applied to the Repriced Option immediately prior to the Effective Date will apply in lieu of the reduced exercise price. The Premium End Date means the earliest of: (1) August 19, 2026, (2) the date immediately prior to the closing of a Change in Control (as defined in the Plan), or (3) the date of the employee s Qualifying Termination. A Qualifying Termination means (a) the involuntary termination of the employee s employment by the Company due to a reduction in force (and other than for Cause (as defined in the Plan)), subject to the employee s execution of an effective general release of claims in favor of the Company, (b) the employee s death, or (c) termination of the employee s employment by the Company following the employee s Disability (as defined in the Plan). Except for the reduction in the exercise prices of the Repriced Options as described above, the Repriced Options retain their existing terms, including their respective original vesting schedules. The repricing resulted in a total incremental non-cash stock-based compensation expense of , which was calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, of which is associated with vested Repriced Options and will be recognized on a straight-line basis through the Premium End Date. The remaining of the incremental non-cash stock-based compensation expense is associated with unvested Repriced Options and will be recognized as follows: (i) if the Premium End Date occurs later than the end of the remaining vesting period of the Repriced Option, the incremental cost will be amortized on a straight-line basis through

 Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage oncology company dedicated to unlocking a new paradigm in cancer therapeutics that addresses the significant unmet need in patients with oncogene amplified tumors by targeting ecDNA, a root cause of oncogene amplification observed in more than 14 of cancer patients. Using our proprietary Spyglass platform, we identify targets essential for ecDNA functionality in cancer cells, then design and develop ecDTx to inhibit those targets with the aim to prevent cancer cells from using ecDNA to grow, adapt, and become resistant to existing therapies. Instead of directly targeting the proteins produced by amplified oncogenes, like the approach of traditional targeted therapies, our ecDTx are intended to be synthetic lethal in tumor cells reliant on ecDNA. They are designed to disrupt the underlying cellular machinery that enables ecDNA to function properly, such as proteins essential for ecDNA replication, transcription, assembly, repair, and segregation. 
 Our lead ecDTx, BBI-355, is a novel, oral, selective small molecule inhibitor of checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) being studied in the ongoing first-in-human, Phase 1/2 POTENTIATE clinical trial in patients with oncogene amplified cancers (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT05827614). As of September 30, 2024, no new safety signals have been observed. Based on current projections, we expect to have preliminary clinical proof-of-concept safety and antitumor activity data from the POTENTIATE trial in the second half of 2025. 
 Our second ecDTx, BBI-825, is a novel, oral, selective small molecule inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) being studied in the ongoing first-in-human, Phase 1/2 STARMAP clinical trial in colorectal cancer patients with BRAF V600E or KRAS G12C mutations and resistance oncogene amplifications (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT06299761). Multiple dose levels have been completed in the single-agent, dose-escalation portion of the trial and, to date, BBI-825 has demonstrated oral bioavailability and has been generally well-tolerated. We expect to have preliminary clinical proof-of-concept safety and antitumor data from the STARMAP trial in the second half of 2025. 
 Our third ecDTx program, in the drug discovery stage, is directed at a previously undrugged kinesin target essential for ecDNA segregation and inheritance during cell division. We are advancing this program through drug discovery to candidate identification and expect to submit an Investigational New Drug application (IND) in the first half of 2026. 
 16 

Through our Spyglass platform, we are able to identify and preclinically validate additional ecDNA-essential targets. In addition to our three ecDTx programs described above, we have preclinically validated multiple additional ecDNA targets and have initiated ecDTx drug discovery efforts to identify candidates against such targets. To date, all of our ecDTx have been discovered internally, and we retain global rights for all of our programs. 
 To assist in identifying patients that may benefit from our ecDTx, we have developed an ecDNA diagnostic test, internally called ECHO (ecDNA Harboring Oncogenes), to detect ecDNA in patient tumor samples via routine next generation sequencing (NGS) assays. In partnership with an in vitro diagnostic company, we developed and analytically validated the ecDNA diagnostic test for use as a clinical trial assay in the PONTENTIATE trial. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has determined that the ecDNA diagnostic is a non-significant risk device when used in patient selection for the POTENTIATE trial, meaning that FDA approval of an investigational device exemption is not required for the use of the ecDNA diagnostic in this trial. We have received institutional review board approval for use of the ecDNA diagnostic as a clinical trial assay in the POTENTIATE trial. 
 Since we commenced operations in 2018, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts and resources to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, building our proprietary Spyglass platform, discovering our ecDTx, developing our ecDNA diagnostic candidate, establishing our intellectual property portfolio, conducting research, preclinical studies, and clinical trials, establishing arrangements with third parties for the manufacture of our ecDTx and related raw materials, and providing general and administrative support for these operations. 
 We have incurred significant operating losses since our inception and, as of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 185.0 million. We expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and anticipate these losses will increase substantially as we continue our development of, seek regulatory approval for, and potentially commercialize any of our ecDTx, seek to discover and develop additional ecDTx, develop our ecDNA diagnostic, conduct our ongoing and planned clinical trials and preclinical studies, continue our research and development activities, utilize third parties to manufacture our ecDTx and related raw materials, hire additional personnel, seek to expand and protect our intellectual property, as well as incur additional costs associated with being a public company. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our ecDTx, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing, and distribution. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending on the timing of our clinical trials, preclinical studies, and our other research and development activities and capital expenditures. 
 In April 2024, we completed our initial public offering (IPO) pursuant to which we sold 6,250,000 shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of 100.0 million. Through September 30, 2024, we have raised a total of 353.6 million to fund our operations primarily from the gross proceeds from the sale and issuance of our convertible preferred stock and from our IPO. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of 167.1 million. In August 2024, we announced our intention to scale back our early discovery efforts, including a modest reduction in workforce, to extend our operating runway and had implemented these planned cost reduction measures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon our current operating plans, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund our operations into the fourth quarter of 2026. 
 We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue to date. We do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our ecDTx, which we expect will take a number of years and which may never occur. We will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our long-term business plan, including to complete the development and commercialization of our ecDTx, if approved. Accordingly, until such time as we can generate significant revenue from sales of our ecDTx, if ever, we expect to finance our cash needs through equity offerings, debt financings, or other capital sources, including potential collaborations, licenses, and other similar arrangements. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and could force us to delay, limit, reduce, or terminate our research and development programs or other operations, or grant rights to develop and market ecDTx that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. 
 We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our ecDTx for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if any of our ecDTx obtain marketing approval. We are working with our current manufacturers to ensure that we will be able to scale up our manufacturing capabilities to support our clinical plans. In addition, we rely on third parties to package, label, store, and distribute our ecDTx, and we intend to rely on third parties for our commercial products if marketing approval is obtained. We believe that this strategy allows us to maintain a more efficient infrastructure by eliminating the need for us to invest in our own manufacturing facilities, equipment, and personnel while also enabling us to focus our expertise and resources on the discovery and development of our ecDTx. 
 Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 To date, we have not generated any revenue from the sale of products. We do not expect to generate any such revenue unless and until such time that our ecDTx have advanced through clinical development and regulatory approval, if ever. If we fail to complete 
 17 

preclinical and clinical development of ecDTx or obtain regulatory approval for them, our ability to generate future revenues, and our results of operations and financial position would be adversely affected. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Our operating expenses consist of research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses. 
 Research and Development 
 Our research and development (R D) expenses have related primarily to the building of our Spyglass platform, our ecDTx discovery efforts, our preclinical and clinical development activities, and the development of an ecDNA diagnostic test. Our R D expenses consist of: 
 direct program costs, including: 

costs incurred under agreements with our contract research organizations (CROs), investigative sites, and consultants to conduct our clinical trials and preclinical studies, as well as third party costs related to the development of an ecDNA diagnostic test, 

expenses related to manufacturing our ecDTx for clinical trials and preclinical studies, including fees paid to third-party manufacturers; and 

indirect costs, including: 

personnel-related costs, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, travel, and stock-based compensation expenses for employees engaged in research and development functions, 

the costs of outside services from third parties, including consultants, 

the costs of lab and pharmacology supplies, 

facilities-related costs, including rent and maintenance costs, and other costs including insurance, depreciation, supplies, and miscellaneous expenses, and 

other costs, including costs related to travel, repairs and maintenance, service contracts, computer supplies, software, and publications and subscription services. 

R D expenses are recognized as incurred, and payments made prior to the receipt of goods or services to be used in R D are capitalized until the goods or services are received. We use internal resources primarily to conduct our research and discovery activities, as well as for managing our preclinical development, process development, manufacturing, and clinical development activities. We track direct costs on a development program specific basis. Indirect costs are not included in program costs, as these costs are general in nature and benefit all of our discovery efforts and development programs. 
 Although R D activities are central to our business model, the successful development of our ecDTx is highly uncertain. There are numerous factors associated with the successful development of any ecDTx, including future trial design and various regulatory requirements, many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time based on our stage of development. In addition, future regulatory factors beyond our control may impact our clinical development programs. Product candidates in later stages of development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of development. As a result, we expect that our R D expenses will increase substantially for the foreseeable future as we continue to conduct our ongoing R D activities, advance preclinical research programs toward clinical development, conduct clinical trials, hire additional personnel, and maintain, expand, protect, and enforce our intellectual property portfolio. 
 Our future R D expenses may vary significantly based on a wide variety of factors such as: 
 the number, scope, rate of progress, expense, and results of our discovery and preclinical activities and clinical trials; 

per patient trial costs; 

the number of trials required for approval; 

the number of sites included in the trials; 

the countries in which the trials are conducted; 

the length of time required to enroll eligible patients; 

the cost of developing an ecDNA diagnostic test; 

the number of patients that participate in the trials; 

18 

the number of doses that patients receive; 

the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients; 

the potential additional safety monitoring requested by regulatory agencies; 

the duration of patient participation in the trials and follow-up; 

the cost and timing of manufacturing our ecDTx; 

the phase of development of our ecDTx; 

the extent of changes in government regulation and regulatory guidance; 

the efficacy and safety profile of our ecDTx; 

the timing, receipt, and terms of any approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; and 

the extent to which we establish collaboration, license, or other arrangements. 

A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to development of any of our ecDTx could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that ecDTx. 
 The process of conducting the necessary preclinical and clinical research to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming. The actual probability of success for our current ecDTx or any future ecDTx may be affected by a variety of factors. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our ecDTx. Preclinical and clinical development timelines, the probability of success, and total development costs can differ materially from expectations. We anticipate that we will make determinations as to which ecDTx to pursue and how much funding to direct to each ecDTx on an ongoing basis in response to the results of ongoing and future preclinical studies and clinical trials, regulatory developments, and our ongoing assessments as to each ecDTx s commercial potential. We will need to raise substantial additional capital in the future. In addition, we cannot forecast which ecDTx may be subject to future collaborations, when such arrangements will be secured, if at all, and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative (G A) expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, travel, and stock-based compensation expenses for employees in executive, accounting and finance, business development, legal, and other administrative functions. Other significant costs include allocated facility-related costs, legal fees relating to intellectual property and corporate matters, professional fees for accounting and consulting services, insurance costs, and business development expenses. 
 We expect that our G A expenses will increase substantially for the foreseeable future as we continue to increase our G A headcount to support our continued R D activities and, if any ecDTx receive marketing approval, commercialization activities, as well as to support our operations generally. We also expect to incur increased expenses related to audit, legal, regulatory, and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with securities exchange listing and SEC requirements, director and officer insurance premiums, and investor relations costs associated with operating as a public company. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and investments.

R D expenses were 14.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 11.6 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in R D expenses was primarily due to a 1.9 million increase in direct program costs for our BBI-355, BBI-825, and other development programs, a 0.5 million increase in personnel-related costs due to an increase in personnel and annual salary increases, and 0.4 million of additional stock-based compensation, partially offset by a 0.5 million decrease in third-party services and other miscellaneous R D costs. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 G A expenses were 4.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.3 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in G A expenses was due to a 0.4 million increase in personnel-related costs resulting from an increase in personnel and annual salary increases, 0.7 million of additional stock-based compensation, and a 0.5 million increase in other G A costs; partially offset by a decrease in professional service fees of 0.3 million. 
 Other Income, Net 
 Other income, net was 2.2 million and 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 0.4 million increase resulted from the additional interest income generated by our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio due to the net proceeds from the sale of our common stock in our IPO in April 2024, as well as the increase in market yields available for such investment securities in comparison to the prior year period.

R D expenses were 42.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 32.2 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in R D expenses was primarily due to a 6.4 million increase in the direct program costs for our BBI-355, BBI-825, and other development programs, a 1.8 million increase in personnel-related costs resulting from an increase in headcount and salary increases, 1.2 million of additional stock-based compensation, and a 0.4 million increase in third-party services and other miscellaneous R D costs. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 G A expenses were 13.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 8.8 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in G A expenses was primarily due to a 1.1 million increase in personnel-related costs due to an increase in headcount and salary increases, 1.9 million of additional stock-based compensation, an increase in professional service fees of 0.4 million, and a 0.8 million increase in other G A costs. 
 Other Income, Net 
 Other income, net was 6.1 million and 3.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 2.4 million increase resulted from the additional interest income generated by our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio due to the net proceeds from the sale of our common stock in our IPO in April 2024, as well as the increase in market yields available for such investment securities in comparison to the prior year period.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 Through September 30, 2024, we have raised a total of 353.6 million to fund our operations primarily from the gross proceeds from the sale and issuance of our convertible preferred stock and the sale and issuance of 6,250,000 shares of our common stock in our IPO in April 2024 for gross proceeds of 100.0 million. 
 Future Funding Requirements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of 167.1 million. Based upon our current operating plans, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund our operations into the fourth quarter of 2026. However, our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could deplete our capital resources sooner than we expect. Additionally, the process of conducting preclinical studies, manufacturing ecDTx, developing our ecDNA diagnostic, and testing ecDTx in clinical trials is costly, and the timing of progress and expenses in these studies and trials is uncertain. 
 We have incurred significant operating losses since our inception and, as of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 185.0 million. We expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and we anticipate these losses will increase substantially as we continue our development of, seek regulatory approval for, and potentially commercialize any of our ecDTx, seek to discover and develop additional ecDTx, develop our ecDNA diagnostic, conduct our ongoing and planned clinical trials and preclinical studies, continue our research and development activities, utilize third parties to manufacture our ecDTx and related raw materials, hire additional personnel, seek to expand and protect our intellectual property, as well as incur additional costs associated with being a public company. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our ecDTx, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing, and distribution. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending on the timing of our clinical trials, preclinical studies, and our other research and development activities and capital expenditures. 
 Our future capital requirements are difficult to predict and depend on many factors, including but not limited to: 
 the initiation, type, number, scope, progress, expansions, results, costs, and timing of clinical trials and preclinical studies of our ecDTx that we are pursuing or may choose to pursue in the future, including the costs of any third-party products used as combination agents in our combination clinical trials; 

the costs and timing of manufacturing for our ecDTx, including commercial manufacture at sufficient scale, if any ecDTx is approved; 

the costs and timing of developing ecDNA diagnostics, if required, and the outcome of their regulatory review; 

the costs, timing, and outcome of regulatory meetings and reviews of our ecDTx; 

the costs of obtaining, maintaining, enforcing, and protecting our patents and other intellectual property and proprietary rights; 

our efforts to enhance operational systems and hire additional personnel to satisfy our obligations as a public company, including enhanced internal control over financial reporting; 

the costs associated with hiring additional personnel and consultants as our clinical and preclinical activities increase and as we operate as a public company; 

the costs and timing of establishing or securing sales and marketing capabilities if any ecDTx is approved; 

our ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance, coverage, and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors and adequate market share and revenue for any approved products; 

patients willingness to pay out-of-pocket for any approved products in the absence of coverage and/or adequate reimbursement from third-party payors; 

the terms and timing of establishing and maintaining collaborations, licenses, and other similar arrangements; 

costs associated with any products or technologies that we may in-license or acquire; and 

the effects of competing technological and market developments as well as disruptions to and volatility in the credit and financial markets. 

22 

We have no committed sources of capital. Until we can generate sufficient product revenue to finance our cash requirements, if ever, we expect to finance our future cash needs primarily through equity offerings, debt financings, or other capital sources, including potential collaborations, licenses, and other similar arrangements. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be or could be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through other collaborations or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our future revenue streams, ecDTx, research programs, intellectual property or proprietary technology, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce, or terminate our R D programs or other operations, or grant rights to develop and market ecDTx to third parties that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves, or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose.

Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 45.3 million and 35.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The net cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to our reported net loss of 48.9 million, net of noncash charges (including stock-based compensation expense, depreciation, and right-of-use asset amortization) totaling 4.2 million and a 0.6 million increase of our net operating assets. The net cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to our reported net loss of 37.3 million and a 0.6 million increase in our net operating assets, adjusted for noncash charges (including stock-based compensation expense, depreciation) totaling 2.7 million. The increase in cash used in operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 in comparison to the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to higher personnel-related costs and an increase in third-party spending associated with our discovery, development, and clinical activities. 
 Investing Activities 
 Investing activities consist primarily of the cash flows of purchases and maturities of investment securities and the cash outflow associated with purchases of property and equipment. Such activities resulted in a net outflow of funds of approximately 27.9 million and 54.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily from the net purchases of our available-for-sale securities portfolio. 
 Financing Activities 
 Our financing activities consist of the proceeds from sales of our common and convertible preferred stock and, to a lesser extent, the exercise of common stock options by our employees and consultants. Net cash provided by financing activities was 89.7 million and 99.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in cash provided by financing activities for the first nine months of 2024 was primarily due to the net proceeds from our IPO. The increase in cash provided by financing activities for the first nine months of 2023 was primarily the result of the net proceeds from the sale of our Series C convertible preferred stock. 
 Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments 
 We lease office and lab space under lease agreements with varying expiration dates through 2034. As of September 30, 2024, total future aggregate operating lease commitments was 72.3 million, which is exclusive of variable lease payments for common area maintenance and property taxes under the 2024 Lease. During the normal course of our business, we enter into contracts for research 
 23 

and professional services, and for the purchase of lab supplies used in our research activities. These contracts generally provide for termination after a notice period, and, therefore, are cancelable contracts and not separately presented. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 Since our inception, we have not had, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined under rules and regulations of the SEC. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates and Judgments 
 Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to accrued expenses and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from those described in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates and Judgments included in the Prospectus, except that from the effectiveness date of our registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-277696), we have a publicly traded stock price and no longer require common stock valuations. 
 Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status 
 As an emerging growth company under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act), we can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This period allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. We also intend to rely on other exemptions provided by the JOBS Act, including without limitation, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley for so long as we are exempt from doing so. 
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) December 31, 2029, which is the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the consummation of our IPO; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least 1.235 billion; (iii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded 700.0 million as of the last business day of the second fiscal quarter of such year; or (iv) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. 
 We are also a smaller reporting company as defined in the Exchange Act. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company even after we are no longer an emerging growth company. We may take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies and will be able to take advantage of these scaled disclosures for so long as our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than 250.0 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter, or our annual revenue is less than 100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700.0 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter. 
 Ite m 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act and in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, and are not required to provide the information under this item. 
 Ite m 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation and supervision of our principal executive officer and our principal financial and accounting officer, have evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the 
 24 

Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial and accounting officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Due to a transition period established by SEC rules applicable to newly public companies, our management is not required to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until after the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2025. As a result, this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q does not address whether there have been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting. 
 25 

PART II OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Ite m 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 There currently is no material pending legal proceeding to which we are a party or to which any of our property is subject, and our management is not aware of any contemplated proceeding by any governmental authority against us. From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings or subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of business. Regardless of outcome, such proceedings or claims can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of resources, negative publicity, reputational harm, and other factors and there can be no assurances that favorable outcomes will be obtained. 
 Ite m 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described in Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, together with all of the information in this Quarterly Report and the Prospectus, before making an investment decision to purchase or sell shares of our common stock. If any of those risks are realized, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. 
 Ite m 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 (a) Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities. 

None. 
 (b) Use of Proceeds. 

On March 27, 2024, our registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-277696), as amended, was declared effective by the SEC for our IPO. There has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds from the IPO from that described in the Prospectus. 
 (c) Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. 

Not applicable. 
 Ite m 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. 
 None. 
 Ite m 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. 
 Not applicable. 
 Ite m 5. Other Information.

If a deemed modification is not satisfactory in the judgment of such arbitrator or court, the unenforceable provision shall be deemed deleted, and the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not be affected thereby. 
 8.	 Interpretation; Construction . The headings set forth in this Release are for convenience only and shall not be used in interpreting this Release. This Release has been drafted by legal counsel representing the Company, but Employee has participated in the negotiation of its terms.

 5
