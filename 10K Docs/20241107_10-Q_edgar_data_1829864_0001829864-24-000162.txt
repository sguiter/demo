 CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this "Quarterly Report") contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward looking statements may also be contained in our other reports filed under Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), which involve certain known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts. In some cases, you can identify these forward-looking statements by the use of words such as "outlook," "believes," "expects," "potential," "continues," "may," "will," "should," "could," "seeks," "predicts," "intends," "trends," "plans," "estimates," "anticipates," "position us," or the negative version of these words or other comparable words. Such forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated in these statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date the statement was made. We assume no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. 
 Our actual results may differ significantly from any results expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. A summary of the principal risk factors that might cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements is set forth below. The following is only a summary of the principal risks that may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included in this Quarterly Report and the Company's other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), and the more complete discussion of the risk factors we face, which are set forth under Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (our "Annual Report") as filed with the SEC, as such risk factors may be updated from time to time in our periodic filings with the SEC, which are accessible on the SEC s website at www.sec.gov. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 Our business is dependent on key clients, and the loss of a key client could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 Our clients may terminate contracts before completion or choose not to renew contracts and loss of business or non-payment from clients could materially affect our results of operations. 
 We may fail to cost-effectively acquire and retain new clients, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 If we provide inadequate service or cause disruptions in our clients businesses or fail to comply with the quality standards required by our clients under our agreements, it could result in significant costs to us, the loss of our clients and damage to our corporate reputation. 
 Utilization of artificial intelligence by our clients or our failure to incorporate artificial intelligence into our operations could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results. 
 Our business prospects will suffer if we are unable to continue to anticipate our clients needs by adapting to market and technology trends, investing in technology as it develops, and adapting our services and solutions to changes in technology and client expectations. 
 Unauthorized or improper disclosure of personal or other sensitive information, or security breaches and incidents, whether inadvertent or purposeful, including as the result of a cyber-attack, could result in liability and harm our reputation, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 Trust and Safety, including content monitoring and moderation services, is a large portion of our business. The long-term impacts on the mental health and well-being of our employees doing this work are unknown. This work may lead to stress disorders and may create liabilities for us. This work is also subject to significant press and regulatory scrutiny. As a result, we may be subject to negative publicity or liability, or face difficulties recruiting and retaining employees, any of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our failure to detect and deter criminal or fraudulent activities or other misconduct by our employees, or third parties such as contractors and consultants that may have access to our data, could result in loss of trust from our clients and negative publicity, which would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 Global economic and political conditions, especially in the social media and meal delivery and transport industries from which we generate significant revenue, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 
 Our business is heavily dependent upon our international operations, particularly in the Philippines and India, and any disruption to those operations would adversely affect us. 
 Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. federal and state, as well as international laws and regulations, including those regarding data privacy and security, and we or our clients may be subject to regulations related to the processing of certain types of sensitive and confidential information. Any failure to comply with applicable data privacy and security laws and regulations could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Fluctuations against the U.S. dollar in the local currencies in the countries in which we operate could have a material effect on our results of operations. 
 Our business depends on a strong brand and corporate reputation, and if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, our ability to expand our client base could be impaired and our business and operating results will be adversely affected. 
 Pricing pressure may reduce our revenue or gross profits and adversely affect our financial results. 
 Our results of operations have been, and could in the future be, adversely affected by volatile, unfavorable or uncertain economic and political conditions, particularly in the markets in which our clients and operations are concentrated, and the effects of these conditions on our clients businesses. 
 The success of our business depends on our senior management and key employees. 
 Increases in employee expenses as well as changes to labor laws could reduce our profit margin. 
 We may fail to attract, hire, train and retain sufficient numbers of skilled employees in a timely fashion at our sites to support our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 We may face difficulties as we expand our operations into countries or industries in which we have no prior operating experience and in which we may be subject to increased business, economic and regulatory risks that could impact our results of operations. 
 Our business relies heavily on owned and third-party technology and computer systems, which subjects us to various uncertainties. 
 Our profitability will suffer if we are not able to maintain asset utilization levels, price appropriately and control our costs. 
 Certain investment funds associated with Blackstone Inc. and our Co-Founders control us and their interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future. 
 The dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our common stock prior to the completion of our June 2021 initial public offering, and it may depress the trading price of our Class A common stock. 
 The market price of shares of our Class A common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance, which could cause the value of your investment to decline. 
 We urge you to carefully consider the foregoing summary together with the risks discussed under "Risk Factors" in the Annual Report, and in Part I, Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Quarterly Report.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this "Quarterly Report"), the financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the "Annual Report"), as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and the information included under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Annual Report. In addition to historical data, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in our forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those discussed under "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" in this Quarterly Report and under Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in the Annual Report. 
 This Quarterly Report includes certain historical consolidated financial and other data for TaskUs, Inc. ("we," "us," "our" or the "Company"). The following discussion provides a narrative of our results of operations and financial condition for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 We are a provider of outsourced digital services and next-generation customer experience to the world's most innovative companies, helping our clients represent, protect and grow their brands. We serve our clients to support their end customers urgent needs, navigate an increasingly complex compliance landscape, handle sensitive tasks including online content moderation, and enable artificial intelligence technology and automation. 
 Our global, omni-channel delivery model is focused on providing our clients three key services Digital Customer Experience ("Digital CX"), Trust and Safety, and Artificial Intelligence ("AI") Services. We have designed our platform to enable us to rapidly scale and benefit from our clients growth. We believe our ability to deliver ridiculously good outsourcing will enable us to continue to grow our client base. We use our strong reputation and expertise serving the digital economy to attract new innovators and enterprise-class brands looking to transform. 
 At TaskUs, culture is at the heart of everything we do. Many of the companies operating in the digital economy are well-known for their obsession with creating a world-class employee experience. We believe clients choose TaskUs in part because they view our company culture as aligned with their own, which enables us to act as a natural extension of their brands and gives us an advantage in the recruitment of highly engaged frontline teammates who produce better results. 
 2024 Developments 
 Return to Revenue Growth 
 During 2024, we have seen some of the challenges and market uncertainty we faced in 2023 begin to subside. Through our continued focus on partnering with our clients and strategic investments we have made in sales and marketing, including our focus on landing enterprise clients and cross-selling our specialized services, we achieved revenue growth of 13.2 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Given our performance in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we expect our revenue growth to continue in the remainder of 2024. This acceleration of revenue growth requires additional investments in operations, facilities, hiring and training. Additionally, we have seen an increase in pricing pressure as our clients remain focused on cost reduction and competitors reduce their rates. While we believe we are a premium provider of specialized services, we have and expect to continue to price our services competitively in order to achieve above market growth rates and take share from our competitors. These factors may impact our margins and cash flow. 
 Recent Financial Highlights 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded service revenue of 255.3 million, a 13.2 increase from 225.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded service revenue of 720.7 million, a 4.4 increase from 690.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 12.7 million from 9.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase is due primarily to revenue growth, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes, including forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments, and interest income. These increases were partially offset by higher cost of services and certain litigation costs. Adjusted Net Income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 14.4 to 34.3 million from 30.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 3.4 to 54.2 million from 52.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. For definitions and reconciliations to net income, the most directly comparable measure in accordance with GAAP, see "Non-GAAP Financial Measures." 
 
 Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 37.0 million from 29.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase is due primarily to revenue growth, lower stock-based compensation expense, earn-out consideration and severance, as well as higher interest income. These increases were partially offset by higher cost of services, certain litigation costs and bonus expense, associated with higher company performance. Adjusted Net Income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 4.4 to 90.2 million from 94.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 3.5 to 156.1 million from 161.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Service revenue by delivery geography 
 We deliver our services from multiple locations around the world; however, the majority of our service revenues are derived from contracts that require payment in United States dollars, regardless of whether the clients are located in the United States. 
 The following table presents the breakdown of our service revenue by geographical location, based on where the services are provided, for each period: 
 Three months ended September 30, Period over Period Change (in thousands, except 2024 2023 ) ) Philippines 143,300 126,419 16,881 13.4 United States 31,238 32,421 (1,183) (3.6) India 31,088 29,379 1,709 5.8 Rest of World 49,719 37,407 12,312 32.9 Service revenue 255,345 225,626 29,719 13.2 
 Philippines: Trust and Safety contributed 6.9 of the total increase primarily driven by clients in Social Media and FinTech. Digital Customer Experience contributed 5.8 of the total increase primarily driven by clients in FinTech and Entertainment + Gaming. AI Services contributed 0.7 of the total increase primarily driven by clients in On Demand Travel + Transportation. 
 United States: Digital Customer Experience contributed 15.5 of the total decrease primarily driven by clients in Entertainment + Gaming, Technology and On Demand Travel + Transportation. The decrease was partially offset by a 7.6 increase contributed by AI Services and a 4.3 increase contributed by Trust and Safety, primarily driven by clients in Social Media. 
 India: AI Services contributed 6.1 of the total increase primarily driven by clients in Social Media and Professional Services + Industry. Trust and Safety contributed 2.9 of the total increase primarily driven by clients in Social Media. The increase was partially offset by a 3.2 decrease contributed by Digital Customer Experience, primarily driven by clients in On Demand Travel + Transportation and FinTech, partially offset by clients in Retail + E Commerce. 
 Rest of World: Digital Customer Experience contributed 21.2 of the total increase primarily driven by clients in FinTech, Professional Services + Industry and On Demand Travel + Transportation. Trust and Safety contributed 10.8 of the total increase, primarily driven by clients in Social Media and FinTech. AI Services contributed 0.9 of the total increase. Growth in the Rest of World was led by Latin America and Europe. 
 Operating expenses 
 Cost of services 
 The increase was primarily driven by higher personnel costs of 17.4 million associated with increased headcount. The remaining increase included facilities and recruiting costs associated with site expansion and increasing headcount associated with accelerating growth. 
 Selling, general, and administrative expense 
 The increase was primarily driven by certain litigation costs of 4.4 million, which we expect to continue in future periods. The remaining increase includes higher personnel costs of 0.5 million, due primarily to an increase in headcount and bonus expense, associated with higher company performance, mostly offset by a reduction in stock-based compensation expense of 3.1 million.

 Loss (gain) on disposal of assets 
 Loss on disposal of assets for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was associated with optimizing our footprint in the United States. 
 Other expense, net 
 Changes are driven by our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk resulting from our operations in foreign geographies, primarily the Philippines, including economic hedges using foreign currency exchange rate forward contracts, as well as higher interest income. See Part I, Item 3., "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in this Quarterly Report for additional information on how foreign currency impacts our financial results. 
 Financing expenses 
 Changes in financing expense are primarily driven by payments on long-term debt and the rate of SOFR used to calculate the interest rate of our debt. 
 Provision for income taxes 
 The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 28.6 and 31.8 , respectively. Costs related to the issuance of stock-based compensation and litigation costs within the provision for income taxes calculation are adjusted for Non-GAAP purposes. If those costs are removed, the provision for income taxes would have been 6.1 million and 7.5 million and the effective tax rate would have been 18.6 and 26.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 Depreciation 
 The increase in depreciation is a result of capital expenditures for leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures and other office equipment associated with site expansions. These increases were mostly offset by a reduction in the pace of technology and computers purchases associated with certain employees returning to the office driving higher utilization of equipment. 
 Loss (gain) on disposal of assets 
 Loss on disposal of assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was associated with optimizing our footprint in the United States.

 Provision for income taxes 
 The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 33.8 and 37.9 , respectively. Costs related to the issuance of stock-based compensation, the acquisition of heloo, litigation costs and severance within the provision for income taxes calculation are adjusted for Non-GAAP purposes. If those costs are removed, the provision for income taxes would have been 22.8 million and 22.9 million and the effective tax rate would have been 23.7 and 23.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 Many of our clients are part of the rapidly growing digital economy and they rely on our suite of digital solutions to drive their continued success. For our existing clients, we benefit from our ability to grow as they grow and to cross sell new solutions, further deepening our entrenchment. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated 23 and 19 , respectively, of our service revenue from our largest client. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated 21 and 19 , respectively, of our service revenue from our largest client. 
 We continue to identify and target high growth industry verticals and clients. Our strategy is to acquire new clients and further grow with our existing ones in order to achieve meaningful client and revenue diversification over time. 
 
 Foreign Currency 
 As a global company, we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets, liabilities, revenue, operating expenses and cash flows that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into U.S. dollars. See Part I, Item 3., "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in this Quarterly Report for additional information on how foreign currency impacts our financial results.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We use Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Earnings Per Share ("EPS"), EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow and Conversion of Adjusted EBITDA, as key measures to assess the performance of our business. 
 Each of the measures are not recognized under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") and do not purport to be an alternative to net income or cash flow as a measure of our performance. Such measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider any of such measures in isolation or as substitutes for our results as reported under GAAP. Additionally, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA exclude items that can have a significant effect on our profit or loss and should, therefore, be used in conjunction with profit or loss for the period. Our management compensates for the limitations of using non-GAAP financial measures by using them to supplement GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business than GAAP results alone. Because not all companies use identical calculations, these measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. 
 Adjusted Net Income 
 Adjusted Net Income is a non-GAAP profitability measure that represents net income or loss for the period before the impact of amortization of intangible assets and certain items that are considered to hinder comparison of the performance of our businesses on a period-over-period basis or with other businesses. During the periods presented, we excluded from Adjusted Net Income amortization of intangible assets , transaction costs, earn-out consideration, the effect of foreign currency gains and losses, gains and losses on disposals of assets, non-recurring severance costs, certain non-recurring litigation costs, stock-based compensation expense and associated employer payroll tax and the related effect on income taxes of certain pre-tax adjustments, which include costs that are required to be expensed in accordance with GAAP. Our management believes that the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to net income applied in presenting Adjusted Net Income are appropriate to provide additional information to investors about certain material non-cash items and about unusual items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future.

 (8) Net Income Margin represents net income divided by service revenue and Adjusted Net Income Margin represents Adjusted Net Income divided by service revenue. 
 Adjusted EPS 
 Adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP profitability measure that represents earnings available to shareholders excluding the impact of certain items that are considered to hinder comparison of the performance of our business on a period-over-period basis or with other businesses. Adjusted EPS is calculated as Adjusted Net Income divided by our diluted weighted-average number of shares outstanding. Our management believes that the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to earnings per share applied in presenting Adjusted EPS are appropriate to provide additional information to investors about certain material non-cash items and about unusual items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future. 
 The following table reconciles GAAP diluted EPS, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to Adjusted EPS for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
 EBITDA is a non-GAAP profitability measure that represents net income or loss for the period before the impact of the benefit from or provision for income taxes, financing expenses, depreciation, and amortization of intangible assets. EBITDA eliminates potential differences in performance caused by variations in capital structures (affecting financing expenses), tax positions (such as the availability of net operating losses against which to relieve taxable profits), the cost and age of tangible assets (affecting relative depreciation expense) and the extent to which intangible assets are identifiable (affecting relative amortization expense). 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP profitability measure that represents EBITDA before certain items that are considered to hinder comparison of the performance of our businesses on a period-over-period basis or with other businesses. During the periods presented, we excluded from Adjusted EBITDA transaction costs, earn-out consideration, the effect of foreign currency gains and losses, gains and losses on disposals of assets, non-recurring severance costs, certain non-recurring litigation costs, stock-based compensation expense and associated employer payroll tax and interest income, which include costs that are required to be expensed in accordance with GAAP. Our management believes that the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to EBITDA applied in presenting Adjusted EBITDA are appropriate to provide additional information to investors about certain material non-cash items and about unusual items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future.

 Free Cash Flow 
 Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP liquidity measure that represents our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations. Free Cash Flow is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities in the period minus cash used for purchase of property and equipment in the period. Our management believes that the inclusion of this non-GAAP measure, when considered with our GAAP results, provides management and investors with an additional understanding of our ability to generate additional cash for ongoing business operations and other capital deployment. 
 The following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to Free Cash Flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling 180.4 million, which were held for working capital purposes, as well as the borrowing availability under the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility of 190.0 million. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our total indebtedness, net of debt financing fees was 259.4 million. The interest rate in effect for the 2022 Term Loan Facility as of September 30, 2024 was 6.954 per annum. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of September 30, 2024. See Note 8, "Long-Term Debt" in the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report for additional information regarding our debt. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 1,343,154 shares of our Class A common stock under the share repurchase program for 15.4 million, which we funded principally with available cash. As of September 30, 2024, 41.8 million remained available for share repurchases under our share repurchase program. For additional information about our share repurchase program, see Part II, Item 2., "Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities" in this Quarterly Report. 
 Historically, we have financed our operations and made investments in supporting the growth of our business primarily through cash provided by operations. We expect to continue to make similar investments in the future. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and our 2022 Credit Facilities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table presents a summary of our consolidated cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated: 
 Nine months ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 98,230 103,895 Net cash used in investing activities (18,821) (23,904) Net cash used in financing activities (21,254) (96,334) 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 98.2 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 103.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflects net income of 37.0 million and the add back for non-cash charges totaling 75.8 million, partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of 14.6 million. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of 32.0 million in stock-based compensation expense, 30.5 million of depreciation and 15.0 million of amortization related to intangibles. Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 reflects net income of 29.4 million, as well as the add back for non-cash charges totaling 94.1 million, partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of 19.6 million. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of 42.3 million in stock-based compensation expense, 29.5 million of depreciation and 15.3 million of amortization related to intangibles. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 18.8 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of 23.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Purchase of property and equipment decreased primarily due to lower site build-out costs. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 21.3 million compared to net cash used by financing activities of 96.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due primarily to lower payments to acquire shares under our share repurchase program.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Our activities expose us to a variety of financial risks: market risk (includes foreign currency), interest rate risk and credit risk. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 Our exposure to market risk arises principally from exchange rate risk. Although substantially all of our revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars, a substantial portion of our expenses were incurred and paid in the Philippine peso, Indian rupee, Mexican peso, and the Colombian peso, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. We also incur expenses in U.S. dollars, and currencies of the other countries in which we have operations. The exchange rates among the Philippine peso, Indian rupee, Mexican peso, Colombian peso and the U.S. dollar have changed substantially in recent years and may fluctuate substantially in the future. 
 The following table presents a summary of foreign currency exchange rates and changes for the periods indicated: 
 Philippine Peso Indian Rupee Mexican Peso Colombian Peso Average exchange rate against the U.S. dollar Nine months ended September 30, 2024 
 56.99 83.41 17.72 3,979.96 Nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 55.48 82.35 17.81 4,411.48 Depreciation (appreciation) 2.7 1.3 (0.5) (9.8) 
 Based on our level of operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and excluding any forward contract arrangements that we had in place during that period, a 10 appreciation (depreciation) of each foreign currency against the U.S. dollar would have increased (decreased) our expenses incurred and paid in that foreign currency as follows: 
 (in thousands) Philippine Peso Indian Rupee Mexican Peso Colombian Peso 10 appreciation 29,690 7,665 3,290 4,946 10 depreciation (24,292) (6,271) (2,692) (4,046) 
 In order to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuation risks and minimize the earnings and cash flow volatility associated with forecasted transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies, and economically hedge our intercompany balances and other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currencies, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts. 
 These contracts must be settled on the day of maturity or may be canceled subject to the receipts or payments of any gains or losses, respectively, equal to the difference between the contract exchange rate and the market exchange rate on the date of cancellation. We do not enter into foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes. These derivative instruments do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on the settlement of these derivatives are intended to offset payment for the transactions being hedged. 
 See Note 5, "Forward Contracts" in the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report for additional information regarding our forward contracts. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our exposure to market risk is influenced by the changes in interest rates paid on any outstanding balance on our borrowings, mainly under our 2022 Credit Facilities. All of our borrowings outstanding under the 2022 Credit Facilities as of September 30, 2024 accrue interest at SOFR plus 2.25 . As of September 30, 2024 our total principal balance outstanding was 260.5 million and the interest rate in effect was 6.954 per annum. Based on the outstanding balances and interest rates under the 2022 Credit Facilities as of September 30, 2024, a hypothetical 10 increase or decrease in SOFR would cause an increase or decrease in interest expense of approximately 1.2 million over the next 12 months.

Table of Contents 

 Credit Risk 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had accounts receivable, net of allowance for credit losses, of 200.8 million, of which 48.5 million was owed by one of our clients. Collectively, this client represented approximately 24 of our gross accounts receivable as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the design and operation of the our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to accomplish their objectives at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 (1) On May 8, 2023, the Company announced that the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a 100.0 million increase to the Company's share repurchase program, increasing the total authorization to 200.0 million, with the total amount remaining available after the increase being exclusive of any commissions, fees or excise taxes. Pursuant to our share repurchase program, we may repurchase shares of our Class A common stock from time to time through open market purchases, in privately negotiated transactions or by other means, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. Open market repurchases are expected to be structured to occur within the pricing volume requirements of Rule 10b-18. The timing and total amount of stock repurchases will depend upon, business, economic and market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements, prevailing stock prices, restrictions under the terms of our loan agreements and other relevant considerations. The repurchase program terminates on December 31, 2024, and may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire any amount of Class A common stock. 
 (2) Average price paid per share excludes commissions and other costs associated with the repurchases.
