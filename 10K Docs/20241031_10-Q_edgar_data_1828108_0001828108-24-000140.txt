 CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as may, might, possible, will, should, expect, plan, anticipate, could, intend, target, project, contemplate, believe, estimate, predict, potential or continue or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans or intentions. Forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report include statements about: 
 our ability to commercialize the Aurora Driver safely, quickly, and broadly on the timeline we expect; 
 the market for autonomous vehicles and our market position; 
 our ability to compete effectively with existing and new competitors; 
 the ability to maintain the listing of our Class A common stock and warrants on Nasdaq; 
 our ability to raise financing in the future; 
 anticipated trends, growth rates, and challenges in our business and in the markets in which we operate; 
 our ability to effectively manage our growth and future expenses; 
 the sufficiency of our cash and cash equivalents to meet our operating requirements; 
 our success in retaining or recruiting, or changes required in, our officers, key employees or directors; 
 the impact of the regulatory environment and complexities with compliance related to such environment; 
 our ability to successfully collaborate with business partners; 
 our ability to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property; 
 economic and industry trends or trend analysis; 
 the impact of infectious diseases, health epidemics and pandemics, natural disasters, war (including Russia s actions in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war), acts of terrorism or responses to these events; and 
 other factors detailed under the section entitled Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and this Quarterly Report. 
 We caution you that the foregoing list does not contain all of the forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report. 
 You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report primarily on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, including those described in the section titled Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report. We cannot assure you that the results, events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur, and actual results, events or circumstances could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. 
 Neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of any of these forward-looking statements. Moreover, the forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Quarterly Report or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law. You should not place undue reliance on our forward- looking statements. Our forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any future acquisitions, mergers, dispositions, joint ventures or investments we may make.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the condensed consolidated financial statements (unaudited) included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors, including those set forth in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report and Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors and under the heading Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. 
 Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, references to Aurora, we, us, our and other similar terms in this section refer to Aurora Innovation, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. Percentage amounts have not in all cases been calculated on the basis of rounded figures, but on the basis of such amounts prior to rounding. For this reason, percentage amounts may vary from those obtained by performing the same calculations using the figures in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Certain other amounts that appear in this Quarterly Report may not sum due to rounding. 
 
 Corporate History and Background 
 On November 3, 2021 (the Closing Date ), Aurora Innovation, Inc. (f/k/a Reinvent Technology Partners Y and referred to herein as the Company ), consummated a business combination with Aurora Innovation Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (f/k/a Aurora Innovation, Inc. and referred to herein as Legacy Aurora ), and RTPY Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the Company Merger Sub ), pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated July 14, 2021 (the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, the Merger ), by and among the Company, Legacy Aurora and Merger Sub. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, a business combination between the Company and Legacy Aurora was effected through the merger of Merger Sub with and into Legacy Aurora, with Legacy Aurora continuing as the surviving company and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. On the Closing Date, the Company changed its name from Reinvent Technology Partners Y to Aurora Innovation, Inc. 
 Aurora s Business 
 Aurora is developing the Aurora Driver based on what we believe to be the most advanced and scalable suite of self-driving hardware, software, and data services in the world to fundamentally transform the global transportation market. The Aurora Driver is designed as a platform to adapt and interoperate amongst vehicle types and applications. To date, it has been successfully integrated into numerous different vehicle platforms: from passenger vehicles to light commercial vehicles to Class 8 trucks. By creating one driver system for multiple vehicle types and use cases, Aurora s capabilities in one market reinforce and strengthen its competitive advantages in others. For example, highway driving capabilities developed for trucking will carry over to highway segments driven by passenger vehicles in ride-hailing applications. We believe this approach will enable us to target and transform the transportation landscape, including trucking, passenger mobility, and local goods delivery market. 
 We expect that the Aurora Driver will ultimately be commercialized in a Driver as a Service DaaS business model, in which customers or third parties will purchase, manage, and maintain fleets directly, while subscribing to the Aurora Driver and a suite of related services. We do not intend to own nor operate a large number of vehicles ourselves. Throughout commercialization, we expect to earn revenue on a fee per mile basis. We intend to partner with OEMs, Tier 1 automotive suppliers, fleet operators, and other third parties to commercialize and support Aurora Driver-powered vehicles. We expect that these strategic partners will support activities such as vehicle and hardware manufacturing, financing and leasing, service and maintenance, parts replacement, facility ownership and operation, and other commercial and operational services as needed. We expect this DaaS model to enable an asset-light and high margin revenue stream for Aurora, while allowing us to scale more rapidly through partnerships. During the start of commercialization, though, we expect to briefly operate our own logistics and mobility services, where we own or lease and operate a small fleet of vehicles equipped with our Aurora Driver. This level of control is useful during early commercialization as we define operational processes and playbooks for our partners.

 We plan to first launch Aurora Driver for Freight (formerly Aurora Horizon), our driverless trucking subscription service, as we believe that is where we can make the largest impact the fastest, given the massive industry demand, attractive unit economics, and the ability to deploy on high volume highway-focused routes. Future success will be dependent on our ability to execute against our product roadmap to launch Aurora Driver for Freight. From there, we plan to leverage the extensibility of the Aurora Driver to deploy and scale into the passenger mobility market with Aurora Driver for Rides (formerly Aurora Connect), our driverless ride hailing subscription service, and in the longer-term the local goods delivery market.

 The change in fair value of derivative liabilities was expense of 28 million and income of 5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily due to the change in the market price for the underlying instrument during each period. 
 Other income, net decreased by 1 million, or 6 , to 16 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 17 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in interest income earned on cash equivalents and investments.

 Operating expenses 
 Research and development expenses decreased by 41 million, or 8 , to 505 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 546 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by decreases in hardware costs for development fleets, non-cash stock-based compensation, and personnel costs. Research and development expenses included non-cash stock-based compensation of 93 million and 107 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 9 million, or 10 , to 82 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 91 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily driven by decreases in personnel costs and other general and administrative costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses included non-cash stock-based compensation of 16 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Other income (expense) 
 The change in fair value of derivative liabilities resulted in an expense of 15 million and 7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily due to the change in the market price for the underlying instrument. 
 Other income, net increased by 7 million, or 18 , to 47 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 40 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in interest income earned on cash equivalents and investments.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were 263 million of cash and cash equivalents, 985 million of short-term investments, and 104 million of long-term investments with maturities within 2 years, exclusive of restricted cash of 16 million. Short-term and long-term investments consist of primarily U.S. Treasury securities as well as corporate bonds and commercial paper. 
 We have incurred negative cash flows from operating activities and significant losses from operations in the past. We expect to continue to incur operating losses and that we will need to opportunistically raise additional capital to support the continued development and commercialization of the Aurora Driver. During the third quarter of 2024, we raised 483 million in equity capital from the 2024 Public Offering, receiving net proceeds of 466 million after transaction costs. During the third quarter of 2023, we raised 853 million in equity capital from a public offering and concurrent private placement, receiving net proceeds of 828 million after transaction costs. We expect our total liquidity will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for a period of at least twelve months from the date of this Quarterly Report. Management will continue to evaluate the timing and nature of discretionary operating expenses, as necessary. 
 Worldwide economic conditions remain uncertain, including inflation volatility. The general economic and capital market conditions both in the U.S. and worldwide, have been volatile in the past. The capital and credit markets may not be available to support future capital raising activity on favorable terms. If economic conditions decline, our future cost of equity or debt capital and access to the capital markets could be adversely affected. 
 Cash Flows 
 Cash flows for the periods were as follows (in millions): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash used in operating activities 
 (469) (465) Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities 
 (245) 332 Net cash provided by financing activities 
 475 827 Net (decrease) increase 
 (239) 694 Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash at beginning of the period 
 518 277 Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash at end of the period 
 279 971 
 Cash Flows Used in Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 469 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 4 million from 465 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to advanced payments for hardware materials for fleet builds partially offset by decreases in other operating expenditures. 
 Cash Flows (Used in) Provided by Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 245 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash provided by investing activities of 332 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change was primarily due to increased purchases and fewer maturities of short-term investments, as well as increased purchases of property and equipment for commercial fleet builds. 
 Cash Flows Provided by Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 475 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 352 million from 827 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower net proceeds received from the 2024 Public Offering compared to the 2023 Public Offering and Private Placement.

 Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies 
 Aurora may be party to various claims within the normal course of business. Legal fees and other costs associated with such actions are expensed as incurred. We assess the need to record a liability for litigation and other loss contingencies, with reserve estimates recorded if we determine that a loss related to the matter is both probable and reasonably estimable. No material losses were recorded in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. Preparation of the financial statements requires our management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amount of revenue and expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We consider an accounting judgment, estimate or assumption to be critical when (1) the estimate or assumption is complex in nature or requires a high degree of judgment and (2) the use of different judgments, estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year-ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates since our Annual Report. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in interest rates, and inflation, as well as risks to the availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our results of operations are directly exposed to changes in interest rates, among other macroeconomic conditions. Interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations, and other factors beyond our control. 
 We do not believe that an increase or decrease in interest rates of 100-basis points would have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Inflation Risk 
 We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, other than its impact on the general economy. Nonetheless, if our costs were to become subject to inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Our management evaluated, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer (our Certifying Officers ), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 Part II - Other Information 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are from time to time subject to various claims, lawsuits and other legal and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. However, we do not consider any such claims, lawsuits or proceedings that are currently pending, individually or in the aggregate, to be material to our business or likely or result in a material adverse effect on our future operating results, financial condition or cash flows. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our stock. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 None. 
 
 Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities 
 Not applicable. 
 
 Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures 
 Not applicable. 
 
 Item 5. Other Information
