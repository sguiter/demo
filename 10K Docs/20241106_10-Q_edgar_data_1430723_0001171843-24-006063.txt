At September 30, 2024 and 2023, no allowance for credit losses ACL has been recognized on available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position as the Company does not believe any of the debt securities are credit impaired. This is based on the Company s analysis of the risk characteristics, including credit ratings, and other qualitative factors related to available-for-sale debt securities. The issuers of these debt securities continue to make timely principal and interest payments under the contractual terms of the securities. The Company does not intend to sell these debt securities and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the debt securities before recovery of their amortized cost, which may be at maturity. The unrealized losses are due to increases in market interest rates over the yields available at the time the debt securities were purchased. Management measures expected credit losses on held-to-maturity securities on a collective basis by major security type with each type sharing similar risk characteristics and considers historical credit loss information that is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. With regard to U.S. Treasury and residential mortgage-backed securities issued by the U.S. government, or agencies thereof, it is expected that the securities will not be settled at prices less than the amortized cost bases of the securities as such securities are backed by the full faith and credit of and/or guaranteed by the U.S. government. Accordingly, no allowance for credit losses has been recorded for these securities. With regard to securities issued by States and political subdivisions and other held-to-maturity securities, management considers (i) issuer bond ratings, (ii) historical loss rates for given bond ratings, (iii) whether issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments under the contractual terms of the securities, and (iv) internal forecasts. Historical loss rates associated with securities having similar grades as those in our portfolio have generally not been significant. Furthermore, as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were no past due principal or interest payments associated with these securities. Based upon (i) the issuer s strong bond ratings and (ii) a zero historical loss rate, no allowance for credit losses has been recorded for held-to-maturity State and Municipal Securities as such amount is not material at September 30, 2024 and 2023. All debt securities in an unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024 continue to perform as scheduled and the Company does not believe there is a possible credit loss or that an allowance for credit loss on these debt securities is necessary. 

Commercial, financial and agricultural - Includes loans to business enterprises issued for commercial, industrial, agricultural production and/or other professional purposes. These loans are generally secured by equipment, inventory, and accounts receivable of the borrower and repayment is primarily dependent on business cash flows. 

Real estate construction Includes loans secured by real estate to finance land development or the construction of industrial, commercial or residential buildings. Repayment is dependent upon the completion and eventual sale, refinance or operation of the related real estate project. 

Owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage Includes loans secured by nonfarm nonresidential properties for which the primary source of repayment is the cash flow from the ongoing operations conducted by the party that owns the property. 

1-4 family real estate mortgage Includes loans secured by residential properties, including home equity lines of credit. Repayment is primarily dependent on the personal cash flow of the borrower. 

Other real estate mortgage Includes loans secured by nonowner-occupied properties, including office buildings, industrial buildings, warehouses, retail buildings, multifamily residential properties and farmland. Repayment is primarily dependent on income generated from the underlying collateral. 

Consumer Includes loans to individuals not secured by real estate. Repayment is dependent upon the personal cash flow of the borrower.

The credit quality of the loan portfolio is summarized no less frequently than quarterly using categories similar to the standard asset classification system used by the federal banking agencies. The following table presents credit quality indicators for the credit loss portfolio segments and classes. These categories are utilized to develop the associated allowance for credit losses using historical losses adjusted for current economic conditions defined as follows: 

Pass loans which are well protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor (or obligors, if any) or by the fair value, less cost to acquire and sell, of any underlying collateral. 

Special Mention loans with potential weakness that may, if not reversed or corrected, weaken the credit or inadequately protect the Company s position at some future date. These loans are not adversely classified and do not expose an institution to sufficient risk to warrant an adverse classification. 

Substandard loans that exhibit well-defined weakness or weaknesses that presently jeopardize debt repayment. These loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the weaknesses are not corrected. 

Doubtful loans that have all the weaknesses inherent in loans classified substandard, plus the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values highly questionable and improbable.

Under the current expected credit losses CECL methodology, the ACL is measured on a collective basis for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics. For loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with the collectively evaluated pools, evaluations are performed on an individual basis. For all loan segments collectively evaluated, losses are predicted over a period of time determined to be reasonable and supportable, and at the end of the reasonable and supportable forecast period losses are reverted to long-term historical averages. The estimated loan losses for all loan segments are adjusted for changes in qualitative factors not inherently considered in the quantitative analyses. 

The Company uses the discounted cash flow DCF method to estimate ACL for all loan pools except for commercial and industrial ("C I") revolving lines of credit and credit cards. C I revolving lines of credit and credit cards are members of the Commercial, financial and agricultural and Consumer portfolios, respectively. For all loan pools utilizing the DCF method, the Company utilizes and forecasts national unemployment rate as a loss driver. The Company also utilizes and forecasts GDP growth as a second loss driver for its agricultural and consumer loan pools. Consistent forecasts of the loss drivers are used across the loan segments. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company utilized a reasonable and supportable forecast period of twelve months followed by a six-month straight-line reversion to long term averages. The Company leveraged economic projections from reputable and independent sources to inform its loss driver forecasts. The Company expects the national unemployment rate to fall and the national GDP growth rate to rise compared to the December 31, 2023 forecast. 

The Company uses a loss-rate method to estimate expected credit losses for its C I revolving lines of credit and credit card pools. The C I revolving lines of credit pool incorporates a probability of default PD and loss given default LGD modeling approach. This approach involves estimating the pool average life and then using historical correlations of default and loss experience over time to calculate the lifetime PD and LGD. These two inputs are then applied to the outstanding pool balance. The credit card pool incorporates a remaining life modeling approach, which utilizes an attrition-based method to estimate the remaining life of the pool. A quarterly average loss rate is then calculated using the Company s historical loss data. The model reduces the pool balance quarterly on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the pool. The quarterly loss rate is multiplied by the outstanding balance at each period-end resulting in an estimated loss for each quarter. The sum of estimated loss for all quarters is the total calculated reserve for the pool. Management has applied the loss-rate method to C I lines of credit and to credit cards due to their generally short-term nature. An expected loss ratio is applied based on internal and peer historical losses. 

Each loan pool is adjusted for qualitative factors not inherently considered in the quantitative analyses. The qualitative adjustments either increase or decrease the quantitative model estimation. The Company considers factors that are relevant within the qualitative framework which include the following: lending policy, changes in nature and volume of loans, staff experience, changes in volume and trends of problem loans, concentration risk, trends in underlying collateral values, external factors, quality of loan review system and other economic conditions. 

Inherent risks in the loan portfolio will differ based on type of loan. Specific risk characteristics by loan portfolio segment are listed below: 

Commercial, financial and agricultural loans include risks associated with the borrower s cash flow, debt service coverage, and management s expertise. These loans are subject to the risk that the Company may have difficulty converting collateral to a liquid asset if necessary, as well as risks associated with the degree of specialization, mobility, and general collectability in a default situation. These commercial loans may be subject to many different types of risks, including fraud, bankruptcy, economic downturn, deteriorated or non-existent collateral, and changes in interest rates. 

Real estate construction loans include risks associated with the borrower s creditworthiness, contractor s qualifications, borrower and contractor performance, and the overall risk and complexity of the proposed project. Construction lending is also subject to risks associated with sub-market dynamics, including population, employment trends and household income. During times of economic stress, this type of loan has typically had a greater degree of risk than other loan types. 

Real estate mortgage loans consist of loans secured by commercial and residential real estate. Commercial real estate lending is dependent upon successful management, marketing and expense supervision necessary to maintain the property. Repayment of these loans may be adversely affected by conditions in the real estate market or the general economy. Also, commercial real estate loans typically involve relatively large loan balances to a single borrower. Residential real estate lending risks are generally less significant than those of other loans. Real estate lending risks include fluctuations in the value of real estate, bankruptcies, economic downturn and customer financial problems. 

Consumer loans carry a moderate degree of risk compared to other loans. They are generally more risky than traditional residential real estate loans but less risky than commercial loans. Risk of default is usually determined by the well-being of the local economies. During times of economic stress, there is usually some level of job loss both nationally and locally, which directly affects the ability of the consumer to repay debt.

We maintain an ACL on unfunded lending commitments and letters of credit to provide for the risk of loss inherent in these arrangements. The allowance is computed using a methodology similar to that used to determine the ACL for loans, modified to take into account the probability of a drawdown on the commitment. The ACL on unfunded loan commitments is classified as a liability account on the Consolidated Balance Sheet within other liabilities, while the corresponding provision for these credit losses is recorded as a component of other expense. During the third quarter of 2024, we reclassified the provision for Unfunded Commitments from Other Expenses to Provision for Credit Losses. The ACL on unfunded commitments was million at September 30, 2023, and at December 31, 2023. The provision expense for unfunded commitments was and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. There was no provision expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 

Loans that no longer share similar risk characteristics with collectively evaluated pools are estimated on an individual basis. A loan is considered collateral-dependent when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral.

For purposes of this disclosure, default is defined as 90 days past due and still accruing or placement on nonaccrual status. Adjustments have been made to both the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2023 tables, due to the refinement of our policy surrounding the definition of borrowers experiencing financial difficulty.

The Company s 2009 Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of up to shares and allows for the issuance of Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock, Stock Options, Non-stock Share Equivalents, Performance Shares or Performance Units. The plan allows for the grant of incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options, and option awards are granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Company s common stock at the date of grant. The maximum term of the options granted under the plan is ten years. 

The Company estimates the fair value of each stock option award using a Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. Expected volatilities are based on the Company s trading price history. The expected term for options granted is based on the short-cut method and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. 

There have not been any grants of stock options since October of 2019.

Restricted Stock and Performance Shares 

The Company periodically grants restricted stock awards that vest upon time-based service conditions. Dividend payments are made during the vesting period. The value of restricted stock is determined to be the current value of the Company s stock, and this total value will be recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period. As of September 30, 2024, there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested time-based restricted stock. The cost is expected to be recognized evenly over the remaining years of the restricted stock s vesting period. 

The Company periodically grants performance shares that give plan participants the opportunity to earn between and of the number of performance shares granted based on achieving certain market conditions. The number of performance shares earned is determined by reference to the Company s total shareholder return relative to a peer group of other publicly traded banks and bank holding companies during the performance period. The performance period is generally three years starting on the grant date. The fair value of the performance shares is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model on the grant date. As of September 30, 2024, there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested performance shares. As of September 30, 2024, non-vested performance shares had a weighted average remaining time to vest of years.

Debt Securities. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the hierarchy. Level 1 securities include highly liquid government securities such as U.S. Treasuries and exchange-traded equity securities. For securities traded in secondary markets for which quoted market prices are not available, the Company generally relies on pricing services provided by independent vendors. Such independent pricing services are to advise the Company on the carrying value of the securities available for sale portfolio. As part of the Company s procedures, the price provided from the service is evaluated for reasonableness given market changes. When a questionable price exists, the Company investigates further to determine if the price is valid. If needed, other market participants may be utilized to determine the correct fair value. The Company has also reviewed and confirmed its determinations in discussions with the pricing service regarding their methods of price discovery. Securities measured with these techniques are classified within Level 2 of the hierarchy and often involve using quoted market prices for similar securities, pricing models or discounted cash flow calculations using inputs observable in the market where available. Examples include U.S. government agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, obligations of states and political subdivisions, and certain corporate, asset-backed and other securities. In cases where Level 1 or Level 2 inputs are not available, as in the case of certain corporate securities, these securities are classified in Level 3 of the hierarchy. 

Derivative instruments. The fair values of derivatives are determined based on a valuation pricing model using readily available observable market parameters such as interest rate curves, adjusted for counterparty credit risk. These measurements are classified as level 2 within the valuation hierarchy. 

Loans Individually Evaluated. Loans individually evaluated are measured and reported at fair value when full payment under the loan terms is not probable. Loans individually evaluated are carried at the present value of expected future cash flows using a discounted cash flow calculation, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral-dependent. Expected cash flows are based on internal inputs reflecting expected default rates on contractual cash flows. This method of estimating fair value does not incorporate the exit-price concept of fair value described in ASC 820-10 and would generally result in a higher value than the exit-price approach. For loans measured using the estimated fair value of collateral less costs to sell, fair value is generally determined based on appraisals performed by certified and licensed appraisers using inputs such as absorption rates, capitalization rates and market comparables, adjusted for estimated costs to sell. Management modifies the appraised values, if needed, to take into account recent developments in the market or other factors, such as changes in absorption rates or market conditions from the time of valuation, and anticipated sales values considering management s plans for disposition. Such modifications to the appraised values could result in lower valuations of such collateral. Estimated costs to sell are based on current amounts of disposal costs for similar assets. These measurements are classified as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy. Loans individually evaluated are subject to nonrecurring fair value adjustment upon initial recognition or subsequent individual evaluation. A portion of the ACL is allocated to loans individually evaluated if the value of such loans is deemed to be less than the unpaid balance. The range of fair value adjustments and weighted average adjustment as of September 30, 2024 was to and , respectively. The range of fair value adjustments and weighted average adjustment as of December 31, 2023 was to and respectively. Loans individually evaluated are reviewed and evaluated on at least a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly based on the same factors identified above. The amount recognized to write-down individually evaluated loans that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis was million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 

Other Real Estate Owned . Other real estate assets OREO acquired through, or in lieu of, foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at the lower of cost or fair value, less selling costs. Any write-downs to fair value at the time of transfer to OREO are charged to the ACL subsequent to foreclosure. Values are derived from appraisals of underlying collateral and discounted cash flow analysis. Appraisals are performed by certified and licensed appraisers. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are updated periodically and assets are marked to current fair value, not to exceed the new cost basis. In the determination of fair value subsequent to foreclosure, management also considers other factors or recent developments, such as changes in absorption rates and market conditions from the time of valuation, and anticipated sales values considering management s plans for disposition, which could result in adjustment to lower the property value estimates indicated in the appraisals. The range of fair value adjustments and weighted average adjustment as of September 30, 2024 was to and , respectively. The range of fair value adjustments and weighted average adjustment as of December 31, 2023 was to and , respectively. These measurements are classified as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy. A loss on the sale and write-downs of OREO and repossessed assets of and was recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. These charges were for write-downs in the value of OREO subsequent to foreclosure and losses on the disposal of OREO. OREO is classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy. 

There were five residential real estate loans with a balance of foreclosed and classified as OREO as of September 30, 2024, compared to three residential real estate loan foreclosures for as of December 31, 2023. 

Three residential real estate loans totaling were in the process of being foreclosed as of September 30, 2024. There were three residential real estate loans for that were in the process of being foreclosed as of December 31, 2023.

In the case of the debt securities portfolio, the Company monitors the portfolio to ascertain when transfers between levels have been affected. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were two transfers out of Level 3 into Level 2. 

The table below includes a roll forward of the balance sheet amounts for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 (including the change in fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Company within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy measured at fair value on a recurring basis including changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology:

Fair value, end of period 

The fair value of a financial instrument is the current amount that would be exchanged in a sale between willing parties, other than in a forced liquidation. Fair value is best determined based upon quoted market prices. However, in many instances, there are no quoted market prices for the Company s various financial instruments. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. Accordingly, the fair value estimates may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the instrument. Current U.S. GAAP excludes certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments from its fair value disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented may not necessarily represent the underlying fair value of the Company. 

The estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments not measured at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows:

Investment Securities 

Debt securities available-for-sale totaled 1.14 billion at September 30, 2024 and 900.2 million at December 31, 2023. Investment securities held to maturity totaled 728.6 million at September 30, 2024 and 982.7 million at December 31, 2023. We had paydowns of 72.8 million on mortgage-backed securities and government agencies, maturities of 667.7 million on municipal bonds, corporate securities and treasury securities, and calls of 2.0 million on corporate securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We purchased 95.3 million in mortgage-backed securities, and 591.5 million in U.S. Treasury securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For a tabular presentation of debt securities available for sale and held to maturity at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, see Note 4 Securities in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The objective of our investment policy is to invest funds not otherwise needed to meet our loan demand to earn the maximum return, yet still maintain sufficient liquidity to meet fluctuations in our loan demand and deposit structure. In doing so, we balance the market and credit risks against the potential investment return, make investments compatible with the pledge requirements of any deposits of public funds, maintain compliance with regulatory investment requirements, and assist certain public entities with their financial needs. The investment committee has full authority over the investment portfolio and makes decisions on purchases and sales of securities. The entire portfolio, along with all investment transactions occurring since the previous board of directors meeting, is reviewed by the board at each monthly meeting. The investment policy allows portfolio holdings to include short-term securities purchased to provide us with needed liquidity and longer-term securities purchased to generate level income for us over periods of interest rate fluctuations.

All investment securities in an unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024 continue to perform as scheduled. We have evaluated the securities and have determined that the decline in fair value, relative to its amortized cost, is not due to credit-related factors. In addition, we have the ability to hold these securities within the portfolio until maturity or until the value recovers, and we believe that it is not likely that we will be required to sell these securities prior to recovery. We continue to monitor all of our securities with a high degree of scrutiny. There can be no assurance that we will not conclude in future periods that conditions existing at that time indicate some or all of its securities may be sold or would require a charge to earnings as a provision for credit losses in such periods. 

The Company does not invest in collateralized debt obligations CDOs ). As of September 30, 2024, we had 323.6 million of bank holding company subordinated notes. If rated, all such bonds were rated BBB or better by Kroll Bond Rating Agency at the time of our initial investment. All other corporate bonds had a Standard and Poor s or Moody s rating of A-1 or better when purchased. The total investment portfolio has a combined average credit rating of AA as of September 30, 2024. 

The carrying value of investment securities pledged to secure public funds on deposit and for other purposes as required by law was 1.52 billion and 1.49 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

We had total loans of 12.34 billion, an increase of 679.4 million, or 5.8 , from 11.66 billion at December 31, 2023. Other mortgage increased 424.8 million from last year, and increased 118.9 million during the quarter, making up over half of total loan growth for both periods. Our loan pipeline has expanded and indicates that loan demand is improving in our market areas. 

Asset Quality 

The Company assesses the adequacy of its allowance for credit losses ("ACL") at the end of each calendar quarter. The level of ACL is based on the Company s evaluation of historical default and loss experience, current and projected economic conditions, asset quality trends, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrowers ability to repay a loan, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio and other relevant factors. The ACL is increased by a provision for credit losses, which is charged to expense, and reduced by charge-offs, net of recoveries. The ACL is believed adequate to absorb all expected future losses to be recognized over the contractual life of the loans in the portfolio. 

Loans with similar risk characteristics are evaluated in pools and, depending on the nature of each identified pool, the Company utilizes a discounted cash flow DCF ), probability of default / loss given default PD/LGD or remaining life method. The historical loss experience estimate by pool is then adjusted by forecast factors that are quantitatively related to the Company s historical credit loss experience, such as national unemployment rates and gross domestic product. Losses are predicted over a period of time determined to be reasonable and supportable, and at the end of the reasonable and supportable period losses are reverted to long term historical averages. The reasonable and supportable period and reversion period are re-evaluated each quarter by the Company and are dependent on the current economic environment among other factors. See Note 1 General and Note 5 Loans in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this report. 

The expected credit losses for each loan pool are then adjusted for changes in qualitative factors not inherently considered in the quantitative analyses. The qualitative adjustments either increase or decrease the quantitative model estimation. The Company considers factors that are relevant within the qualitative framework which include the following: lending policy, changes in nature and volume of loans, staff experience, changes in volume and trends of problem loans, concentration risk, trends in underlying collateral values, external factors, quality of loan review system and other economic conditions. 

Expected credit losses for loans that no longer share similar risk characteristics with the collectively evaluated pools are excluded from the collective evaluation and estimated on an individual basis. Individual evaluations are performed for nonaccrual loans, loans rated substandard, and certain modified loans. Specific allocations of the ACL are estimated on one of several methods, including the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, observable market value of similar debt or the present value of expected cash flows.

Nonperforming Assets 

Total nonperforming loans at September 30, 2024, which include nonaccrual loans and loans 90 or more days past due and still accruing, increased 17.6 million, or 81.9 , to 39.2 million from 21.5 million at December 31, 2023. Of this total, nonaccrual loans of 37.1 million at September 30, 2024 represented a net increase of 17.7 million from nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2023. The increase in non-performing assets to total assets can primarily be attributed to a single relationship that moved to non-accrual status during the first quarter of 2024. Excluding credit card accounts, there were seven loans 90 or more days past due and still accruing totaling 951,000 at September 30, 2024, compared to nine loans totaling 1.9 million at December 31, 2023. Loans made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that were modified during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 56.1 million and 25.9 million, respectively.

The balance of nonperforming assets can fluctuate due to changes in economic conditions. We have established a policy to discontinue accruing interest on a loan (i.e., place the loan on nonaccrual status) after it has become 90 days delinquent as to payment of principal or interest, unless the loan is considered to be well-collateralized and is actively in the process of collection. In addition, a loan will be placed on nonaccrual status before it becomes 90 days delinquent unless management believes that the collection of interest is expected. Interest previously accrued but uncollected on such loans is reversed and charged against current income when the receivable is determined to be uncollectible. Interest income on nonaccrual loans is recognized only as received. If we believe that a loan will not be collected in full, we will increase the ACL to reflect management s estimate of any potential exposure or loss. Generally, payments received on nonaccrual loans are applied directly to principal. 

31

Deposits 

We rely on increasing our deposit base to fund loan and other asset growth. Each of our markets is highly competitive. We compete for local deposits by offering attractive products with competitive rates. We expect to have a higher average cost of funds for local deposits than competitor banks due to our lack of an extensive branch network. Our management s strategy is to offset the higher cost of funding with a lower level of operating expense and firm pricing discipline for loan products. We have promoted electronic banking services by providing them without charge and by offering in-bank customer training. At September 30, 2024, our total deposits were 13.15 billion, a decrease of 127.0 million, or 1.0 , from 13.27 billion at December 31, 2023. 

The following table summarizes balances of our deposits and the percentage of each type to the total at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we estimate that we had approximately 8.74 billion and 8.76 billion, respectively, in uninsured deposits, which are the portion of deposit accounts that exceed the FDIC insurance limit. The uninsured deposit data for 2024 and 2023 reflect the deposit insurance impact of combined ownership segregation of escrow and other accounts at an aggregate level but do not reflect an evaluation of all of the account styling distinctions that would determine the availability of deposit insurance to individual accounts based on FDIC regulations. 

Other Borrowings 

Our borrowings consist of federal funds purchased and subordinated notes payable. We had 1.54 billion and 1.26 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, in federal funds purchased from correspondent banks that are clients of our correspondent banking unit. The average rate paid on these borrowings was 4.97 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Other borrowings consist of the following: 

30.0 million of the Company s 4.5 Subordinated Notes due November 8, 2027, which were issued in a private placement in November 2017 and pay interest semi-annually. The Notes may be prepaid by the Company; and 

34.75 million of the Company s 4 Subordinated Notes due October 21, 2030, which were issued in a private placement in October 2020 and pay interest semi-annually. The Notes may not be prepaid by the Company prior to October 21, 2025. 

Liquidity 

Liquidity is defined as our ability to generate sufficient cash to fund current loan demand, deposit withdrawals, and other cash demands and disbursement needs, and otherwise to operate on an ongoing basis. 

The retention of existing deposits and attraction of new deposit sources through new and existing customers is critical to our liquidity position. If our liquidity was to decline due to deposit withdrawals, we have procedures that provide for certain actions under varying liquidity conditions. These actions include borrowing from existing correspondent banks, selling or participating loans, and curtailing loan commitments and funding. At September 30, 2024, our liquid assets, represented by cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and unpledged available-for-sale securities, totaled 2.11 billion. The Bank had loans pledged to both the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, which provided approximately 2.93 billion and 2.15 billion, respectively, in available funding. The Bank s policy limits on brokered deposits would allow for up to 4.11 billion in available funding for brokered deposits. Additionally, the Bank had approximately 225.0 million in available unused federal funds lines of credit with regional banks, subject to certain restrictions and collateral requirements, to meet short term funding needs. 

Our management meets on a quarterly basis to review sources and uses of funding to determine the appropriate strategy to ensure an appropriate level of liquidity. At the current time, our long-term liquidity needs primarily relate to funds required to support loan originations and commitments and deposit withdrawals. Our regular sources of funding are from the growth of our deposit base, repayment of principal and interest on loans, the sale of loans and the renewal of time deposits. In addition, we have issued debt as described above under Borrowings and have various other sources of liquidity as discussed herein. We believe these sources of funding are adequate to meet both our immediate (within the next 12 months) and our longer term anticipated funding needs. However, we may need additional funding if we are successful in maintaining our current growth rate into the future. 

32

We are subject to general FDIC guidelines that require a minimum level of liquidity. Management believes our liquidity ratios meet or exceed these guidelines. 

The following table illustrates, during the periods presented, the mix of our funding sources and the assets in which those funds are invested as a percentage of our average total assets for the period indicated. Average assets totaled 16.63 billion and 16.10 billion, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Capital Adequacy 

Total stockholders equity attributable to us at September 30, 2024 was 1.57 billion, or 9.55 of total assets. At December 31, 2023, total stockholders equity attributable to us was 1.44 billion, or 8.93 of total assets. 

As of September 30, 2024, our most recent notification from the FDIC categorized us as well-capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To remain categorized as well-capitalized, we must maintain minimum Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 risk-based, total risk-based, and Tier 1 leverage ratios as disclosed in the table below. Our management believes that we are well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action provisions as of September 30, 2024. 

The following table sets forth (i) the capital ratios required by the FDIC and the Alabama Banking Department s leverage ratio requirement and (ii) our actual ratios, not including the applicable 2.5 capital conservation buffer, of capital to total regulatory or risk-weighted assets, as of September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023:

We are a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. Our principal source of cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends to our stockholders, are dividends the Bank pays to us as the Bank s sole stockholder. Statutory and regulatory limitations apply to the Bank s payment of dividends to us as well to our payment of dividends to our stockholders. The requirement that a bank holding company must serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks also results in the position of the Federal Reserve that a bank holding company should not maintain a level of cash dividends to its stockholders that places undue pressure on the capital of its bank subsidiaries or that can be funded only through additional borrowings or other arrangements that may undermine the bank holding company s ability to serve as a source of strength. Our ability to pay dividends is also subject to the provisions of Delaware corporate law. 

The Alabama Banking Department also regulates the Bank s dividend payments. Under Alabama law, a state-chartered bank may not pay a dividend in excess of 90 of its net earnings until the Bank s surplus is equal to at least 20 of its capital (our Bank s surplus currently exceeds 20 of its capital). Moreover, our Bank is also required by Alabama law to obtain the prior approval of the Superintendent of Banks Superintendent for its payment of dividends if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank in any calendar year will exceed the total of (i) the Bank s net earnings (as defined by statute) for that year, plus (ii) its retained net earnings for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to surplus. In addition, no dividends, withdrawals or transfers may be made from the Bank s surplus without the prior written approval of the Superintendent. 

The Bank s payment of dividends may also be affected or limited by other factors, such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, a depository institution may not pay any dividends if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized. Moreover, the federal agencies have issued policy statements that provide that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. If, in the opinion of the federal banking regulators, the Bank were engaged in or about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice, the federal banking regulators could require, after notice and a hearing, that the Bank stop or refrain from engaging in the questioned practice.

Commitments and Contingencies 

In the normal course of business, we are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit beyond current fundings, credit card arrangements, standby letters of credit, and financial guarantees. Those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in our balance sheet. The contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement we have in those particular financial arrangements. All such credit arrangements bear interest at variable rates and we have no such credit arrangements that bear interest at fixed rates. 

Our exposure to credit loss for commitments to extend credit, credit card arrangements and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual or notional amount of these instruments in the event of non-performance by the other party to such financial instrument. We use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on-balance sheet instruments. 

As part of our mortgage operations, we originate and sell certain loans to investors in the secondary market. We continue to experience a manageable level of investor repurchase demands. For loans sold, we have an obligation to either repurchase the outstanding principal balance of a loan or make the purchaser whole for the economic benefits of a loan if it is determined that the loans sold were in violation of representations and warranties made by the Bank at the time of the sale. Representations and warranties typically include those made regarding loans that had missing or insufficient file documentation or loans obtained through fraud by borrowers or other third parties such as appraisers. 

Financial instruments whose unfunded contract amounts represent credit risk at September 30, 2024 are as follows:

4,168,660 

Commitments to extend credit beyond current funded amounts are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the applicable loan agreement. Such commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We evaluate each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained if deemed necessary by us upon extension of credit is based on our management s credit evaluation. Collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment and income-producing commercial properties. 

Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing, and similar transactions. All letters of credit are due within one year or less of the original commitment date. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. 

Federal funds lines of credit are uncommitted lines issued to downstream correspondent banks for the purpose of providing liquidity to them. The lines are unsecured, and we have no obligation to sell federal funds to the correspondent, nor does the correspondent have any obligation to request or accept purchases of federal funds from us.

Summary of Net Income 

Net income and net income available to common stockholders was 59.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income and net income available to common stockholders was 53.3 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily attributable to increases in net interest income. Net income was 162.1 million and net income available to common stockholders was 162.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income was 164.8 million and net income available to common stockholders was 164.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily attributable increases in non-interest expenses and provision for income taxes that were partially offset by the growth in net interest income.

Return on average common stockholders equity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 15.55 and 14.51 , respectively, compared to 15.34 and 16.23 , respectively, for the corresponding periods in 2023. 

Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin Analysis 

Net interest income is the difference between the income earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities used to support such assets. The major factors which affect net interest income are changes in volumes, the yield on interest-earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Our management s ability to respond to changes in interest rates by effective asset-liability management techniques is critical to maintaining the stability of the net interest margin and the momentum of our primary source of earnings. 

Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased 15.4 million, or 15.5 , to 115.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 99.7 million for the corresponding period in 2023, and increased 14.8 million, or 4.8 , to 324.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 309.4 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The taxable-equivalent yield on interest-earning assets increased to 6.12 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.65 for the corresponding period in 2023, and increased to 6.00 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.48 for the corresponding period in 2023. The yield on loans for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 6.62 compared to 6.13 for the corresponding period in 2023, and 6.50 compared to 5.92 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The cost of total interest-bearing liabilities increased to 4.26 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 4.02 for the corresponding period in 2023, and increased to 4.23 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.54 for the corresponding period in 2023. Net interest margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.84 compared to 2.64 for the corresponding period in 2023, and 2.77 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.90 for the corresponding period in 2023. 

The Federal Reserve Bank decreased their targeted federal funds rate from 5.25 5.50 at September 30, 2023 to its current range as of September 30, 2024 of 4.75 5.00 . 

The following tables show, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the average balances of each principal category of our assets, liabilities and stockholders equity, and an analysis of net interest revenue. The accompanying tables reflect changes in our net interest margin as a result of changes in the volume and rate of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the same periods. Changes as a result of mix or the number of days in the periods have been allocated to the volume and rate changes in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each. The tables are presented on a taxable-equivalent basis where applicable:

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses on loans was 5.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 1.2 million from 4.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and was 15.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 23,000 from 15.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The ACL as of September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, totaled 160.8 million, 158.1 million, and 152.2 million, or 1.30 , 1.28 , and 1.31 of loans, net of unearned income, respectively. During the third quarter of 2024, we recorded a 2.7 million provision for the potential impact of Hurricane Helene, which struck the Florida coast on September 26, 2024, and caused widespread damage from Florida to the Carolinas. In early October, Hurricane Milton struck the west coast of Florida and tracked across the middle of the state. Management is assessing the impact of both hurricanes to determine if additional provisions are warranted. During the third quarter of 2024, we reclassified the provision for Unfunded Commitments from Other Expenses to Provision for Credit Losses. Annualized net credit charge-offs to quarter-to-date average loans were 0.09 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a 6 basis points decrease compared to 0.15 for the third quarter of 2023. Annualized net credit charge-offs to year-to-date average loans were 0.13 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.16 for the corresponding period in 2023. Nonperforming loans increased to 39.2 million, or 0.32 of total loans, at September 30, 2024 from 34.9 million, or 0.28 of total loans at December 31, 2023, and increased compared to 22.6 million, or 0.19 of total loans, at September 30, 2023. See the section captioned Asset Quality located elsewhere in this item for additional discussion related to provision for credit losses.

Noninterest income totaled 8.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 414,000, or 5.1 , compared to the corresponding period in 2023, and totaled 26.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 3.2 million, or 14.0 , from to the corresponding period in 2023. Service charges on deposit accounts increased 178,000, or 8.2 , to 2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.2 million for the same period in 2023, and increased 545,000, or 8.7 , to 6.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 6.2 million for the same period in 2023. Mortgage banking income increased 527,000, or 63.9 , to 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 825,000 for the same period in 2023, and increased 1.4 million, or 73.7 , to 3.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.0 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in mortgage banking revenue was primarily attributed to a combination of favorable market conditions and increased staffing levels. Net credit card income decreased 607,000, or 24.0 , to 1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.5 million for the same period in 2023, and decreased 214,000, or 3.2 , to 6.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 6.6 million for the same period in 2023. Bank-owned life insurance BOLI income increased 295,000, or 16.2 , to 2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.8 million for the same period in 2023, and increased 1.5 million, or 24.7 , to 7.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.9 million for the same period in 2023. We recognized 1.2 million of income attributed to a death benefit related to a former employee in our BOLI program during the first quarter of 2024, and 890,000 during the second quarter of 2023. Other income increased 21,000, or 2.6 , to 818,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 797,000 for the same period in 2023, and decreased 29,000, or 1.3 , to 2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.3 million for the same period in 2023. Merchant service revenue increased 12,000, or 2.0 , to 606,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 594,000 for the same period in 2023, and increased 79,000, or 4.9 , to 1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.6 million for the same period in 2023.

Noninterest expense totaled 45.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 4.0 million, or 9.5 , compared to the corresponding period in 2023, and totaled 134.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 14.5 million, or 12.1 , from to the corresponding period in 2023. During the second quarter of 2024, the Company recorded the impact from election of the proportional amortization method to account for historical and new market tax credit investments pursuant to adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2023-02. The proportional amortization method results in the cost of the investment being amortized in proportion to the income tax credits and other income tax benefits received, with the amortization of the investment and the income tax credits being presented net in the consolidated income statement as a component of income tax expense. Previously the amortization of the investment was included in other non-interest expenses. 

Details of expense are as follows: 

Salary and benefit expense increased 5.0 million, or 24.8 , to 25.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 20.1 million for the same period in 2023, and increased 14.3 million, or 24.7 , to 72.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 57.9 million for the same period in 2023. The number of FTE employees increased by 52, or 9.2 , to 620 at September 30, 2024 compared to 568 at September 30, 2023. The increase in salary and benefit expense year-over-year was largely due to the normalization of incentives and increased salary expenses due to an increase in FTE employees. Incentives increased approximately 1.8 million, and salaries increased approximately 2.1 million from the third quarter of 2023. 

41

Equipment and occupancy expense increased 216,000, or 6.0 , to 3.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.6 million for the same period in 2023, and increased 484,000, or 4.6 , to 10.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 10.4 million for the same period in 2023. 

Third party processing and other services increased 1.5 million, or 22.7 , to 8.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 6.5 million for the same period in 2023, and increased 2.6 million, or 13.2 , to 22.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 20.0 million for the same period in 2023. 

Professional services expense increased 450,000, or 35.6 , to 1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.3 million for the same period in 2023, and increased 421,000, or 9.4 , to 4.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 4.5 million for the same period in 2023. 

FDIC and other regulatory assessments increased 9,000, or .4 , to 2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.3 million for the same period in 2023, and increased 2.4 million, or 38.6 , to 8.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 6.1 million for the same period in 2023. In the first quarter of 2024, the FDIC implemented a special assessment adjustment to recapitalize the Deposit Insurance Fund resulting in an expense of 1.8 million. 

Other operating expenses decreased 3.3 million, or 41.6 , to 4.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 7.8 million for the same period in 2023, and decreased 5.9 million, or 28.3 , to 14.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 20.8 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease in other operating expenses were largely due to the application of the proportional amortization method to account for historical and new market tax credit investments, discussed above. 

Income Tax Expense 

Income tax expense was 12.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 8.5 million for the same period in 2023, and was 37.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 32.6 million for the same period in 2023. Our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 17.23 and 18.8 , respectively, compared to 13.81 and 16.51 for the corresponding periods in 2023, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rates reflect our adoption of the proportional amortization of accounting for investment tax credits during the first quarter of 2024. We recognized excess tax benefits as an income tax credit to our income tax expense from the exercise and vesting of stock options and restricted stock during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 111,000 and 711,000, respectively, compared to no expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Our primary permanent differences are related to tax exempt income on securities, state income tax benefit on real estate investment trust dividends, various qualifying tax credits and change in cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance. 

We own real estate investment trusts for the purpose of holding and managing participations in residential mortgages and commercial real estate loans originated by the Bank. The trusts are wholly-owned subsidiaries of a trust holding company, which in turn is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank. The trusts earn interest income on the loans they hold and incur operating expenses related to their activities. They pay their net earnings, in the form of dividends, to the Bank, which receives a deduction for state income taxes. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The accounting and financial policies of the Company conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and to general practices within the banking industry. To prepare consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. (GAAP), management makes estimates and assumptions based on available information. These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the disclosures provided, and future results could differ. In management s opinion, certain accounting policies have a more significant impact than others on the Company s financial reporting. The allowance for credit losses and income taxes are particularly significant for the Company s financial reporting. Information concerning our accounting policies and critical accounting estimates with respect to these items is available in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. There were no changes to the accounting policies for the allowance for credit losses or income taxes during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Like all financial institutions, we are subject to market risk from changes in interest rates. Interest rate risk is inherent in the balance sheet due to the mismatch between the maturities of rate-sensitive assets and rate-sensitive liabilities. If rates are rising, and the level of rate-sensitive liabilities exceeds the level of rate-sensitive assets, the net interest margin will be negatively impacted. Conversely, if rates are falling, and the level of rate-sensitive liabilities is greater than the level of rate-sensitive assets, the impact on the net interest margin will be favorable. Managing interest rate risk is further complicated by the fact that all rates do not change at the same pace; in other words, short-term rates may be rising while longer-term rates remain stable. In addition, different types of rate-sensitive assets and rate-sensitive liabilities react differently to changes in rates. 

42

To manage interest rate risk, we must take a position on the expected future trend of interest rates. Rates may rise, fall or remain the same. Our asset-liability committee develops its view of future rate trends and strives to manage rate risk within a targeted range by monitoring economic indicators, examining the views of economists and other experts, and understanding the current status of our balance sheet. Our annual budget reflects the anticipated rate environment for the next 12 months. The asset-liability committee conducts a quarterly analysis of the rate sensitivity position and reports its results to our board of directors. 

The asset-liability committee thoroughly analyzes the maturities of rate-sensitive assets and liabilities. This analysis measures the gap, which is defined as the difference between the dollar amount of rate-sensitive assets repricing during a period and the volume of rate-sensitive liabilities repricing during the same period. The gap is also expressed as the ratio of rate-sensitive assets divided by rate-sensitive liabilities. If the ratio is greater than one, the dollar value of assets exceeds the dollar value of liabilities; the balance sheet is asset-sensitive. Conversely, if the value of liabilities exceeds the value of assets, the ratio is less than one and the balance sheet is liability-sensitive. Our internal policy requires management to maintain the gap such that net interest margins will not change more than 10 if interest rates change 100 basis points or more than 15 if interest rates change 200 basis points. There have been no changes to our policies or procedures for analyzing our interest rate risk since December 31, 2023, and there have been no material changes to our sensitivity to changes in interest rates since December 31, 2023, as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. 

We conducted an evaluation (the "Evaluation") of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, as of September 30, 2024. Based upon the Evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From time to time, we may be a party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Management does not believe the Company or the Bank is currently a party to any material legal proceedings. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

Our business is influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual results and are often beyond our control. We have identified a number of these risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, which should be taken into consideration when reviewing the information contained in this report. There have been no material changes in the Company s risk factors from those disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

(ii) Employee acknowledges and understands that he waives his right to file suit for any claim Employee may have had under any and all laws and statutes including those mentioned in the paragraph above. While Employee understands that this Agreement does not prohibit him from filing an administrative charge with the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or any other government agency, Employee expressly waives his right to claim, receive, or accept any monies, damages or other individual relief awarded as a result of any charge of discrimination or lawsuit which may be filed by Employee or anyone acting of Employee s behalf. Employee understands this does not include government awards that may be given for providing information to a government agency, nor does it limit Employee s ability to communicate with any government agency or otherwise participate in any investigation or proceeding that may be conducted by any government agency, including providing documents or other information, without notice to Bank or Parent. Employee understands that by signing this Waiver, Employee is obtaining additional monies from Bank and Parent to which he would otherwise not be entitled. 

(e) Right of Revocation . This Agreement is intended to satisfy the requirements of the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, 29 U.S.C. sec 626(f). The following general provisions, along with the other provisions of this Agreement, are agreed to for this purpose: 

(i) It is understood and agreed that Employee has entered into and executed this Agreement voluntarily and that such execution by Employee is not based upon any representations or promises of any kind made by Bank, Parent or any of their representatives, except as expressly recited in this Agreement. 

(ii) Employee further acknowledges that he has read and fully understands each paragraph of this Agreement, that he was advised in writing by Bank and Parent to consult with an attorney prior to executing this Agreement, and that he has availed himself of legal or other counsel to the full extent that he desires. 

(iii) Employee also acknowledges that he was advised in writing by Bank and Parent that he could take up to twenty-one (21) days within which to consider and sign this Agreement and that he has considered this Agreement to the full extent that he desires. Finally, Employee agrees and acknowledges that the consideration provided under Section 2(b) is in addition to any other payments, benefits or other things of value to which he is entitled and that he would not be entitled to any of the consideration provided under Section 2(b) in the absence of his execution and acceptance of this Agreement. 

(iv) Employee shall have seven (7) days following his execution of this Agreement within which to exercise a right of revocation, and this Agreement will not be enforceable or effective until the expiration of such seven-day period. Any such revocation of this Agreement must be communicated in writing and delivered in person or by fax to Bank and Parent, as specified in Section 9(b), not later than close of business on the seventh day following Employee s execution of this Agreement. Otherwise, such revocation shall be of no force or effect.

Bank and Parent knowingly and voluntarily agree to waive, settle, release and discharge Employee from any and all claims, demands, damages, actions or causes of action, including any claim for attorneys fees, which Bank and Parent have against Employee arising out of or relating to Employee s employment with Bank and/or Parent. 

7. Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction. Any dispute regarding the reasonableness of the covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Alabama, and, with respect to each such dispute, Bank, Parent and Employee each hereby irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts sitting in Alabama for resolution of such dispute, and Bank, Parent and Employee agree to be irrevocably bound by any judgment rendered thereby in connection with such dispute. 

8. Injunctive Relief; Other Remedies. Employee acknowledges that a breach by Employee of Section 5 herein would cause immediate and irreparable harm to Bank and Parent for which an adequate monetary remedy does not exist; hence, Employee agrees that, in the event of a breach or threatened breach by Employee of the provisions of Section 5 herein, Bank and Parent shall be entitled to injunctive relief restraining Employee from such violation without the necessity of proof of actual damage or the posting of any bond, except as required by non-waivable, applicable law. Nothing herein, however, shall be construed as prohibiting Bank and Parent from pursuing any other remedy at law or in equity to which Bank or Parent may be entitled under applicable law in the event of a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by Employee. The Parties agree that the prevailing party in any dispute or litigation arising from this Release shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorney s fees, expert fees, and costs from the opposing party. In addition to the exercise of the foregoing remedies, Bank and Parent shall have the right upon the occurrence of any such breach or threatened breach to cancel any unpaid consideration, and/or to seek return of same provided for in Section 2(b) hereof. In particular, Employee acknowledges that the consideration provided in Section 2(b) hereof is conditioned upon Employee fulfilling all agreements contained in Sections 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of this Agreement. In addition, Employee acknowledges that the consideration provided for in Section 2(b) hereof is conditioned upon Employee not initiating or pursuing any claim against Bank or Parent that Employee has waived under Section 6 hereof. Employee acknowledges that any cancellation of consideration would be an exercise of Bank s and Parent s right to terminate its performance hereunder upon Employee s breach of this Agreement and that such cancellation of consideration would not constitute, and should not be characterized as, the imposition of liquidated damages, or a waiver of Employee s obligations as set forth in this Agreement. Employee shall be entitled to pursue any remedies at law or equity to enforce any provisions of this Agreement against Bank or Parent.
