 CAUTI ONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This report contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. You can identify these statements by the use of forward-looking terminology such as may, will, should, expect, anticipate, project, target, estimate, intend, continue or believe or the negatives of, or other variations on, these terms or comparable terminology. You should read statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss our plans, strategies, prospects and expectations concerning our business, operating results, financial condition and other similar matters. We believe that it is important to communicate our future expectations to our investors. Our forward-looking statements include information in this report regarding general domestic and global economic conditions, our future financing plans, our ability to operate as a business development company BDC and the expected performance of, and the yield on, our portfolio companies. There may be events in the future, however, that we are not able to predict accurately or control. The factors listed under Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as well as any cautionary language in this report, provide examples of risks, uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forward-looking statements. The occurrence of the events described in these risk factors and elsewhere in this report could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. Any forward-looking statement made by us in this report speaks only as of the date of this report. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. You are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to you or through reports that we have filed or in the future may file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), including annual reports on Form 10-K, registration statements on Form N-2, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. The safe harbor provisions of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), which preclude civil liability for certain forward-looking statements, do not apply to the forward-looking statements in this quarterly report because we are an investment company. The following factors are among those that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements: 
 our future operating results; 

disruptions in the capital markets, market conditions, and general economic uncertainty; 

changes in political, economic, social or industry conditions, the interest rate environment or conditions affecting the financial and capital markets, including the effect of any pandemic or epidemic;

Dividend income on preferred equity investments is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity investments is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies and on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. Interest and dividend income are presented net of withholding tax, if any. Certain investments may have contractual payment-in-kind PIK interest or dividends.

Due to Affiliates The Investment Adviser pays certain general and administrative expenses on behalf of the Company in the ordinary course of business. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were and included within Accrued expenses and other liabilities that were paid by the Investment Adviser and its affiliates on behalf of the Company. Co-Investment Activity In certain circumstances, the Company can make negotiated co-investments pursuant to an exemptive order from the SEC permitting it to do so. On November 16, 2022, the SEC granted to the Investment Adviser, the BDCs advised by the Investment Adviser and certain other affiliated applicants exemptive relief on which the Company expects to rely to co-invest alongside certain other client accounts managed by the Investment Adviser (collectively with the Company, the Accounts ), which may include proprietary accounts of Goldman Sachs, in a manner consistent with the Company s investment objectives and strategies, certain Board-established criteria, the conditions of such exemptive relief and other pertinent factors (as amended, the Relief ). On June 25, 2024, the SEC granted an amendment to the Relief, which permits the Company to participate in follow-on investments in the Company s existing portfolio companies with certain affiliates covered by the Relief if such affiliates, that are not BDCs or registered investment companies, have an investment in such existing portfolio company. Additionally, if the Investment Adviser forms other funds in the future, the Company may co-invest alongside such other affiliates, subject to compliance with the Relief, applicable regulations and regulatory guidance, as well as applicable allocation procedures. As a result of the Relief, there could be significant overlap in the Company s investment portfolio and the investment portfolios of other Accounts, including, in some cases, proprietary accounts of Goldman Sachs. The Goldman Sachs Asset Management Private Credit Team is composed of investment professionals dedicated to the Company s investment strategy and to other funds that share a similar investment strategy with the Company. The Goldman Sachs Asset Management Private Credit Team is responsible for identifying investment opportunities, conducting research and due diligence on prospective investments, negotiating and structuring the Company s investments and monitoring and servicing the Company s investments. The team works together with investment professionals who are primarily focused on investment strategies in syndicated, liquid credit. Under the terms of the Relief, a required majority (as defined in Section 57(o) of the Investment Company Act) of the Company s independent directors must make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the proposed transaction are reasonable and fair to the Company and the Company s Unitholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of the Company or its Unitholders on the part of any person concerned, and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of the Company s Unitholders and is consistent with the then-current investment objectives and strategies of the Company.

The income approach was used in the determination of fair value for or of Level 3 bank loans, corporate debt, and other debt obligations. 

 (3) The fair value of any one instrument may be determined using multiple valuation techniques. For example, market comparable and discounted cash flows may be used together to determine fair value. Therefore, the Level 3 balance encompasses both of these techniques. 

 (4) The range for an asset category consisting of a single investment, if any, is not meaningful and therefore has been excluded. 

 (5) Weighted average for an asset category consisting of multiple investments is calculated by weighting the significant unobservable input by the relative fair value of the investment. Weighted average for an asset category consisting of a single investment represents the significant unobservable input used in the fair value of the investment. 

 (6) Enterprise value of portfolio company as a multiple of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA ). 

As noted above, the income and market approaches were used in the determination of fair value of certain Level 3 assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The significant unobservable inputs used in the income approach are the discount rate or market yield used to discount the estimated future cash flows expected to be received from the underlying investment, which include both future principal and interest payments. An increase in the discount rate or market yield would result in a decrease in the fair value. Included in the consideration and selection of discount rates or market yields is risk of default, rating of the investment, call provisions and comparable company investments. The significant unobservable inputs used in the market approach are based on market comparable transactions and market multiples of publicly traded comparable companies. Increase in market comparable transactions or market multiples would result in an increase in the fair value.

 ITEM 2.	 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion and other parts of this report contain forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties. References to we, us, our, and the Company, mean Goldman Sachs Private Middle Market Credit II LLC or Goldman Sachs Private Middle Market Credit II LLC, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, as the context may require. The terms GSAM, Goldman Sachs Asset Management, our Adviser or our Investment Adviser refer to Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership. The term GS Group Inc. refers to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. GS Co. refers to Goldman Sachs Co. LLC and its predecessors. The term Goldman Sachs refers to GS Group Inc., together with GS Co., GSAM and its other subsidiaries and affiliates. The discussion and analysis contained in this section refer to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. Please see Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with this discussion and analysis. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by such forward-looking information due to factors discussed under Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements appearing elsewhere in this report. 
 OVERVIEW 
 We are a specialty finance company focused on lending to middle-market companies. We are a closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ). In addition, we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), and we expect to qualify annually for tax treatment as a RIC, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2019. From our commencement of investment operations on April 11, 2019 through September 30, 2024, we have originated approximately 4.45 billion in aggregate principal amount of debt and equity investments prior to any subsequent exits and repayments. We seek to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation primarily through direct originations of secured debt, including first lien, unitranche debt, including last-out portions of such loans, and second lien debt, and unsecured debt, including mezzanine debt, as well as through select equity investments. 
 Unitranche loans are first lien loans that extend deeper in a borrower s capital structure than traditional first lien debt and may provide for a waterfall of cash flow priority between different lenders in such loan. In a number of instances, we may find another lender to provide the first-out portion of a unitranche loan while we retain the last-out portion of such loan, in which case, the first-out portion of the loan would generally receive priority with respect to the payment of principal, interest and any other amounts due thereunder as compared to the last-out portion that we would continue to hold. In exchange for taking greater risk of loss, the last-out portion generally earns a higher interest rate than the first-out portion of the loan. We use the term mezzanine to refer to debt that ranks senior in right of payment only to a borrower s equity securities and ranks junior in right of payment to all of such borrower s other indebtedness. We may make multiple investments in the same portfolio company. 
 We expect to invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80 of our net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes), directly or indirectly in private middle-market credit obligations and related instruments. We define credit obligations and related instruments for this purpose as any fixed-income instrument, including loans to, and bonds and preferred stock of, portfolio companies and other instruments that provide exposure to such fixed-income instruments. Middle market is used to refer to companies with between 5 million and 200 million of annual earnings before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization EBITDA excluding certain one-time and non-recurring items that are outside the operations of these companies. While, as a result of fluctuations in the net asset value NAV of one asset relative to other assets, private middle-market credit obligations and related instruments may represent less than 80 of our net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) at any time, we may not invest, under normal circumstances, more than 20 of our net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in securities and other instruments that are not private middle-market credit obligations and related instruments. To the extent we determine to invest indirectly in private middle-market credit obligations and related instruments, we may invest through certain synthetic instruments, including derivatives that have similar economic characteristics to private middle-market credit obligations. For purposes of determining compliance with our 80 policy, each applicable derivative instrument will be valued based upon its market value. We will notify our unitholders (the Unitholders at least 60 days prior to any change to the 80 investment policy described above. 
 We may also originate covenant-lite loans, which are loans with fewer financial maintenance covenants than other obligations, or no financial maintenance covenants. Such covenant-lite loans may not include terms that allow the lender to monitor the performance of the borrower or to declare a default if certain criteria are breached. These flexible covenants (or the absence of covenants) could permit borrowers to experience a significant downturn in their results of operations without triggering any default that would permit holders of their debt (such as us) to accelerate indebtedness or negotiate terms and pricing. In the event of default, covenant-lite loans may recover less value than traditional loans as the lender may not have an opportunity to negotiate with the borrower prior to such default. 
 We expect to directly or indirectly invest at least 70 of our total assets in middle-market companies domiciled in the United States. However, we may from time to time invest opportunistically in large U.S. companies, non-U.S. companies, stressed or distressed debt, structured products, private equity or other opportunities, subject to limits imposed by the Investment Company Act.

Table of Contents 

 While our investment program is expected to focus primarily on debt investments, our investments may include equity features, such as a direct investment in the equity or convertible securities of a portfolio company or warrants or options to buy a minority interest in a portfolio company. Any warrants we may receive with debt securities will generally require only a nominal cost to exercise, so as a portfolio company appreciates in value, we may achieve additional investment return from these equity investments. We may structure the warrants to provide provisions protecting our rights as a minority-interest holder, as well as puts, or rights to sell such securities back to the portfolio company, upon the occurrence of specified events. In many cases, we may also obtain registration rights in connection with these equity investments, which may include demand and piggyback registration rights. 
 For a discussion of the competitive landscape we face, please see Item 1A. Risk Factors Competition We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities and Item 1. Business Competitive Advantages in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 KEY COMPONENTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Investments 
 Our level of investment activity can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment, the amount of capital we have available to us and the competitive environment for the type of investments we make. 
 As a BDC, we may not acquire any assets other than qualifying assets specified in the Investment Company Act, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70 of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). Qualifying assets include investments in eligible portfolio companies. Pursuant to rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), eligible portfolio companies include certain companies that do not have any securities listed on a national securities exchange and public companies whose securities are listed on a national securities exchange but whose market capitalization is less than 250 million. 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenues in the form of interest income on debt investments and, to a lesser extent, capital gains and distributions, if any, on equity securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies. Some of our investments may provide for deferred interest payments or payment-in-kind PIK income. The principal amount of the debt investments and any accrued but unpaid interest generally becomes due at the maturity date. 
 We generate revenues primarily through receipt of interest income from the investments we hold. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, structuring, syndication, exit fees or diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. Portfolio company fees (directors fees, consulting fees, administrative fees, tax advisory fees and other similar compensation) will be paid to us, unless, to the extent required by applicable law or exemptive relief, if any, therefrom, we receive our allocable portion of such fees when invested in the same portfolio company as other client accounts managed by our Investment Adviser (collectively with the Company, the Accounts ), which other Accounts could receive their allocable portion of such fee. We do not expect to receive material fee income as it is not our principal investment strategy. We record contractual prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income. 
 Dividend income on preferred equity investments is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity investments is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies and on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. Interest and dividend income are presented net of withholding tax, if any. 
 Expenses 
 Our primary operating expenses include the payment of the management fee (the Management Fee and the incentive fee (the Incentive Fee to our Investment Adviser, legal and professional fees, interest and other debt expenses and other operating and overhead related expenses. The Management Fee and Incentive Fee compensate our Investment Adviser for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, closing and monitoring our investments. Pursuant to an investment advisory agreement with the Investment Adviser (the Investment Advisory Agreement ), Company expenses borne by us in the ordinary course on an annual basis (excluding Management Fees, Incentive Fees, organizational and start-up expenses and leverage-related expenses) will not exceed an amount equal to 0.5 of the aggregate amount of commitments to us by holders of common units of our limited liability company interests Units provided, however, that expenses incurred outside of the ordinary course, including litigation and similar expenses, are not subject to such cap. We bear all other expenses of our operations and transactions in accordance with our Investment Advisory Agreement and administration agreement (the Administration Agreement ), including: 
 	 our operational and organizational expenses; 
 	fees and expenses, including travel expenses, incurred by our Investment Adviser or payable to third parties related to our investments, including, among others, professional fees (including the fees and expenses of consultants and experts) and fees and expenses from evaluating, monitoring, researching and performing due diligence on investments and prospective investments; 
 	interest, fees and other expenses payable on indebtedness for borrowed money (including through the issuance of notes and other evidence of indebtedness), other indebtedness, financings or extensions of credit, if any, incurred by us; 
 	fees and expenses incurred by us in connection with membership in investment company organizations; 
 	brokers commissions;

 Our Investment Adviser will not be required to pay expenses of activities which are primarily intended to result in sales of Units. 
 We expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or decline as a percentage of total assets during periods of asset growth and to increase during periods of asset declines. 
 Leverage 
 The revolving credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the JPM Revolving Credit Facility ), allows us to borrow money and lever our investment portfolio, subject to the limitations of the Investment Company Act, with the objective of increasing our yield. This is known as leverage and could increase or decrease returns to our Unitholders. The use of leverage involves significant risks. As a BDC, with certain limited exceptions, we are only permitted to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage ratio, as defined in the Investment Company Act, equals at least 150 after such borrowing (if certain requirements are met). As of September 30, 2024, the revolving credit facility between us and MUFG Bank Ltd. (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the MUFG Revolving Credit Facility , and together with the JPM Revolving Credit Facility, the Revolving Credit Facilities matured and was terminated. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our asset coverage ratio based on the aggregate amount outstanding of our senior securities (which includes the Revolving Credit Facilities, as applicable) was 198 and 181 . Short-term credits necessary for the settlement of securities transactions and arrangements with respect to securities lending will not be considered borrowings for these purposes. Practices and investments that may involve leverage but are not considered borrowings are not subject to the Investment Company Act s asset coverage requirement. The amount of leverage that we employ will depend on the assessment by our Investment Adviser and our board of directors (the Board of Directors or the Board of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing.

(1) The weighted average yield of our portfolio does not represent the total return to our Unitholders. 

(2) Computed based on (a) the annual actual interest rate or yield earned plus amortization of fees and discounts on the performing debt and other income producing investments as of the reporting date, divided by (b) the total investments (including investments on non-accrual and non-income producing investments) at amortized cost or fair value. 

(3) The calculation includes incremental yield earned on the last-out portion of the unitranche loan investments. 

(4) Computed based on (a) the stated coupon rate, if any, for each income-producing investment, divided by (b) the total investments (including investments on non-accrual and non-income producing investments) at amortized cost or fair value. 

As of September 30, 2024, the total portfolio weighted average yield measured at amortized cost and fair value was 11.0 and 12.6 , as compared to 11.6 and 12.7 as of December 31, 2023. Within Unsecured Debt, the decrease in weighted average yield at cost and fair value was primarily driven by the sale of Zodiac Intermediate, LLC (dba Zipari), a first lien debt investment, to mPulse Mobile, Inc. (dba Zipari Inc.), a non-income producing security.

 For a particular portfolio company, we calculate the level of contractual indebtedness net of cash net debt owed by the portfolio company and compare that amount to measures of cash flow available to service the net debt. To calculate net debt, we include debt that is both senior and pari passu to the tranche of debt owned by us but exclude debt that is legally and contractually subordinated in ranking to the debt owned by us. We believe this calculation method assists in describing the risk of our portfolio investments, as it takes into consideration contractual rights of repayment of the tranche of debt owned by us relative to other senior and junior creditors of a portfolio company. We typically calculate cash flow available for debt service at a portfolio company by taking EBITDA for the trailing twelve-month period. Weighted average net debt to EBITDA is weighted based on the fair value of our debt investments, excluding investments where net debt to EBITDA may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk, such as cash collateralized loans and investments that are underwritten and covenanted based on recurring revenue. 

For a particular portfolio company, we also calculate the level of contractual interest expense owed by the portfolio company and compare that amount to EBITDA interest coverage ratio ). We believe this calculation method assists in describing the risk of our portfolio investments, as it takes into consideration contractual interest obligations of the portfolio company. Weighted average interest coverage is weighted based on the fair value of our performing debt investments, excluding investments where interest coverage may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk, such as cash collateralized loans and investments that are underwritten and covenanted based on recurring revenue. 

Median EBITDA is based on our debt investments, excluding investments where net debt to EBITDA may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk, such as cash collateralized loans and investments that are underwritten and covenanted based on recurring revenue. 

Portfolio company statistics are derived from the most recently available financial statements of each portfolio company as of the reported end date. Statistics of the portfolio companies have not been independently verified by us and may reflect a normalized or adjusted amount. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, investments where net debt to EBITDA may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk represented 22.1 and 38.0 of total debt investments at fair value.

 Our Investment Adviser monitors, on an ongoing basis, the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if it is meeting its respective business plan and to assess the appropriate course of action for each portfolio company. Our Investment Adviser has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include the following: (i) assessment of success in adhering to the portfolio company s business plan and compliance with covenants; (ii) periodic or regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; (iii) comparisons to our other portfolio companies in the industry, if any; (iv) attendance at and participation in Board meetings or presentations by portfolio companies; and (v) review of monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections of portfolio companies. 
 As part of the monitoring process, our Investment Adviser also employs an investment rating system to categorize our investments. In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, our Investment Adviser grades the credit risk of all investments on a scale of 1 to 4 no less frequently than quarterly. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to our initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment (i.e., at the time of origination or acquisition), although it may also take into account in certain circumstances the performance of the portfolio company s business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors. The grading system for our investments is as follows: 
 	 Grade 1 investments involve the least amount of risk to our initial cost basis. The trends and risk factors for this investment since origination or acquisition are generally favorable, which may include the performance of the portfolio company or a potential exit; 
 	 Grade 2 investments involve a level of risk to our initial cost basis that is similar to the risk to our initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition. This portfolio company is generally performing as expected and the risk factors to our ability to ultimately recoup the cost of our investment are neutral to favorable. All investments or acquired investments in new portfolio companies are initially assessed a grade of 2; 
 	 Grade 3 investments indicate that the risk to our ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has increased materially since origination or acquisition, including as a result of factors such as declining performance and non-compliance with debt covenants; however, payments are generally not more than 120 days past due; and 
 	 Grade 4 investments indicate that the risk to our ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has substantially increased since origination or acquisition, and the portfolio company likely has materially declining performance. For debt investments with an investment grade of 4, in most cases, most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. For investments graded 4, it is anticipated that we will not recoup our initial cost basis and may realize a substantial loss of our initial cost basis upon exit. 
 Our Investment Adviser grades the investments in our portfolio at least each quarter and it is possible that the grade of a portfolio investment may be reduced or increased over time. For investments with a grade of 3 or 4, our Investment Adviser enhances its level of scrutiny over the monitoring of such portfolio company. The following table shows the composition of our portfolio (excluding investments in money market funds, if any) on the 1 to 4 grading scale:

 Investments are placed on non-accrual status when it is probable that principal, interest or dividends will not be collected according to the contractual terms. Accrued interest or dividends generally are reversed when an investment is placed on non-accrual status. Interest or dividend payments received on non-accrual investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment. Non-accrual investments are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest or dividends are paid and, in management s judgment, principal and interest or dividend payments are likely to remain current. We may make exceptions to this treatment if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.

 FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 The primary use of existing funds and any funds raised in the future is expected to be for our investments in portfolio companies, cash distributions to our Unitholders or for other general corporate purposes, including paying for operating expenses or debt service to the extent we borrow or issue senior securities. 
 We expect to generate cash primarily from the net proceeds of any future offerings of securities, drawdowns of capital commitments, future borrowings and cash flows from operations. To the extent we determine that additional capital would allow us to take advantage of additional investment opportunities, if the market for debt financing presents attractively priced debt financing opportunities, or if our Board of Directors otherwise determines that leveraging our portfolio would be in our best interest and the best interests of our Unitholders, we may enter into credit facilities in addition to our JPM Revolving Credit Facility, or issue other senior securities. We would expect any such credit facilities may be secured by certain of our assets and may contain advance rates based upon pledged collateral. The pricing and other terms of any such facilities would depend upon market conditions when we enter into any such facilities as well as the performance of our business, among other factors. As a BDC, with certain limited exceptions, we are only permitted to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage ratio, as defined in the Investment Company Act, is at least 150 after such borrowing (if certain requirements are met). See Key Components of Operations Leverage . As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our asset coverage ratio based on the aggregate amount outstanding of our senior securities (which includes the Revolving Credit Facilities, as applicable) was 198 and 181 . We may also refinance or repay any of our indebtedness at any time based on our financial condition and market conditions. 
 We may enter into investment commitments through signed commitment letters, that may ultimately become investment transactions in the future. We regularly evaluate and carefully consider our unfunded commitments using GSAM s proprietary risk management framework for the purpose of planning our capital resources and ongoing liquidity, including our financial leverage. 
 We began accepting subscription agreements Subscription Agreements from investors acquiring common Units in our private offering. Under the terms of the Subscription Agreements, investors are required to make capital contributions up to the amount of their undrawn capital commitment to purchase Units each time we deliver a drawdown notice. As of the dates indicated, we had aggregate capital commitments and undrawn capital commitments from investors as follows:

(1) We may borrow amounts in USD or certain other permitted currencies. Debt outstanding denominated in currencies other than USD has been converted to USD using the applicable foreign currency exchange rate as of the applicable reporting date. As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding borrowings denominated in USD of 1,145.50 million, in Canadian Dollars (CAD) of CAD 0.15 million and in Great British Pounds (GBP) of GBP 16.20 million. 

MUFG Revolving Credit Facility 
 We entered into the MUFG Revolving Credit Facility on May 7, 2019 with MUFG Bank Ltd., as administrative agent (the Administrative Agent ), lead arranger, letter of credit issuer and a lender, and the other lenders from time to time party thereto. We amended the MUFG Revolving Credit Facility on numerous occasions between July 31, 2019 and May 4, 2023. The MUFG Revolving Credit Facility matured on May 3, 2024 and was terminated in accordance with its terms. 
 Subject to availability under the Borrowing Base, the maximum principal amount of the MUFG Revolving Credit Facility was 50.05 million until May 3, 2024. The Borrowing Base was calculated based on the unfunded capital commitments of the investors meeting various eligibility requirements (subject to investor concentration limits) multiplied by specified advance rates. The stated maturity date of the MUFG Revolving Credit Facility was May 3, 2024, following our exercise of its maturity extension on October 5, 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no amounts outstanding under the MUFG Revolving Credit Facility. 
 Under the MUFG Revolving Credit Facility, we had the ability to elect, for loans denominated in U.S. Dollars, either Term SOFR with a one-, three- or, if available, six-month tenor or the alternative base rate at the time of draw-down (and with respect to loans denominated in non-U.S. Dollar currencies, the applicable benchmark specified in the MUFG Revolving Credit Facility), and loans denominated in U.S. Dollars may have been converted from one rate to another at any time, subject to certain conditions. The interest rate on obligations under the MUFG Revolving Credit Facility was (A) Term SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment for the applicable tenor (or other listed offered rate, depending upon the currency of borrowing) plus 2.75 per annum or (B) an alternative base rate (the greatest of the prime rate set by MUFG Bank, Ltd., the federal funds rate plus 0.50 , and Term SOFR with a one-month tenor plus 1.00 ABR )) plus 1.75 per annum. We paid a 0.35 annualized fee on a quarterly basis on committed but undrawn amounts under the MUFG Revolving Credit Facility. 
 For further details, see Note 6 Debt MUFG Revolving Credit Facility to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
 
 JPM Revolving Credit Facility 
 On September 24, 2020, Goldman Sachs Private Middle Market Credit II SPV II LLC SPV entered into the JPM Revolving Credit Facility. JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association JPM serves as administrative agent, U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association serves as collateral agent and collateral administrator, U.S. Bank National Association serves as securities intermediary and the Company serves as portfolio manager under the JPM Revolving Credit Facility. The Company amended the JPM Revolving Credit Facility on numerous occasions between February 12, 2021 and March 14, 2024.

Table of Contents 

 Borrowings under the JPM Revolving Credit Facility bear interest (at SPV s election) at a per annum rate equal to (x) Term SOFR (or the applicable benchmark for loans denominated in non-U.S. Dollar currencies) plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.15 (or other listed offered rate, depending upon the currency of borrowing) in effect and, (y) to the extent Term SOFR is unavailable, a rate per annum equal to the greater of (i) the prime rate of JPM in effect on such day and (ii) the Federal Funds Effective Rate in effect on such day plus 0.50 , in each case, plus the applicable margin. The applicable margin is 2.55 per annum, after giving effect to the amendment dated March 14, 2024. SPV will also pay a commitment fee of 0.55 per annum on the average daily unused amount of the financing commitments until the last day of the reinvestment period (as defined in the JPM Revolving Credit Facility), and an administrative fee of 0.20 per annum on the total commitment. The JPM Revolving Credit Facility is a multicurrency facility. As of September 30, 2024, the total commitments under the JPM Revolving Credit Facility were 1,650.00 million. The JPM Revolving Credit Facility also has an accordion feature, subject to the satisfaction of various conditions, which could bring total commitments under the JPM Revolving Credit Facility to 2,000.00 million. All amounts outstanding under the JPM Revolving Credit Facility must be repaid by the sixth anniversary of the JPM Revolving Credit Facility, subject to a six-month extension of the maturity date with the consent of the administrative agent at that time. The stated scheduled termination date of the JPM Revolving Credit Facility is September 24, 2026. 
 SPV s obligations to the lenders under the JPM Revolving Credit Facility are secured by a first priority security interest in all of SPV s portfolio of investments and cash. The obligations of SPV under the JPM Revolving Credit Facility are non-recourse to us, and our exposure under the JPM Revolving Credit Facility is limited to the value of our investment in SPV. 
 For further details, see Note 6 Debt JPM Revolving Credit Facility to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We may become a party to investment commitments and to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of our business to fund investments and to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. These instruments may include commitments to extend credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. As of September 30, 2024, we believed that we had adequate financial resources to satisfy our unfunded commitments. Our unfunded commitments to provide funds to portfolio companies were as follows:

HEDGING 
 Subject to applicable provisions of the Investment Company Act and applicable Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC") regulations, we may enter into hedging transactions in a manner consistent with SEC guidance. To the extent that any of our loans are denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars, we may enter into currency hedging contracts to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We may also enter into interest rate hedging agreements. Such hedging activities, which will be subject to compliance with applicable legal requirements, may include the use of futures, options, swaps and forward contracts. Costs incurred in entering into such contracts or in settling them, if any, will be borne by us. Our Investment Adviser has claimed no-action relief from CFTC registration and regulation as a commodity pool operator pursuant to a CFTC Rule 4.5 with respect to our operations, with the result that we will be limited in our ability to use futures contracts or options on futures contracts or engage in swap transactions. Specifically, CFTC Rule 4.5 imposes strict limitations on using such derivatives other than for hedging purposes, whereby the use of derivatives not used solely for hedging purposes is generally limited to situations where (i) the aggregate initial margin and premiums required to establish such positions does not exceed five percent of the liquidation value of our portfolio, after taking into account unrealized profits and unrealized losses on any such contracts it has entered into; or (ii) the aggregate net notional value of such derivatives does not exceed 100 of the liquidation value of our portfolio. Moreover, we anticipate entering into transactions involving such derivatives to a very limited extent solely for hedging purposes or otherwise within the limitations of CFTC Rule 4.5. 
 Rule 18f-4 under the Investment Company Act includes limitations on the ability of a BDC (or a RIC) to use derivatives and other transactions that create future payment or delivery obligations (including reverse repurchase agreements and similar financing transactions). Under the rule, BDCs that make significant use of derivatives are subject to a value-at-risk leverage limit, a derivatives risk management program, testing requirements and requirements related to board reporting. These requirements apply unless the BDC qualifies as a limited derivatives user, as defined in Rule 18f-4. Under the rule, a BDC may enter into an unfunded commitment agreement that is not a derivatives transaction, such as an agreement to provide financing to a portfolio company, if the BDC has, among other things, a reasonable belief, at the time it enters into such an agreement, that it will have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet its obligations with respect to all of its unfunded commitment agreements, in each case as it becomes due. Under Rule 18f-4, when we trade reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions, including certain tender option bonds, we need to aggregate the amount of any other senior securities representing indebtedness (e.g., bank borrowings, if applicable) when calculating our asset coverage ratio. We currently operate as a limited derivatives user and these requirements may limit our ability to use derivatives and/or enter into certain other financial contracts.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ materially. 
 For a description of our critical accounting policies, see Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. We consider the most significant accounting policies to be those related to our Investments, Revenue Recognition, Non-Accrual Investments, Distributions, and Income Taxes. We consider the most significant critical estimate to be the fair value measurement of investments. The critical accounting policies and estimates should be read in connection with our risk factors listed under Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Fair Value Measurement of Investments 
 Consistent with GAAP and the Investment Company Act, we conduct a valuation of our investments, pursuant to which our NAV is determined. Our investments are valued on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if required under the Investment Company Act. The determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. The majority of investments are not quoted or traded in an active market and as such their fair values are determined using valuation techniques, primarily discounted cash flows, market multiples, and recent comparable transactions. The most significant inputs in applying the discounted cash flow approach and the market multiples approach are the selected discount rates and multiples, respectively. The selection of these inputs is based on a combination of factors that are specific to the underlying portfolio companies such as financial performance and certain factors that are observable in the market such as current interest rates and comparable public company trading multiples. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements express the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of these valuations and any change in these valuations on the consolidated financial statements. For further details of our investments and fair value measurement accounting policy, see Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies Investments and Note 5 Fair Value Measurement. 
 
 RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 
 On November 7, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a distribution equal to an amount up to our taxable earnings per Unit, including net investment income (if positive) for the period October 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024, payable on or about January 28, 2025 to Unitholders of record as of December 31, 2024.

 ITEM 3.	QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are subject to financial market risks, most significantly changes in interest rates. Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in our earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. Because we expect to fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is expected to be affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, we can offer no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, on a fair value basis, 100.0 and 100.0 of our performing debt investments bore interest at a floating rate. Our borrowings under the JPM Revolving Credit Facility and the MUFG Revolving Credit Facility, as applicable, bear interest at a floating rate. 
 We regularly measure our exposure to interest rate risk. We assess interest rate risk and manage our interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis by comparing our interest rate sensitive assets to our interest rate sensitive liabilities. 
 Based on our September 30, 2024 Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, the following table shows the annual impact on net income of base rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate floors for variable rate instruments) assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure:

We may, in the future, hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the Investment Company Act, applicable CFTC regulations and in a manner consistent with SEC guidance. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments with fixed interest rates. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this report, our management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 ARTICLE III 
 ADDITIONAL TERMS APPLICABLE TO THE ADVANCES 
 SECTION 3.01. The Advances . 
 (a) Making the Advances . If the Lenders are required to make an Advance to the Company as provided in Section 2.03, then each Lender shall make such Advance by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer in the applicable Currency of immediately available funds to the Collateral Agent for deposit to the Principal Collection Account, or, if such Advances are denominated in a Permitted Non-USD Currency, the applicable Permitted Non-USD Currency Principal Collection Account. Each Lender at its option may make any Advance by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Advance; provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the Company to repay such Advance in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Company may borrow and prepay Advances. During the Reinvestment Period, the Company may prepay and reborrow any or all of the Revolving Amount. After the Reinvestment Period, once drawn, Advances may not be reborrowed. 

- 41 - 

 (b) Interest on the Advances . Subject to Section 3.01(h), all outstanding Advances shall bear interest (from and including the date on which such Advance is made to and including the date on which such Advance is repaid) at a per annum rate equal to the applicable Reference Rate for each Calculation Period in effect plus the Applicable Margin for such Advances set forth on the Transaction Schedule; provided that, following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, all outstanding Advances and any unpaid interest thereon shall bear interest (from and including the date of such Event of Default) at a per annum rate equal to the applicable Reference Rate for each Calculation Period in effect plus the Adjusted Applicable Margin. For purposes of the foregoing, the Reference Rate for each Calculation Period with respect to Daily Simple SONIA shall be the weighted average of such Reference Rate as determined on each day during such Calculation Period in respect of Advances denominated in GBP. 

(c) Evidence of the Advances . Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Company to such Lender resulting from each Advance made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal, Currency, and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Company, shall maintain at one of its offices a register (the Register in which it shall record from time to time (1) the names, addresses and Commitment amounts of the Lenders, (2) the amount and Currency of each Advance made hereunder, (3) the amount and Currency of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Company to each Lender hereunder and (4) the amount and Currency of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof. The entries made in the Register maintained pursuant to this paragraph (c) shall be conclusive absent manifest error and the Company, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement; provided that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such Register or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Company to repay the Advances in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon its receipt of a duly completed assignment and assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the Administrative Agent shall accept such assignment and assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Company and any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. In the event of a conflict between the accounts maintained by the Lenders and the entries in the Register, the entries in the Register shall govern. 

Any Lender may request that Advances made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the Company shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to such Lender and its registered assigns and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Thereafter, the Advances evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to such payee and its registered assigns. 
 (d) Pro Rata Treatment . Except as otherwise provided herein, all borrowings of, and payments in respect of, the Advances shall be made on a pro rata basis by or to the Lenders in accordance with their respective portions of the Financing Commitments in respect of Advances held by them. 

(e) Illegality . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Lender or the Administrative Agent shall notify the Company that the adoption of any law, rule or regulation, or any change therein or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, makes it unlawful, or any Governmental Authority asserts that it is unlawful, for a Lender or the Administrative Agent to perform its obligations hereunder to fund or maintain Advances in a specific Currency hereunder, then (1) the obligation of such Lender or the Administrative Agent hereunder to fund or maintain Advances in such Currency shall immediately be suspended until such time as such Lender or the Administrative Agent determines (in its sole discretion) that such performance is again lawful, (2) at the request of the Company, such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall use reasonable efforts (which will not require such party to incur a loss, other than immaterial, incidental expenses), until such time as the Advances in such Currency are required to be prepaid 

- 42 - 

 as required under clause (3) below, to transfer all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates with respect to which such performance would not be unlawful, and (3) if such Lender or the Administrative Agent is unable to effect a transfer under clause (2), then, (I) any outstanding Advances in such Currency of such Lender shall be promptly paid in full by the Company (together with all accrued interest and other amounts owing hereunder) but not later than the earlier of (x) if the Company requests such Lender or the Administrative Agent to take the actions set forth in clause (2) above, 20 calendar days after the date on which such Lender or the Administrative Agent notifies the Company in writing that it is unable to transfer its rights and obligations with respect to Advances in such Currency under this Agreement as specified in such clause (2) and (y) such date as shall be mandated by law or (II) if requested by the Portfolio Manager or the Company, any outstanding Advances in such Currency shall be converted to an Advance denominated in USD on the date specified by the Administrative Agent at the Spot Rate and shall become denominated and payable in USD and thereafter shall bear interest at the rates applicable to Advances denominated in USD and the Company shall pay all amounts owing in connection therewith, including all interest accrued on the Advances being converted through such date; provided that, to the extent that any such adoption or change makes it unlawful for the Advances in such Currency to bear interest by reference to the Reference Rate, then the foregoing clauses (1) through (3) shall not apply and the Advances shall bear interest (from and after the last day of the Calculation Period ending immediately after such adoption or change) at a per annum rate equal to the applicable Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin for such Advances set forth on the Transaction Schedule. 

(f) Increased Costs . 

(i) If any Change in Law shall: 

(A) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, liquidity or similar requirement (including any compulsory loan requirement, insurance charge or other assessment) against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender; 

(B) impose on any Lender, the London interbank market or the SOFR market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Advances made by such Lender; or 

(C) subject any Lender or the Administrative Agent to any Taxes (other than (x) Indemnified Taxes, (y) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (z) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; 

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or the Administrative Agent of making, continuing, converting or maintaining any Advance or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the Administrative Agent hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then, upon request by such Lender or the Administrative Agent, the Company will pay to such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. 
 (ii) If any Lender determines that any Change in Law regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Advances made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time the Company 

- 43 - 

 will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered. 

(iii) A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate, and the basis for such compensation of, such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (i) or (ii) of this Section shall be delivered to the Company and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Company shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 20 days after receipt thereof. 

(iv) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or the Administrative Agent's right to demand such compensation; provided that the Company shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or the Administrative Agent notifies the Company of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or the Administrative Agent's intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. 

(v) Each of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent agrees that it will take such commercially reasonable actions as the Company may reasonably request that will avoid the need to pay, or reduce the amount of, any increased amounts referred to in this Section 3.01(f); provided that no Lender or the Administrative Agent shall be obligated to take any actions that would, in the reasonable opinion of such Lender or the Administrative Agent, subject such Lender or the Administrative Agent to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender or the Administrative Agent (including, without limitation, due to a loss of money). In no event will the Company be responsible for increased amounts referred to in this Section 3.01(f) which relates to any other entities to which any Lender provides financing. 

(vi) If any Lender (A) provides notice of unlawfulness or requests compensation under clause (e) above or this clause (f), (B) [reserved] or (C) does not consent to a Material Amendment consented to by the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders, then the Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon written notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, (i) require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 10.06), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the related transaction documents to an assignee identified by the Company that shall assume such obligations (whereupon such Lender shall be obligated to so assign) or (ii) paydown/terminate such Lender on a non-pro rata basis if the Borrowing Base Test is satisfied, provided that, (w) such assignment or delegation does not conflict with Applicable Law, (x) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Advances, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder through the date of such assignment, (y) a Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply and (z) where the applicable Lender has requested compensation under clause (e) above, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter. No prepayment fee that may otherwise be due hereunder shall be payable to such Lender in connection with any such assignment. 

(g) No Set-off or Counterclaim . Subject to Section 3.03, all payments to be made hereunder by the Company in respect of the Advances shall be made without set-off or counterclaim. 

(h) Interest Rate Unascertainable, Inadequate or Unfair . (i) Subject to clauses (ii), (iii), (iv), (v) and (vi) of this Section 3.01(h), in the event that (A) the Administrative Agent determines (in 

- 44 - 

 its commercially reasonable credit judgment) that adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable interest rates by reference to which the Reference Rate or Term SOFR Reference Rate then being determined is to be fixed (including because the Reuters Screen is not available or published on a current basis) or (B) the Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent that the Reference Rate or Term SOFR Reference Rate for such Calculation Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Advances (or its Advance) for such Calculation Period (determined in their commercially reasonable credit judgment), the Administrative Agent shall forthwith so notify the Company and the Lenders, whereupon the obligations of the Lenders to make any Advance that accrues interest based on the Reference Rate or Term SOFR Reference Rate shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify the Company that the Required Lenders have determined (in their commercially reasonable credit judgment) that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist. Furthermore, if any Advance is outstanding on the date of the Company's receipt of the notice from the Administrative Agent referred to in this Section 3.01(h) , then on the last day of the Calculation Period (or the next succeeding Business Day if such day is not a Business Day), such Advance shall accrue interest at the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin as of such day. 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, if a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior to the Reference Time in respect of any setting of the then-current Benchmark, then (x) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (1) of the definition of Benchmark Replacement for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document and (y) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (2) of the definition of Benchmark Replacement for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders. 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, the Administrative Agent will have the right, in consultation with the Company, to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

(vi) Upon the Company's receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, the Company may revoke any request for conversion to or continuation of Advances to be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, the Company will be deemed to have converted any request for an Advance into a request for a Base Rate Advance or conversion of an outstanding Advance to a Base Rate Advance.

SECTION 3.02. [Reserved] . 
 SECTION 3.03. Taxes . 
 (a) Payments Free of Taxes . All payments to be made hereunder by the Company in respect of the Advances and the Administrative Agency Fee shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by Applicable Law (including FATCA). If any Applicable Law requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by the Company, then the Company shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the Company shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the applicable Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding in respect of Indemnified Taxes been made. 

(b) Payment of Other Taxes by the Company . The Company shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.

(d) Indemnification by the Lenders . Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Company has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Company to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender's failure to comply with the provisions of 10.06 relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.
