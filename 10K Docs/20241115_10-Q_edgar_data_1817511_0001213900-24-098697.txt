instruments that are potentially subject to credit risk consist principally of trade receivables. The Company believes the concentration
of credit risk in its trade receivables is substantially mitigated by its ongoing credit evaluation process and relatively short collection

accounts based upon factors affecting the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends and other information.

to dismiss Rahul Narain s claims for damages associated with the - shares of the Company s common stock.
Rahul Narain has filed a motion for partial summary judgment on his claims for compensation and for damages he alleges associated with
his contention that the Company did not deliver the shares of common stock under a warrant. In that motion he seeks the monetary value
of that stock, which he contends is plus interest, and also seeks partial summary judgment for his claim seeking in
compensation, specifically to the motion, he seeks . His motion also seeks to dismiss the Company s counterclaims. Rahul
Narain has also filed a motion in limine to preclude the Company s expert witness as to damages for some of the Company s
counterclaims. The Court denied the Company s motion for summary judgment and granted Mr. Narain s motion for summary judgment
on his claims on the warrant and for a portion of his salary, giving him a recovery of plus interest as of September 4,
2019 and for his salary of per month for the months of September, October, and November of 2023 plus interest, and denied
the remainder of his motion, including those portions seeking to dismiss the Company s counterclaims and to preclude the Company s
expert witness. The Company has filed a Notice of Appeal of this decision and has also filed a motion to reargue the decision. Following

Subsequently, Mr. Narain served a restraining notice on the Company and has made a motion to appoint a receiver to sell Thoughtful Media
Group Inc. and NusaTrip Inc. and disburse proceeds to Mr. Narain sufficient to satisfy the judgment, granting the receiver the right
to retain counsel and bankers and to pay them from the proceeds of such sale, or in the alternative, directing the Company to pay Mr.
Narain from the sale of any of its assets to satisfy the judgment and enjoining the company from diverting those funds to anyone else
until the judgment is satisfied. The Company bonded the judgment and therefore the Court denied the motion without prejudice. In that
same Order, the Court denied the Company s motion to reargue Mr. Narain s motion for partial summary judgment. Finally, the
parties recently attempted to mediate their claims before the Appellate Division, First Department, however such efforts did not result
in a settlement. The Company intends to continue to defend Mr. Narain s claims vigorously.

O Connor has also filed a motion for partial summary judgment on his cause of action regarding the shares of stock
that were allegedly not delivered and is seeking the cash value of those shares. The Court granted that motion in part, deciding that
Mr. O Connor validly exercised shares under the subject warrant. The Court denied that portion of the motion as
it relates to the value of those shares. Mr. O Connor has not retained an expert to testify as to their value. The Company has
retained an expert who has determined the value of the shares to be significantly less than alleged and issued a report of his opinions.
CVO has filed a motion for summary judgment on its claim for the worth of Series A Preferred Stock, seeking the alleged
cash value of those shares. The Company has opposed that motion, and the motion was denied. In addition, the Company has appealed the
grant of the motion on liability and Mr. O Connor has appealed the denial of the motion on the damages portion. The Company filed
a Notice of Appeal with respect to same. In addition, Mr. O Connor had filed a motion to restrain and enjoin the company from transferring
or otherwise disposing any of its assets, including but not limited to extraordinary cash or equity/option payouts to its directors and
officers and from transferring or otherwise disposing any of its operating assets, including but not limited to Thoughtful Media Group
Inc., NusaTrip Inc., and any other of the Company s majority owned corporate subsidiaries. The motion was denied, but granted in
part to the extent that the Company must promptly inform Mr. O Connor of any agreement(s) to sell its subsidiaries. The Court also
scheduled a valuation hearing for the shares granted in Mr. O Connor s motion for summary judgment which will take place
on May 29 and 30 of 2024. Mr. O Connor has made a motion in limine to preclude the Company s expert from testifying at such
valuation hearing, which has been denied. 

The
third case was brought by the Company against former employees Mr. Narain and Mr. O Connor, in addition to two companies they started,
operating under the name Growth Hero. The Company commenced this action on May 18, 2023. The Company alleges, inter alia, that Narain,
O Connor, and Growth Hero misappropriated the Company s intellectual property and alleges other related torts pertaining
to the business conducted by Growth Hero. The Company brought claims sounding in breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of
good faith and fair dealing, misappropriation of trade secrets, unfair competition, breach of fiduciary duties, violation of the Stored
Communication Act, and for a permanent injunction. The Company seeks damages in an amount to be determined at trial. The Company has
filed a motion to extend the time to service of process on Mr. O Connor and the corporate entities and for leave to serve them
via email, and has also initiated a Hague Convention application for international service upon them. The motion was granted to the extent
that the Company s time to serve Mr. O Connor has been extended, without prejudice to renew. Rahul Narain has been served
with process and has made a motion to dismiss the claims against him. The Company has submitted an opposition to this motion. The motion
was granted due to the Court s opinion that the claims set forth against Mr. Narain in this case were the same as the counterclaims
asserted against Mr. Narain in his lawsuit against the Company. 

The
Company disputes each claim in the above referenced matters and intends to defend the pending actions noted above. The ultimate outcome
of any damages that may become payable if its defence is unsuccessful in whole or in part is not probable nor estimable at this time.
While the Company feels confident in its defence of these pending matters, there can be no assurance that it will prevail and that any
damages that may be awarded will not be material to the results of operations or financial condition of the Company. 

The
Company does not believe any of the foregoing actions will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on its business,
financial condition or operating results.

We
operate certain verticals in SEA: loyalty, lifestyle, telecommunications, digital marketing, and travel as we try to create the next
generation digital ecosystem and loyalty platform. We scaled back our operations in the food and beverage delivery market in 2024. 

Loyalty 

The
Company spent over two years building a cutting edge, proprietary IT architecture to effectively scale and support our ecosystem s
companies, consumers and merchants. Using our loyalty platform, consumers may earn, and merchants may issue, Society Points. The Company
will aggregate the data across various touch points and build a realistic view or consumer behavior and use this behavior to increase
sales across our ecosystem by: cross-pollinating acquired companies with other existing verticals, customer re-targeting, offline and
online behavior prediction and cross promotions and loyalty points. The Company ecosystem becomes a key enabler for our users by converting
this aggregation of data into creation of loyalty for our ecosystem companies to generate revenue. 

Lifestyle 

The
Company has an online lifestyle platform to enable the consumers to purchase high-end brands of all categories under its own brand name
of Leflair . Under the deployment of the Company s smart search engine, consumers search or review their favorite
brands among hundreds of choices in Apparel, Bags Shoes, Accessories, Health Beauty, Home Lifestyle, International,
Women, Men and Kids Babies categories. The platform also allows consumers to order from hundreds of vendor choices with personalized
promotions based on purchase history and location. The platform has also partnered up with a Vietnam-based delivery company, Amilo, to
offer seamless delivery of product from merchant to consumer s home or office at the touch of a button. Consumers can place orders
for delivery or collect at the Company s logistics center. 

49 

Telecommunications

Company also has online telecommunication reseller platform operating under brand name of Gorilla to enable the consumers
to subscribe local mobile data and overseas internet data in different subscription package. Established in Singapore in 2019, Gorilla
utilizes Web3 technology to operate a MVNO for its users in Southeast Asia. With network coverage to over 160 countries, Gorilla offers
a full suite of mobile communication services such as local calls, international roaming, data, and SMS texting. More importantly, Gorilla
enables its customers to convert unused mobile data into digital assets or Gorilla GO Tokens through its innovative proprietary blockchain-based
SwitchBack feature. Gorilla GO Tokens in turn can be redeemed for eVouchers, to offset future bills, or be redeemed for other value-added
services. During the financial period ended March 31, 2024, local mobile data service was ceased operation due to business restructuring
to refocus in overseas internet data. 

Digital
Marketing 

The
acquisition of a digital marketing platform, TMG, amplifies the reach and engagement of the Company s e-commerce ecosystem and
retail partners. Originally founded in 2010, TMG today creates and distributes digital advertising campaigns across its multi-channel
network in both SEA and the US. With its intimate knowledge of local markets, digital marketing technology tools and social commerce
business focus, advertisers leverage TMG s wide influencer network throughout SEA to market and sell advertising inventory exclusively
with specific placement and effect. 

As
a result, Thoughtful Media s content creator partners earn a larger share of advertising revenues from international consumer brands.
Thoughtful Media s data-rich multi-channel network has uploaded over 675,000 videos with over 80 billion video views. The current
network of 263 YouTube channels has onboarded over 85 million subscribers with an average monthly viewership of over 600 million views. 

Travel 

The
Company purchased the Nusatrip Group, a leading Jakarta-based Online Travel Agency OTA in Indonesia and across SEA. The
Nusatrip acquisition extended the Company s business reach into SEA regional travel industry and marked the Company s first
foray into Indonesia. Established in 2013 as the first Indonesian OTA accredited by the International Air Transport Association,
Nusatrip pioneered offering a comprehensive range of airlines and hotels to Indonesian corporate and retail customers. With its first
mover advantage, Nusatrip has onboarded over 1.2 million registered users, over 500 airlines and over 200,000 hotels around the world
as well as connected with over 80 million unique visitors. During the year, Nusatrip Group also acquired two Vietnam based companies
having branding name of VLeisure and VIT selling air ticket, hotel reservation and providing hotel management
software to local market. 

Our
loyalty-focused and data-driven e-commerce marketing platform interfaces will connect consumers with merchants in the F B and lifestyle
sectors, assisting local brick-and-mortar businesses to access new customers and markets to thrive in an increasingly convenience-driven
economy. Our Platform will integrate with both global and country-specific search engines and applications and accept international address
and phone number data, providing a consumer experience that respects local languages, address formats and customs. Our plan is to have
Strategic Partners work with us to penetrate local markets, while our Platform allows effortless integration with existing technological
applications and websites.

Revenue .
We generated revenues of 1,675,894 and 2,269,066 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 we generated revenue of 5,233,483 and 6,498,878, respectively. The decrease in revenue
for three and nine months periods was mainly due to decrease in the sales from online ordering as business scale down, digital marketing
as lower project execution and online ticketing and reservation business as system upgrading interruption.

Gross
Income. We recorded a gross income of 365,646 and 562,564 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded a gross income of 1,322,600 and 1,825,960, respectively. The
decrease in gross income is due to decreased gross income from revenue from digital marketing and online ticketing and reservation business.
Gross income margin was 22 and 28 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, our gross income margin was 25 and 28 respectively. Decrease in gross margin for the three and nine months
periods ended September 30, 2024 was due to lower profit margin across all businesses. 

Sales
and Marketing Expenses S M . We incurred S M expenses of 40,263 and 236,874 for the three months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred S M expenses of 311,096 and
 466,252, respectively. The decrease in S M expense in 2024 was primarily attributable to the planned cost reductions and marketing
strategy redesign. 

Software
Development Cost SDC . We incurred SDC expenses of 13,635 and 12,649 for three months ended September 30, 2024 and
2023, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred SDC expenses of 40,972 and 41,777, respectively.

of 7,192,001 and 14,326,481, respectively. The G A is primarily consisting of the professional costs associated with costs related
to its listing on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange, staff cost and D O insurance cost. The significant decrease is primarily due to effectiveness
of cost control improvement. 

Income
Tax Expense . Our income tax expense for the three months ended September 30,2024 and 2023 was 51,808 and 746, respectively, and
for nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 was 56,802 and 2,414, respectively.

a loss of 6,163,556, as compared to 12,617,489 for the same period ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net loss was primarily
attributable to decreased in G A. The net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes non-cash items including stock-based
compensation for services of 737,248 and depreciation and amortization of 493,306.

assurance it will be able to do so. The Company continually monitors its capital structure and operating plans and evaluates various
potential funding alternatives that may be needed in order to finance the Company s business development activities, general and
administrative expenses and growth strategy. We expect to continue to rely on cash generated through financing from public offerings
or private offerings by our parent company or one or more of our subsidiaries, to finance our operations and future acquisitions. The
Company believes that it has sufficient liquidity to continue its current business plans and operations for at least one year.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimate 

Basis
 of presentation 

The
Company has prepared the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the SEC for interim financial reporting. These financial statements are unaudited and, in our
opinion, include all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments and accruals necessary for a fair presentation of our condensed
balance sheets, statements of operations and other comprehensive loss, statements of stockholders deficit and cash flows for the
periods presented. Operating results for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for
any subsequent quarter or for the full year ending December 31, 2024 due to various factors. Certain information and footnote disclosures
normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP have been omitted in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be
read in conjunction with the 2023 audited financial statements and accompanying notes filed with the SEC. 

Emerging
 Growth Company 

We
are an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, we are
not required to: (i) comply with any new or revised financial accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and
private companies until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies, (ii) provide an auditor s attestation report
on management s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, (iii) comply with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board PCAOB or a supplement
to the auditor s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial
statements of the issuer or (iv) comply with any new audit rules adopted by the PCAOB after April 5, 2012, unless the SEC determines
otherwise. However, we have elected to opt out of the extended transition period discussed in (i) and will therefore comply
with new or revised accounting standards on the applicable dates on which the adoption of such standards are required for non-emerging
growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of such extended transition period for compliance
with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable. 

Use
 of estimates and assumptions 

In
preparing these consolidated financial statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities in the balance sheet and revenues and expenses during the years reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
If actual results significantly differ from the Company s estimates, the Company s financial condition and results of operations
could be materially impacted. Significant estimates in the period include the allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivable,
the incremental borrowing rate used to calculate right of use assets and lease liabilities, valuation and useful lives of intangible
assets, impairment of long-lived assets, valuation of common stock and stock warrants, stock option valuations, imputed interest on amounts
due to related parties, inventory valuation, revenue recognition, the allocation of purchase consideration in business combinations,
and deferred tax assets and the related valuation allowance. 

Basis
 of consolidation 

The
consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant inter-company
balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. 

55 

Business
 combination 

The
Company follows Accounting Standards Codification ASC ASC Topic 805, Business
Combinations ASC 805 and ASC Topic 810, Consolidation ASC
810 ). ASC Topic 805 requires most identifiable assets, liabilities, non-controlling interests, and goodwill acquired in a business
combination to be recorded at fair value. The statement applies to all business combinations. Under ASC 805, all business
combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method. Accounting for the resulting goodwill requires significant management
estimates and judgment. Management performs periodic reviews of the carrying value of goodwill to determine whether events and circumstances
indicate that an impairment in value may have occurred. A variety of factors could cause the carrying value of goodwill to become impaired.
A write-down of the carrying value of goodwill could result in a non-cash charge, which could have an adverse effect on the Company s
results of operations. 

Noncontrolling
 interest 

The
Company accounts for non-controlling interests in accordance with ASC Topic 810, which requires the Company to present non-controlling
interests as a separate component of total shareholders equity on the consolidated balance sheets and the consolidated net loss
attributable to its non-controlling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statements of operations
and comprehensive loss. 

Segment
 reporting 

ASC
Topic 280, Segment Reporting Topic 280 establishes standards for reporting information about operating
segments on a basis consistent with the Company s internal organization structure as well as information about geographical areas,
business segments and major customers in consolidated financial statements. The Company currently operates in six reportable operating
segments: (i) Online Grocery and Food and Groceries Deliveries, (ii) Digital marketing, (iii) Online ticketing and reservation, (iv)
Telecommunications Reseller, (v) e-Commerce, and (vi) Corporate. 

Cash
 and cash equivalents 

Cash
and cash equivalents are carried at cost and represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions
and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as of the purchase date of such investments. As of
September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the cash and cash equivalents excluded restricted cash amounted to 4,220,371 and 3,628,670,
respectively. 

The
Company currently has bank deposits with financial institutions in the U.S. which exceed FDIC insurance limits. FDIC insurance provides
protection for bank deposits up to 250,000, so there were uninsured balance of 0 and 83,152 as of September 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023, respectively. In addition, the Company has uninsured bank deposits of 3,989,977 and 3,262,161 with a financial
institution outside the U.S as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. All uninsured bank deposits are held at high
quality credit institutions. 

Restricted
 cash 

Restricted
cash refers to cash that is held by the Company for specific reasons and is, therefore, not available for immediate ordinary business
use. The restricted cash represented fixed deposit maintained in bank accounts that are pledged. As of September 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023, the restricted cash amounted to 54,100 and 95,312, respectively. 

56 

Accounts
 receivable 

Accounts
receivables are recorded at the amounts that are invoiced to customers, do not bear interest, and are due within contractual payment
terms, generally 30 to 90-days from completion of service or the delivery of a product. Credit is extended based on an evaluation of
a customer s financial condition, the customer s creditworthiness and their payment history. Accounts receivable outstanding
longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due. Past due balances over 90 days and over a specified amount are reviewed
individually for collectability. Quarterly, the Company specifically evaluates individual customer s financial condition, credit
history, and the current economic conditions to monitor the progress of the collection of accounts receivables. The Company records bad
debt expense and records an allowance for doubtful accounts for any estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to
make required payments. For receivables that are past due or not being paid according to payment terms, appropriate actions are taken
to pursue all means of collection, including seeking legal resolution in a court of law. Account balances are charged off against the
allowance for doubtful accounts after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote.
Currently, the Company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its customers, and as of both September 30, 2024
and December 31, 2023, there was no need for allowance for doubtful accounts. 

Inventories 

Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, cost being determined on a first-in-first-out method. Costs include hardware
equipment and peripheral costs which are purchased from the Company s suppliers as merchandized goods. The Company provides inventory
allowances based on excess and obsolete inventories determined principally by customer demand. No allowance for obsolete inventories
was recorded by the Company during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The inventories amounted to 294,487 and
 431,483 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

Prepaid
 expenses 

Prepaid
expenses represent payments made in advance for products or services to be received in the future and are amortized to expense on a ratable
basis over the future period to be benefitted by that expense. The benefits associated with the products or services are considered current
assets if they are expected to be used during the next twelve months and are considered non-current assets if they are expected to be
used over a period greater than one year. 

Plant
 and equipment 

Plant
and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Depreciation is calculated
on the straight-line basis over the following expected useful lives from the date on which they become fully operational and after taking
into account their estimated residual values: 

Expected
 useful lives 

Computer equipment 
 
 3 years 

Office equipment 
 
 5 years 

Renovation 
 
 5 years 

Expenditures
for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. When assets have been retired or sold, the cost and related accumulated depreciation
are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in the results of operations. 

Impairment
 of long-lived assets 

In
accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 360, Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets , all long-lived assets
such as plant and equipment and intangible assets held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is
evaluated by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to its estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated
by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying
amounts of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets. Impairment loss of intangible assets of 135,000 and 0 have been recognized
for the three and nine months period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

57 

Revenue
 recognition 

The
Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ASU
2014-09 ). Under ASU 2014-09, the Company applies the following five steps in order to determine the appropriate amount of revenue
to be recognized as it fulfills its obligations under each of its agreements: 

Identify the contract with
 a customer; 

Identify the performance
 obligations in the contract; 

Determine the transaction
 price; 

Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations
 in the contract; and 

Recognize revenue as the
 performance obligation is satisfied. 

The
Company generates its revenues from a diversified a mix of e-commerce activities that correspond to our six business segments (business
to consumer or B2C ), lifestyle (B2C), grocery and food delivery (B2C), telecommunication reseller (B2C), online ticketing
and reservations (B2C) and the services providing to merchants for their business growth (business to business or B2B ),
merchant POS (B2B), digital marketing (B2B) and online ticketing and reservations (B2B). 

The
Company s performance obligations include providing connectivity between merchants and consumers, generally through an online ordering
platform. The platform allows merchants to create an account, display a menu and track their sale reports on the merchant facing application.
The platform also allows the consumers to create an account and order from merchants on the consumer facing application. The platform
allows a delivery company to accept an online delivery request and deliver or ship an order from a merchant to customer. 

Lifestyle 

The
Company has developed an online lifestyle platform (the Lifestyle Platform under its own brand name of Leflair 
to enable consumers to purchase high-end brands in many categories. Using the Company s smart search engine, consumers search or
review their favorite brands among hundreds of choices in various categories, including Apparel, Bags Shoes, Accessories, Health
 Beauty, Home Lifestyle, International, Women, Men and Kids Babies categories. The Lifestyle Platform also allows customers
to order from hundreds of vendor choices with personalized promotions based on their individual purchase history and location. The platform
has also partnered with a Vietnam-based delivery company, Amilo, to offer seamless delivery of product from merchant to consumer s
home or office at the touch of a button. Consumers can place orders for delivery or can collect their purchases at the Company s
logistics center. 

Grocery
and Food Delivery 

Other
online platforms include online platforms in Vietnam, under the brand name of Handycart , and Philippines, under the brand
names of Pushkart and Mangan , to enable the consumers to purchase meals from restaurants and food from local
grocery and food merchants and deliver to them in their area. This business segment has been progressively ceasing yet the Company has
maintained ongoing involvement in specific operational activities during the three and nine months period ended September 30, 2024. 

Telecommunications 

The
Company operates a Singapore-based online telecommunication reseller platform under brand name of Gorilla to enable the
consumers to subscribe local mobile data and overseas internet data in different subscription package. Established in Singapore in 2019,
Gorilla utilizes blockchain and Web3 technology to operate a MVNO for its users in South East Asia (SEA). With network coverage to over
150 countries, Gorilla offers a full suite of mobile communication services such as local calls, international roaming, data, and SMS
texting. More importantly, Gorilla enables its customers to convert unused mobile data into digital assets or Gorilla GO Tokens through
its innovative proprietary blockchain-based SwitchBack feature. Gorilla GO Tokens in turn can be redeemed for eVouchers, to offset future
bills, or be redeemed for other value-added services. Please visit https://gorilla.global/ for more information. During the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company ceased its local mobile data service operation due to business restructuring to
refocus on overseas internet data services.

Digital
Marketing 

The
acquisition of a digital media platform, TMG, amplifies the reach and engagement of the Company s e-commerce ecosystem and retail
partners. Originally founded in 2010, TMG today creates and distributes digital advertising campaigns across its multi-channel network
in both SEA and the US. With its intimate knowledge of local markets, digital marketing technology tools and social commerce business
focus, advertisers leverage TMG s wide influencer network throughout SEA to market and sell advertising inventory exclusively with
specific placement and effect. 

As

(a) The
 Board of Directors have approved a 10-year stock option at an exercise price of 97.35 per
 share that will be exercisable at any time. 

Leases 

The
Company adopted Topic 842, Leases ASC 842 to determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating
leases are included in operating lease right-of-use ROU assets and operating lease liabilities in the consolidated balance
sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated
balance sheets. 

68 

ROU
assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company s obligation
to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on
the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of the Company s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company
generally use the incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term
of the lease payments at commencement date. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives.
The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that
option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 

In
accordance with the guidance in ASC 842, components of a lease should be split into three categories: lease components (e.g. land, building,
etc.), non-lease components (e.g. common area maintenance, consumables, etc.), and non-components (e.g. property taxes, insurance, etc.).
Subsequently, the fixed and in-substance fixed contract consideration (including any related to non-components) must be allocated based
on the respective relative fair values to the lease components and non-lease components. 

When
a lease is terminated before the expiration of the lease term, irrespective of whether the lease is classified as a finance lease or
an operating lease, the lessee would derecognize the ROU asset and corresponding lease liability. Any difference would be recognized
as a gain or loss related to the termination of the lease. Similarly, if a lessee is required to make any payments or receives any consideration
when terminating the lease, it would include such amounts in the determination of the gain or loss upon termination. 

As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company recorded the right of use asset of 917,836 and 1,407,956, respectively. 

Retirement
 plan costs 

Contributions
to retirement plans (which are defined contribution plans) are charged to general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operation as the related employee service is provided. 

Share-based
 compensation 

The
Company follows ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation ASC
718 ), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards (employee and
non-employee), at grant-date fair value of the equity instruments that an entity is obligated to issue. Restricted stock units are valued
using the market price of the Company s common shares on the date of grant. The Company uses a Black-Scholes option pricing model
to estimate the fair value of employee stock options at the date of grant. As of September 30, 2024, those shares issued and stock options
granted for service compensation, vest 180 days after the grant date, and therefore these amounts are thus recognized as expense during
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Stock-based compensation is recorded in general and administrative expenses
within the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other Comprehensive Loss, with corresponding credits to common stock and accumulated
paid-in capital. 

Warrants 

In
connection with certain financing, consulting and collaboration arrangements, the Company has issued warrants to purchase shares of its
preferred and common stock. The outstanding warrants are standalone instruments that are not puttable or mandatorily redeemable by the
holder and are classified as equity awards. The Company measures the fair value of the awards using a Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model
as of the measurement date. The Company uses a Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of the warrants.
Warrants issued in conjunction with the issuance of common stock are initially recorded at fair value as a reduction in additional paid-in
capital (the accounting treatment for common stock issuance costs). All other warrants are recorded at the grant date fair value as an
expense over the requisite service period, or at the date of issuance if the warrants vest immediately, with corresponding credits to
additional paid-in capital. 

69 

Related
 parties 

The
Company follows ASC 850-10, Related Party Disclosures ASC 850 for the identification of related parties
and the disclosure of related party transactions. 

Pursuant
to ASC 850, the related parties include a) affiliates of the Company; b) entities for which investments in their equity securities would
be required, absent the election of the fair value option under ASC 825, Financial Instruments , to be accounted for by the
equity method by the investing entity; c) trusts for the benefit of employees, such as pension and income-sharing trusts that are managed
by or under the trusteeship of management; d) principal owners of the Company; e) management of the Company; f) other parties with which
the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent
that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests; and g) other parties that can
significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or that have an ownership interest in one of
the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented
from fully pursuing its own separate interests. 

The
condensed consolidated financial statements shall include disclosures of material related party transactions, other than compensation
arrangements, expense allowances, and other similar items in the ordinary course of business. However, disclosure of transactions that
are eliminated in the preparation of consolidated or combined financial statements is not required by ASC 850. The disclosures shall
include: a) the nature of the relationship(s) involved; b) a description of the transactions, including transactions to which no amounts
or nominal amounts were ascribed, for each of the periods for which income statements are presented, and such other information deemed
necessary to an understanding of the effects of the transactions on the financial statements; c) the dollar amounts of transactions for
each of the periods for which income statements are presented and the effects of any change in the method of establishing the terms from
that used in the preceding period; and d) amount due from or to related parties as of the date of each balance sheet presented and, if
not otherwise apparent, the terms and manner of settlement. 

Commitments
 and contingencies 

The
Company follows the ASC 450, Commitments , to account for contingencies. Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial
statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company, but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur
or fail to occur. The Company assesses such contingent liabilities, which assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In
assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in
such proceedings, the Company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits
of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein. 

If
the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability
can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company s consolidated financial statements. If the assessment
indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated,
then the nature of the contingent liability, and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable and material, would be
disclosed. 

Loss
contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed.
Management does not believe, based upon information available, that these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company s
financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, there is no assurance that such matters will not materially and adversely
affect the Company s business, financial position, and results of operations or cash flows if the current level of facts and circumstances
changes in the future. 

70 

Fair
 value of financial instruments 

The
Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial
instruments and has adopted paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification Paragraph 820-10-35-37 to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification establishes
a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value
into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined
by paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification are described below: 

Level 1 
 Quoted market prices available in
 active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. 

Level 2 
 Pricing inputs other than
 quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date. 

Level 3 
 Pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs
 and not corroborated by market data. 

Financial
assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar
techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable. 

The
fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and
the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than
one level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of
the instrument. 

The
carrying amounts of the Company s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, deposits,
prepayments and other receivables, contract liabilities, accrued liabilities and other payables, amounts due to related parties and operating
lease liabilities, approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments. 

Recent
 Accounting Pronouncements 

From
time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standard Board FASB or other standard
setting bodies and adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. 

In
March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-01, Leases (Topic 842): Common Control Arrangements ASU 2023-01 that
is intended to improve the guidance for applying Topic 842 to arrangements between entities under common control. This ASU requires all
entities (that is, including public companies) to amortize leasehold improvements associated with common control leases over the useful
life to the common control group. The standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim
periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for both interim and annual financial statements that have not yet been
made available for issuance. If an entity adopts the amendments in an interim period, it must adopt them as of the beginning of the fiscal
year that includes that interim period. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2023-01 on its consolidated financial
statements. 

71 

In
November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures ASU 2023-07 ), which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced
disclosures about significant segment expenses. The disclosures requirements included in ASU 2023-07 are required for all public entities,
including those with a single reportable segment. ASU 2023-07 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, on a
retrospective basis, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2023-07 on its
consolidated financial statements. 

In
December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 720): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ASU
2023-09 , which prescribes standard categories for the components of the effective tax rate reconciliation and requires disclosure
of additional information for reconciling items meeting certain quantitative thresholds, requires disclosure of disaggregated income
taxes paid, and modifies certain other income tax-related disclosures. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December
15, 2024 and allows for adoption on a prospective basis, with a retrospective option. The Company is currently evaluating the potential
impact of the adoption of ASU 2023-09 on its consolidated financial statements. 

All
other recently issued, but not yet effective, 2024 Accounting Standards Updates are not expected to have an effect on the Company.

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed
by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms promulgated by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Because of the inherent limitations to the
effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, with a company have been prevented or detected on a timely basis. Even
disclosure controls and procedures determined to be effective can only provide reasonable assurance that their objectives are achieved. 

As
of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act. Based upon
that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not
effective at the reasonable assurance level. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) during the
period ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal
control over financial reporting.
