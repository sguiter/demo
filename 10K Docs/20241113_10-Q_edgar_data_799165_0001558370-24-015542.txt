 DAWSON GEOPHYSICAL COMPANY NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT S (UNAUDITED) shares of our common stock issued to Wilks at closing, the Company entered into a convertible note with Wilks in the principal amount of approximately million and convertible into approximately million shares of common stock, contingent upon the Company receiving shareholder approval to issue the shares upon conversion of the convertible note in accordance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5635 (the Convertible Note ). The shareholders approved conversion of the Convertible Note during a special meeting held on September 13, 2023. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Convertible Note was automatically converted into newly-issued shares of the Company s common stock following the requisite shareholder approval, and the Convertible Note was thereby extinguished. The Purchase Agreement has been accounted for as a transfer of net assets between entities under common control in a manner similar to a pooling of interests. The Company s historical consolidated financial statements include the effects on financial position, cash flows, and results of operations attributable to the activities of Breckenridge for all periods presented. The effects of transactions in Breckenridge s equity prior to the Transaction have been presented as a separate component of stockholders equity on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity to demonstrate the effects of those transactions on the Company s historical consolidated financial statements.

While the collectability of outstanding client invoices is continually assessed, the inherent volatility of the energy industry s business cycle can cause swift and unpredictable changes in the financial stability of the Company s clients.

Under both types of agreements, the Company recognizes revenues as the services are performed. Revenue is generally recognized based on square miles of data recorded compared to total square miles anticipated to be recorded on the survey using the total estimated revenue for the service contract. In the case of a cancelled service contract, the client is billed and revenue is recognized for any third party charges and square miles of data recorded up to the date of cancellation. The Company receives reimbursements for certain out-of-pocket expenses under the terms of the service contracts. The amounts billed to clients are included at their gross amount in the total estimated revenue for the service contract. Clients are billed as permitted by the service contract. Contract assets and contract liabilities are the result of timing differences between revenue recognition, billings and cash collections. If billing occurs prior to the revenue recognition or billing exceeds the revenue recognized, the amount is considered deferred revenue and a contract liability. Conversely, if the revenue recognition exceeds the billing,

As a result, all stock options, restricted stock unit awards and restricted stock awards were anti-dilutive and excluded from weighted average shares used in determining the diluted loss per share of common stock for those periods. The following weighted average numbers of stock options, restricted stock unit awards and restricted stock awards have been excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share of common stock, as their effect would be anti-dilutive for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: Convertible Note Total and - , respectively. The Company s effective tax rates were - and for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023. The Company s nominal effective tax rate for the periods above was due to the presence of net operating loss carryovers and adjustments to the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. The Company assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit the use of the existing deferred tax assets. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative loss incurred over an extended amount of time. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as projections for taxable earnings. The Company has recorded valuation allowances against the associated deferred tax assets for the amounts it deems are not more likely than not realizable. Based on management s belief that not all the net operating losses are realizable, a federal valuation allowance and additional state valuation allowances were maintained during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. In addition, due to the Company s recent operating losses and valuation allowances, the Company may recognize reduced or no tax benefits on future losses on the condensed consolidated financial statements. The amount of the valuation allowances considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced or increased, or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as projections for future growth.

The Company disclaims any intention or obligation to revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Overview We are a leading provider of North American onshore seismic data acquisition services with operations throughout the continental U.S. and Canada. Substantially all of our revenues are derived from the seismic data acquisition services we provide to our clients. Our clients consist of major oil and gas companies, independent oil and gas operators, and providers of multi-client data libraries. In recent years, our primary customer base has consisted of providers of multi-client data libraries. Demand for our services depends upon the level of spending by these companies for exploration, production, development and field management activities, which depends, in a large part, on oil and natural gas prices. Significant fluctuations in domestic oil and natural gas exploration and development activities related to commodity prices, as we have recently experienced, have affected, and will continue to affect, demand for our services and our results of operations, and such fluctuations continue to be the single most important factor affecting our business and results of operations. We began the quarter with one crew operating in the United States, and had two small channel crews operating later in the quarter. We currently have one crew operating and a second large channel crew scheduled to deploy in mid-November, which will utilize the majority of our channels in the United States. Our seasonal operations in Canada resumed in October, and we expect increased revenues and profitability from Canada through the first quarter of 2025. We are currently testing new single node channels in the field, and we expect to invest in increasing our channel count through the purchase of new equipment in the near future. We believe that investing in new single node channels will improve our revenue and margins due to improved crew efficiency with the lighter weight equipment. While our revenues are mainly affected by the level of client demand for our services, our revenues are also affected by the pricing for our services that we negotiate with our clients and the productivity and utilization level of our data acquisition crews. Factors impacting productivity and utilization levels include: client demand, commodity prices, whether we enter into turnkey or dayrate contracts with our clients, the number and size of crews, the number of recording channels per crew, crew downtime related to inclement weather, delays in acquiring land access permits, agricultural or hunting activity, holiday schedules, short winter days, crew repositioning and equipment failure. To the extent we experience these factors, our operating results may be affected from quarter to quarter. Consequently, our efforts to negotiate more favorable contract terms in our supplemental service agreements, mitigate permit access delays and improve overall crew productivity may contribute to growth in our revenues. Results of Operations U.S. Fee Revenues . Acquisition revenues for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 52 to 4.7 million compared to 9.7 million for the same period of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in crew utilization. Acquisition revenues for the first nine months of 2024 decreased 4.6 to 31.3 million compared to 32.8 million for the same period of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in crew utilization. Canadian Fee Revenues. Acquisition revenues of 11,000 for the third quarter of 2024 equaled the acquisition revenues for the same period of 2023. Acquisition revenues for the first nine months of 2024 decreased 16 to 8.5 million compared to 10.1 million for the same period of 2023. The decreases in both periods were primarily due to a seasonal decrease in crew utilization. Total Revenues. Revenues for the third quarter of 2024 were 14.4 million compared to 23.0 million for the same period of 2023. Total revenues included a decrease of 3.5 million in reimbursable revenues. Revenues for the first nine months of 2024 were 58.5 million compared to 72.6 million for the same period of 2023. Total revenues included a decrease of 10.9 million in reimbursable revenues.

 U.S. Fee Operating Expenses. Acquisition expenses for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 43 to 5.7 million compared to 10.1 million for the same period of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to an overall decrease in crew production and utilization during the period. Acquisition expenses for the first nine months of 2024 decreased 9 to 26.8 million from 29.4 million for the same period of 2023. The increase was primarily due to an decrease in crew utilization. Canadian Fee Operating Expenses. Acquisition expenses for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 5 to 0.8 million compared to 0.9 million for the same period of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to an overall decrease in crew production and utilization during the period. Acquisition expenses for the first nine months of 2024 decreased 34 to 5.8 million from 8.8 million for the same period of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to decreased crew utilization. Reimbursable Revenues and Costs. These revenues and expenses are passed through to our clients and are job specific and vary significantly from year to year. The costs are agreed to by our clients prior to contracting with outside vendors for the various tasks. General and Administrative Expenses . During the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, general and administrative expenses remained equal totaling 2.5 million for both periods. During the first nine months of 2024 general and administrative expenses decreased 26 to 6.6 million compared to 9.0 million for the same period of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to our focus on cost reduction initiatives, a decrease in retained legal counsel and a reduction in salary expenses. Depreciation and Amortization Expense . Depreciation and amortization expenses for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 totaled 1.4 million and 4.4 million, respectively, compared to 2.0 million and 6.8 million for the same periods of 2023. Depreciation expenses decreased in 2024 compared to 2023 as a result of multiple years of reduced capital expenditures. Total Operating Costs. Total operating costs for the third quarter of 2024 were 20.2 million, representing a 30 decrease from the same period of 2023. The operating costs for the first nine months of 2024 were 62.4 million, representing a 25 decrease from the same period of 2023. The decrease in operating costs for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to the factors described above. Income Taxes . Income tax benefit for the third quarter of 2024 was 35,000 and income tax expense for the first nine months of 2024 was 36,000, respectively, compared to income tax expense of 3,000 and income tax benefit of 96,000 for the same periods of 2023. These amounts represent effective tax rates of 0.6 and -1.1 for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to -0.1 and 0.9 for the same periods of 2023. The Company s nominal effective tax rate for the periods above was due to the presence of net operating loss carryovers and adjustments to the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. Our effective tax rates differ from the statutory federal rate of 21.0 for certain items such as state and local taxes, valuation allowances, and non-deductible expenses. For further information, see Note 9 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Use of Adjusted EBITDA (a Non-GAAP measure) We define Adjusted EBITDA as our net income (loss), before (i) interest expense, net, (ii) income tax expense or benefit, (iii) depreciation, depletion and amortization and (iv) other unusual or non-recurring charges, such as severance expenses. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental financial measure to assess: the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structures, taxes or historical cost basis; our liquidity and operating performance over time in relation to other companies that own similar assets and that we believe calculate Adjusted EBITDA in a similar manner; and the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient for us to pay potential interest costs. 
 We also understand that such data are used by investors to assess our performance. However, the terms EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not defined under GAAP, and neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of operating income, operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. When assessing our operating performance or liquidity, investors and others should not consider this data in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss), cash flow from operating activities or other cash flow data calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, or similarly titled measures utilized by other companies since such other companies may not calculate EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner as us. Further, the results presented by EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA cannot be achieved without incurring the costs that the measure excludes: interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization, and other unusual or non-recurring charges, such as severance expenses.

Our principal uses of cash are the amounts used to provide these services, including expenses related to our operations and acquiring new equipment. Accordingly, our cash position depends (as do our revenues) on the level of demand for our services. Historically, cash generated from our operations along with cash reserves have been sufficient to fund our working capital requirements and, to some extent, our capital expenditures. Management believes cash on hand and working capital are sufficient to fund operating and investing cash flow requirements. Cash Flows . Net cash provided by operating activities was 3.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.5 million for the same period of 2023. This increase was primarily due to various changes in the balances of our operating assets and liabilities. Net cash used in investing activities was 0.9 million and 3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The decrease in cash used in investing activities between periods of 2.5 million was primarily due to a decrease in cash capital expenditures to 1.6 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to capital expenditures of 2.6 million for the same period of 2023. Additionally, in connection with the Breckenridge asset acquisition in 2023 we acquired 1.0 million of short-term investments.

Table of Contents 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 11.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and was primarily comprised of dividends paid of 9.9 million, principal payments of 0.9 million and 0.5 million under our notes payable and finance leases, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities was 3.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and was primarily comprised of principal payments of 0.5 million and 0.2 million under our notes payable and finance leases, respectively. Additionally, in connection with the Breckenridge asset acquisition we had cash distributions of 3.1 million. Capital Expenditures . The Board of Directors approved an initial 2024 capital budget in the amount of 2.5 million for capital expenditures, which was limited to necessary maintenance capital requirements and incremental recording channel replacement or increase. As of September 30, 2024, the Board of Directors increased this budget to 6.0 million to invest in additional single node channels. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we spent 2.5 million on capital expenditures, primarily for rolling stock and maintenance capital requirements. Historically, we have funded most of our capital expenditures through cash flow from operations, cash reserves, equipment term loans and finance leases. Capital Resources . Historically, we have primarily relied on cash flows from operations, cash reserves and borrowings from commercial banks to fund our working capital requirements. Special Cash Dividend . Declared on March 28, 2024, the 0.32 per share special cash dividend on the Company s common stock was paid on May 6, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on April 22, 2024. The aggregate payment was approximately 9.9 million. Loan Agreement Dominion Credit Facility. On September 30, 2019, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Dominion Bank, a Texas state bank Dominion Bank ). On September 30, 2023, we entered into a Fifth Loan Modification Agreement (the Fifth Modification Agreement to the Loan and Security Agreement (as amended by (i) that certain Loan Modification Agreement dated as of September 30, 2020, (ii) that certain Second Loan Modification Agreement dated as of September 30, 2021, (iii) that certain Third Loan Modification Agreement dated as of September 30, 2022, (iv) that certain Fourth Modification Agreement dated as of March 21, 2023, and (v) the Fifth Modification Agreement, the Loan Agreement ). The Loan Agreement provided for a secured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility in an amount up to the lesser of (I) an amount equal to the Borrowing Base or (II) 5 million. Our obligations under the Loan Agreement was secured by a Certificate of Deposit with Dominion Bank for 5 million (the Deposit in our collateral account. On May 2, 2024, the collateral deposit of 5 million was released and the Loan Agreement was terminated. Dominion Letters of Credit. As of September 30, 2024, we have no outstanding letters of credit. Our previously issued letter of credit in the amount of 265,000 was not renewed on August 9, 2024. Other Indebtedness As of September 30, 2024, we have no outstanding short-term notes payable. As of December 31, 2023, we had one outstanding short-term note payable to a finance company for various insurance premiums totaling 910,000. In addition, we lease certain seismic recording equipment and vehicles under leases classified as finance leases. Our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, include finance leases of 2.2 million and 1.8 million, respectively. Maturities and Interest Rates of Debt The following tables set forth the aggregate principal amount (in thousands) under our outstanding notes payable and the interest rates as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023:

 The aggregate maturities of finance leases as of September 30, 2024, are as follows (in thousands):

Contractual Obligations We believe that our capital resources, including our cash on hand, short-term investments and cash flow from operations will be adequate to meet our current operational needs. We believe that we will be able to finance our 2024 capital expenditures through cash flow from operations and borrowings from commercial lenders. However, our ability to satisfy working capital requirements, meet debt repayment obligations, and fund future capital requirements will depend principally upon our future operating performance, which is subject to the risks inherent in our business, and will also depend on the extent to which the current economic climate adversely affects the ability of our customers, and/or potential customers, to promptly pay amounts owing to us under their service contracts with us. Critical Accounting Policies Information regarding our critical accounting policies and estimates is included in Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. ASU 2023-07 seeks to improve disclosures about a public entity s reportable segments and add disclosures around a reportable segment s expenses. The updated guidance is effective for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2024, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning January 1, 2025. We are evaluating the impacts of adoption, which will be limited to additional disclosures. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. ASU 2023-09 seeks to improve transparency of income tax disclosures by requiring consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disclosures. The updated guidance is effective for us on January 1, 2025. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2023-09 to have a material impact on our financial statements and disclosures. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIV E DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK There has been no material change in our market risk profile during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For additional information about our market risk profile, refer to "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in Item 7A. in Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. We are exposed to certain market risks arising from the use of financial instruments in the ordinary course of business. These risks arise primarily as a result of potential changes to operating concentration of credit risk and changes in interest rates. We have not entered into any hedge arrangements, commodity swap agreements, commodity futures, options or other derivative financial instruments. We also conduct business in Canada, which subjects our results of operations and cash flows to foreign currency exchange rate risk.
