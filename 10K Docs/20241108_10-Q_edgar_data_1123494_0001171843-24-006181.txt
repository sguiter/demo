The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020 CARES Act provided an employee retention tax credit ERTC that was a refundable tax credit against certain employer taxes. The Company elected to account for the credit as a government grant. As there is no authoritative guidance under U.S. GAAP on accounting for grants to for-profit business entities from government entities, the Company accounts for government assistance by analogy to International Accounting Standards Topic 20, Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance IAS 20 ). Under IAS 20, government grants are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and that all conditions related to the grant will be met. 

The Company received ERTC refunds of million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Due to the subjectivity of the credit, the Company has included the refunds received in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024, subject to a determination that the refunds are recognizable. 

The Company engaged a professional services firm under a commission fee arrangement to assist with determining the Company s eligibility to claim the ERTC refunds and accumulating the necessary support that was used as a basis in the filing. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company paid fees of million for these services, which are included in other operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations.

The Company maintains a Credit Agreement (as amended, the Credit Agreement with Citizens Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, and First Citizens Bank Trust Company (together, the Lenders ). The Credit Agreement provides for a term loan of million and a million revolving credit facility (including a million sub-facility for the issuance of letters of credit and a million swingline loan sub facility) (collectively, the Credit Facility ). The Company s obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of Harvard Bioscience, Inc., including all or a portion of the equity interests in certain of the Company s domestic and foreign subsidiaries. The Company s obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of the Company s direct, domestic wholly-owned subsidiaries none of the Company s direct or indirect foreign subsidiaries has guaranteed the Credit Facility. Issuance costs of million are amortized over the contractual term to maturity date on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest method. Total revolver borrowing capacity is limited by the consolidated net leverage ratio as defined under the amended Credit Agreement. As of the date of this report, the Company is unable to make additional borrowings under its revolving credit facility and will be unable to make any such borrowings until it delivers to the lenders its financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2024, due to net leverage ratio requirements set forth in the August 6, 2024 amendment to the Credit Agreement (the August 2024 Amendment ), as described below. 

Borrowings under the Credit Facility will, at the option of the Company, bear interest at either (i) a rate per annum based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR for an interest period of one, two, three or six months, plus an applicable interest rate margin determined as provided in the Credit Agreement (a SOFR Loan ), subject to a floor of , or (ii) an alternative base rate plus an applicable interest rate margin, each as determined as provided in the Credit Agreement (an ABR Loan ). The alternative base rate is based on the Citizens Bank prime rate or the federal funds effective rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and is subject to a floor of . Pursuant to the August 2024 Amendment, the applicable interest rate margin varies from per annum to per annum for SOFR Loans, and from per annum to per annum for ABR Loans, in each case depending on the Company s consolidated net leverage ratio, and is determined in accordance with a pricing grid set forth in the Credit Agreement, as amended. There are no prepayment penalties in the event the Company elects to prepay and terminate the Credit Facility prior to its scheduled maturity date, subject to SOFR Loan breakage and redeployment costs in certain circumstances. 

The effective interest rate on the Company s borrowings for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was and , respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was and , respectively. The weighted average interest rate as of September 30, 2024, net of the effect of the Company s interest rate swap agreement, was . The carrying value of the debt approximates fair value because the interest rate under the obligation approximates market rates of interest available to the Company for similar instruments. 

As of September 30, 2024, the term loan requires quarterly installment payments of million with a balloon payment at maturity on December 22, 2025. Furthermore, within ninety days after the end of the Company s fiscal year, the term loan may be permanently reduced pursuant to certain mandatory prepayment events including an annual excess cash flow sweep , as defined in the Credit Agreement, provided that, in any fiscal year, any voluntary prepayments of the term loan shall be credited against the Company s excess cash flow prepayment obligations on a dollar-for-dollar basis for such fiscal year. As of December 31, 2023, the current portion of long-term debt included amounts due under the excess cash flow sweep of million which was paid on March 29, 2024. Amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility can be repaid at any time but are due in full at maturity. 

The Credit Agreement includes various customary financial covenants and other affirmative and negative covenants binding on the Company. The negative covenants limit the ability of the Company, among other things, to incur debt, permit liens, make investments, sell assets, or pay dividends on its capital stock. The financial covenants include a maximum consolidated net leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio. The Credit Agreement also includes customary events of default. 

In March 2024, the Company entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement pursuant to which the Lenders and administrative agent modified the definition of Consolidated EBITDA used in the calculation of certain financial covenants to adjust for charges related to an abandoned property audit (see Note 13) and commission fees in connection with ERTC filings (see Note 5). 

In August 2024, the Company entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement that, among other things, modified the financial covenants relating to the consolidated net leverage ratio and consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio through the period ended December 31, 2024. The amendment also added a net leverage ratio requirement with respect to additional borrowing under the Company s revolving credit facility and restrictions on certain additional indebtedness and investments, in each case until the Company delivers to the Lenders the Company s financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. In addition, until delivery of such financial statements, the applicable interest rate margin is increased by bps during such time as the Company s consolidated net leverage ratio is greater than . The Company paid fees of million to the Lenders in connection with the amendment. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants of the Credit Agreement. As of the date of this report, the Company is unable to make additional borrowings under its revolving credit facility and will be unable to make any such borrowings until it delivers to the lenders its financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2024, due to net leverage ratio requirements set forth in the August 2024 Amendment. 

million as of September 30, 2024 and matures on December 22, 2025. This swap contract effectively converts the SOFR-based variable portion of the interest payable under the Credit Agreement into fixed-rate debt at an annual rate of . The swap contract does not impact the additional interest related to the applicable interest rate margin as discussed above in Note 8, Long-Term Debt. The swap contract is considered an effective cash flow hedge, and as a result, net gains or losses are reported as a component of other comprehensive income OCI in the consolidated financial statements and are reclassified when the underlying hedged interest impacts earnings. An assessment is performed quarterly to evaluate the ongoing hedge effectiveness. 

The following table presents the notional amount and fair value of the Company s derivative instruments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 

(a) See Note 10 for the fair value measurements related to these financial instruments. 

The effect of the cash flow hedge on other comprehensive income (loss) and earnings for the periods presented was as follows: 

Gain reclassified from accumulated OCI to interest expense 

Interest rate swap agreement 

The Company uses the market approach technique to value its financial liabilities. The Company s financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value include, when applicable, investments in common stock and derivative instruments used to hedge the Company s interest rate risks. The fair value of the Company s interest rate swap agreement was based on SOFR yield curves at the reporting date. The fair value of the Company s investment in HRGN common stock (see Note 6) was based on the closing price per the OTCQB Marketplace at the reporting date.

Performance-based RSU awards are contingent on the achievement of certain performance metrics. Compensation cost associated with performance-based RSUs are recognized based on the estimated number of shares that the Company ultimately expects will be earned. If the estimated number of shares to be earned is revised in the future, then stock-based compensation expense will be adjusted accordingly.

The Company s effective tax rates of ) and ) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, were different than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the mix of forecasted income or losses in the U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions and a Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income GILTI inclusion to taxable income. The effective tax rates in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, were also impacted by changes in valuation allowances associated with the Company s assessment of the likelihood of the recoverability of deferred tax assets.

Overview 

Harvard Bioscience, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is a leading developer, manufacturer and seller of technologies, products and services that enable fundamental advances in life science applications, including research, pharmaceutical and therapy discovery, bioproduction and preclinical testing for pharmaceutical and therapy development. Our products and services are sold globally to customers ranging from renowned academic institutions and government laboratories to the world s leading pharmaceutical, biotechnology and contract research organizations CROs ). With operations in the United States, Europe and China, we sell through a combination of direct and distribution channels to customers around the world. 

Trends and Developments 

Our business, results of operations, and cash flows have been impacted by macroeconomic trends affecting the life sciences industry and the global economy. These trends include inflationary and interest rate pressures, fluctuations in exchange rates, economic conditions in China, and the events in Ukraine and the Middle East. Our business has also been affected by the softening of certain international markets, especially in China and the Asia-Pacific region, as well as by delays in government funding for certain customers. Our business has also been affected by reduced demand from our biotechnology and pharmaceutical company customers, principally due to the increased cost of capital and a reduction in spending following the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect that any continuation of these trends, or any further delay in market recovery, would continue to impact our business, results of operations, and cash flows.

Revenues 

Revenues decreased 3.4 million, or 13.4 , to 22.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 25.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to continued softening of worldwide demand primarily from CRO s and academic medical research institutions. 

Gross profit 

Gross profit decreased 1.9 million, or 13.3 , to 12.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 14.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the decrease in revenues. Gross margin was 58.1 for both the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023. Gross margin was unfavorably impacted by the under-absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead costs due to the decrease in revenues which was offset by a better mix of high margin products and lower labor costs. 

Sales and marketing expenses 

Sales and marketing expenses decreased 0.2 million, or 3.7 , to 5.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 5.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

General and administrative expenses 

General and administrative expenses decreased 0.8 million, or 13.2 , to 5.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 5.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower compensation costs and increased capitalization of costs for internal-use software. 

Research and development expenses 

Research and development expenses remained relatively unchanged and decreased 0.2 million, or 7.0 , to 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Amortization of intangible assets 

Amortization of intangible assets included in operating expenses was 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Other operating expenses 

Other operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 0.2 million and included restructuring costs in connection with headcount reductions in North America and Europe. 

Interest expense 

Interest expense was 0.9 million for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, lower average borrowings were offset by increased interest rates under our Credit Facility. 

Loss on pension settlement 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we settled our obligations under one of our defined benefit plans by using plan assets to purchase non-participating annuity contracts. The settlement resulted in the recognition of a non-cash charge of 1.2 million, which has been presented as a component of other income (expense), net. This amount includes the immediate recognition of the portion of the accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI balance related to this plan. 

Gain on equity securities 

During the three months ended September 30, 2023 we recorded an unrealized gain of 1.2 million related to shares of common stock of Harvard Apparatus Regenerative Technology Inc. HRGN ). These shares were received in connection with settlement of indemnification obligations related to litigation and were all sold during the six months ended June 30, 2024. 

Income tax expense (benefit) 

The income tax expense was 0.3 million and 0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were (6.9) and (120.5) , respectively. The higher effective tax rate during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was related to a change in the mix of forecasted income and losses in the U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. The Company s effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was different than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the inclusion of non-deductible executive compensation and changes in valuation allowances associated with the Company s assessment of the likelihood of the recoverability of deferred tax assets. The Company s effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023, was different than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the mix of forecasted income or losses in the U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions and a Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income GILTI inclusion to taxable income. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023, was also impacted by changes in valuation allowances associated with the Company s assessment of the likelihood of the recoverability of deferred tax assets.

Revenues 

Revenues decreased 14.5 million, or 17.3 , to 69.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 84.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to continued softening of worldwide demand primarily from distributors, CRO s and academic medical research institutions. 

Gross profit 

Gross profit decreased 8.9 million, or 18.1 , to 40.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 49.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the decrease in revenues. Gross margin decreased to 58.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 59.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Gross margin was unfavorably impacted by a lower mix of high margin products and the under-absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead costs due to the decrease in revenues, which was partially offset by lower labor costs. 

Sales and marketing expenses 

Sales and marketing expenses decreased 1.1 million, or 6.0 , to 16.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 17.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower compensation and travel costs. 

General and administrative expenses 

General and administrative expenses decreased 0.8 million, or 4.6 , to 16.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 17.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower compensation costs and increased capitalization of costs for internal-use software. 

Research and development expenses 

Research and development expenses decreased 0.5 million, or 6.2 , to 8.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 8.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower compensation costs and higher capitalized software development costs. 

Amortization of intangible assets 

Amortization of intangible assets included in operating expenses remained relatively unchanged and was 4.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 4.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Other operating expenses 

Other operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were 1.4 million and included restructuring costs of 0.6 million in connection with headcount reductions, a fee of 0.5 million in connection with the receipt of employee retention tax credits, and 0.3 million related to settlement of an unclaimed property audit. 

Interest expense 

Interest expense decreased 0.4 million, or 15.8 , to 2.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower average borrowings during the period. 

Loss on pension settlement 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we settled our obligations under one of our defined benefit plans by using plan assets to purchase non-participating annuity contracts. The settlement resulted in the recognition of a non-cash charge of 1.2 million which has been presented as a component of other income (expense), net. This amount included the immediate recognition of the portion of the AOCI balances related to this plan. 

Loss on equity securities 

As of December 31, 2023, we held shares of common stock of HRGN with an estimated fair value of 3.5 million. These shares were received in connection with settlement of indemnification obligations related to litigation which was resolved during the year ended December 31, 2022. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold all of our HRGN shares for 1.9 million and recorded a loss on sale of 1.6 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded unrealized losses 0.4 million related to these shares. 

Income tax benefit 

The income tax expense was 0.2 million and 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were (1.4) and (9.9) , respectively. The higher effective tax rate during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was related to a change in the mix of forecasted income and losses in the U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions and changes to uncertain tax positions. The Company s effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was different than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the inclusion of non-deductible executive compensation and changes in valuation allowances associated with the Company s assessment of the likelihood of the recoverability of deferred tax assets. The Company s effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was different than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the mix of forecasted income or losses in the U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions and a GILTI inclusion to taxable income. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was also impacted by changes in valuation allowances associated with the Company s assessment of the likelihood of the recoverability of deferred tax assets.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, internally generated cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facility. Our expected cash outlays relate primarily to cash payments due under our Credit Agreement described below as well as salaries, inventory, and capital expenditures. 

We held cash and cash equivalents of 4.6 million and 4.3 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Borrowings outstanding were 38.3 million and 37.1 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

We maintain a Credit Agreement that provides for a term loan of 40.0 million and a 25.0 million revolving credit facility both maturing on December 22, 2025. On March 28, 2024, we entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement pursuant to which the Lenders and administrative agent modified the definition of Consolidated EBITDA used in the calculation of certain financial covenants to adjust for charges related to an abandoned property audit and commission fees in connection with our employee retention tax credit filings. 

On August 6, 2024, we entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement that, among other things, modified the financial covenants relating to the consolidated net leverage ratio and consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio through the period ended December 31, 2024. The amendment also added a net leverage ratio requirement with respect to additional borrowing under our revolving credit facility and restrictions on certain additional indebtedness and investments, which remains in effect until we deliver to the Lenders our financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. In addition, until delivery of such financial statements, the applicable interest rate margin is increased by 50bps during such time as the consolidated net leverage ratio is greater than 3.0. We paid fees of 0.2 million to the Lenders in connection with the amendment. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the financial covenants of the Credit Agreement (see Note 8 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1. of this report). 

As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average interest rate on our borrowings, net of the effect of the interest rate swap, was 8.6 . Total revolver borrowing capacity is limited by our consolidated net leverage ratio as defined under the Credit Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, there was no available and unused borrowing capacity under our revolving line of credit, as amended on August 6, 2024 (see Note 8 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1. of this report). 

Primarily due to a decline in revenues, we experienced a net cash outflow from operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We have substantial debt and other financial obligations. Any failure to meet these obligations or maintain compliance with the debt covenants contained in our Credit Agreement could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As of the date of this report, we are unable to make additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility and will be unable to make any such borrowings until we deliver to the lenders our financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2024, due to net leverage ratio requirements set forth in the August 2024 Amendment. 

We continue to take actions intended to improve liquidity, including actions related to cost containment and inventory reduction. Based on our current operating plans, we expect that our available cash and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to finance operations and capital expenditures and service our debt for at least the next 12 months. Our ongoing cash flows and ability to meet our debt covenants are dependent on our revenues and operating performance. If we are unable to successfully carry out our operating plans or increase our revenues, our ability to maintain compliance with our debt covenants could be adversely affected.

Cash (used in) provided by operating activities was (0.3) million and 9.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash flow from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was negatively impacted as a result of the decline in net income for the period adjusted for non-cash items and was positively impacted by the receipt of 3.2 million of employee retention tax credits. 

Cash used in investing activities was 0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and consisted of 2.8 million of capital expenditures for manufacturing and information technology infrastructure and software development, offset by 1.9 million in proceeds from the sale of marketable equity securities. Cash used in investing activities was 0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and consisted of 1.2 million of capital expenditures in manufacturing, information technology infrastructure, and software development, partially offset by 0.5 million from proceeds of the sale of our Hoefer product line. 

Cash provided by (used in) financing activities was 1.2 million and (8.0) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, debt outstanding under our credit facility increased by 1.2 million, due to net borrowings under our revolver of 6.2 million and payments of 5.0 million against the term loan. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, debt outstanding under our credit facility decreased by 8.3 million, due to net payments against our revolver of 5.0 million and payments of 3.3 million against the term loan. 

Impact of Foreign Currencies 

Our international operations in some instances operate in a natural hedge, as we sell our products in many countries and a substantial portion of our revenues, costs and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the euro and British pound. 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an insignificant effect on our revenues and expenses. 

The gain (loss) associated with the translation of our foreign equity into U.S. dollars included as a component of other comprehensive loss was 1.6 million and (1.3) million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 0.7 million and (0.4) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Currency exchange rate fluctuations included as a component of net loss resulted in losses of (0.4) million and gains of 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and losses of (0.5) million and gains of 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

There have been no material changes to the critical accounting policies underlying the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and as set forth in Part II, Item 7 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this report, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based upon management's review and evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the second quarter of fiscal 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 

In designing and evaluating our controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud within the Company have been detected.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1 Legal Proceedings. 

The information included in Note 13 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) included in Part I, Item 1 of this quarterly report is incorporated herein by reference. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

You should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, which could materially affect our business, financial position, or future results of operations. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial position, or future results of operations. The risk factor set forth below updates, and should be read together with, the risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 

Our inability to make additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility could materially affect our ability to fund our existing operations or execute our current business strategy. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding borrowings of 38.4 million under the Credit Agreement. Primarily due to a decline in revenues, we are currently unable to make additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility due to the amended net leverage ratio requirements in the Credit Agreement as amended in August 2024, and we will be unable to make any such borrowings until we deliver to the lenders our financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2024. Depending on our revenues and operating performance, our inability to make such additional borrowings could materially affect our ability to fund our existing operations or execute our current business strategy.
