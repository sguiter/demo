million at September 30, 2024, compared with million at December 31, 2023. Further, the Company had a negative working capital balance of million (excluding cash and short-term investments) at September 30, 2024 and had an accumulated deficit of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and has incurred net losses of million (excluding the effect of the gain on sale of business) and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Management expects that significant on-going operating and capital expenditures will be necessary to continue to implement the Company s business plan of entering new markets, future acquisitions, and infrastructure and product development. Historically, the Company s cash flows from operations have not been sufficient to fund its current operating model and the Company funded operations through raising equity and debt and selling assets , including the receipt of approximately million of net cash proceeds that were retained by the Company for operating matters from the sale of Board.org, see Note 4, Acquisitions and Dispositions. The Company has implemented various cost saving measures throughout 2023 and during 2024 to rationalize its cost structure and is actively evaluating additional cost saving opportunities and sources of capital. As there can be no assurance that cost saving measures and necessary financing will be available, the Company may execute other strategic alternatives to maximize stakeholder value, including further expense reductions, sale of all or portions of the business, corporate capital restructuring or formal reorganization, or liquidation of assets. As disclosed in Note 8, Debt , the Company is subject to certain financial covenants. The Company s ability to maintain compliance with these financial covenants is based on the Company s current expectations regarding revenues, collections, cost structure, current cash burn rate and other operating assumptions, which in part, depend on general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other conditions. Within one year from the date of this filing, without any actions taken by management and lenders, it is probable that the Company may not be compliant with one, or all, of its financial covenants. At the time that the Company does not maintain compliance with all of its financial covenants, the lenders may declare the amounts outstanding due and payable at which time the Company would not be able to satisfy the lenders rights. Accordingly, the Company has concluded that there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date of this filing. There can be no assurance that any necessary additional financing in the future will be available on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all. If the Company raises funds in the future by issuing equity securities, dilution to stockholders will occur and may be substantial. Any equity securities issued may also provide for rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of holders of common stock. If the Company raises funds in the future by issuing additional debt securities, these debt securities could have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of preferred and common stockholders. The terms of any additional debt securities or borrowings could impose significant restrictions on the Company s operations. The capital markets have experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, periods of upheaval that could impact the availability and cost of equity and debt financing.

operating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker CODM in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Over the past several years, the Company has completed a number of acquisitions. These acquisitions have allowed the Company to expand its offerings, presence, and reach in various market segments. While the Company has offerings in multiple market segments and operates in multiple countries, the Company s business operates in one operating segment because the Company s CODM evaluates the Company s financial information and resources, and assesses the performance of these resources, on a consolidated basis. 

of the Company s cash and cash equivalents were held at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The Company does not require collateral for accounts receivable. The Company maintains an allowance for its doubtful accounts receivable due to estimated credit losses. This allowance is based upon historical loss patterns, the number of days billings are past due, collection history of each customer, an evaluation of the potential risk of loss associated with delinquent accounts and current market conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions to inform adjustments to historical loss patterns. The Company records the allowance against bad debt expense through the condensed consolidated statements of operations, included in sales and marketing expense, up to the amount of revenues recognized to date. Any incremental allowance is recorded as an offset to deferred revenue on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Receivables are written off and charged against the recorded allowance when the Company has exhausted collection efforts without success. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , allowance for credit losses of and , respectively, was included in the accounts receivable, net balance. No single customer accounted for more than of the Company's accounts receivable balance as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Revenue derived from the U.S. Federal Government was and of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , assets located in the United States were approximately and percent of total assets, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 two vendors accounted for more than of the Company's accounts payable balance. No vendors individually accounted for more than of the Company s accounts payable as of December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , no vendor and one vendor represented more than of the total purchases made.

The modifications eliminate certain accounting models for convertible debt instruments, eliminate certain requirements for equity classification of embedded derivatives and align earnings per share calculations for convertible instruments. The Company adopted ASC 2020-06 on January 1, 2023 using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of ASC 2020-06 did not have a material impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07 Segment Reporting (Topic 280) guidance for segment reporting. The new guidance amends segment reporting to include significant segment expenses. The guidance is effective for the Company beginning with our annual report for the year ended December 31, 2024, and the subsequent interim periods and is required to be disclosed retrospectively to all prior periods presented. The Company does not expect that this guidance will have a significant impact on our disclosures. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures . The amendments in the ASU enhance income tax disclosures, primarily through standardization, disaggregation of rate reconciliation categories, and income taxes paid by jurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption allowed. We are currently evaluating the impact of adoption on our financial disclosures.

Impact of foreign currency fluctuations 

Balance at September 30, 2024 

Due to the decline in the Company s stock price and market capitalization in the first quarter of 2023, and the underperformance of the Company s ESG reporting unit compared to internal projections, the Company performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment as of March 31, 2023. This quantitative assessment resulted in all the goodwill in our ESG reporting unit being impaired; accordingly, an impairment charge of was recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2023. Prior to the quantitative goodwill impairment the Company tested the recoverability of its long-lived assets, and concluded that such assets were not impaired. The fair value estimate of the Company's reporting units was derived based on an income approach. Under the income approach, the Company estimated the fair value of reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, which the Company considers to be a Level 3 unobservable input in the fair value hierarchy. The Company prepared cash flow projections based on management's estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration the historical performance and the current macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions. The Company based the discount rate on the weighted-average cost of capital considering Company-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to our reporting unit's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. Potential indicators of impairment include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results, significant negative industry or economic trends, or a significant decline in the Company's stock price and/or market capitalization for a sustained period of time. It is reasonably possible that one or more of these impairment indicators could occur or intensify in the near term, which may result in an impairment of long-lived assets or further impairment of goodwill.

The Company accounted for the Business Combination as a reverse recapitalization whereby Old FiscalNote was determined as the accounting acquirer and DSAC as the accounting acquiree. Accordingly, the Business Combination was treated as the equivalent of Old FiscalNote issuing stock for the net assets of DSAC, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of DSAC are stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. 
 Factors Impacting the Comparability of Our Operating Results 
 Acquisitions / Disposals 
 On March 11, 2024, we completed the sale of Board.org for a total value of up to 103.0 million, consisting of 95.0 million in cash at closing and a potential earnout opportunity of up to 8.0 million. The Company recorded a gain on sale of business of 71.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024. 
 On January 27, 2023, we completed the acquisition of Dragonfly for up to 25.2 million (the "2023 Acquisition"), which included a combination of cash, stock, convertible notes and contingent payments. 
 As a result of our acquisitions, we have, and will continue to incur, significant non-cash amortization expense related to the amortization of purchased intangibles, which have reduced our operating income by approximately 0.8 million and 1.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 2.6 million and 3.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 Product rationalization 
 From time to time, management reviews the Company s existing products and services based on their financial profile and other strategic factors. In connection with such reviews, management decided to cease actively selling and therefore sunset certain non-core products, representing, in aggregate: 
 Subscription revenue of approximately 0.1 million and 0.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and approximately 0.4 million and 0.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023; and 

Non-subscription advisory revenue of approximately 1.1 million and 2.4 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

On March 11, 2024, we sold Board.org. Board.org s contributions to FiscalNote through March 11, 2024 were as follows: 
 Subscription revenue of approximately 3.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and approximately 2.8 million and 9.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023; 

Non-subscription event revenue of approximately 0.2 million and 0.5 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023; 

Run-rate revenue of approximately 15.2 million at December 31, 2023 and 14.3 million at September 30, 2023; and 

Annual Recurring Revenue ("ARR") of approximately 14.7 million at December 31, 2023 and 13.7 million at September 30, 2023. 

At the beginning of the third quarter of 2023 the Company had approximately 760 employees. In conjunction with the Company's product rationalization, business simplification, and cost takeout actions, the Company's full-time equivalent headcount reduced by approximately 175 from the beginning of the third quarter of 2023 through September 30, 2024. As a result, the Company has seen a reduction in overall costs across all operating expenses. Management will continue evaluating the Company's product portfolio for additional rationalization opportunities, both to further reduce the complexity of the business and ongoing operating expenses and to raise capital through opportunistic divestitures where appropriate. For example, as discussed in Note 18, Subsequent Events, the Company sold the Aicel business on October 31, 2024. 
 Future Growth Initiatives 
 The Company has observed slower than anticipated client decision-making on new logo sales, cross-sells and upsells, together with softer than expected renewal rates among existing clients, due to several factors including macroeconomic headwinds, competitive pressures and delays in the launch of certain product enhancements. These issues have led to slower growth in ARR, which in turn is expected to impact revenue in the coming fiscal year. In response and subject to the Company's review of strategic alternatives as previously disclosed, the Company is expecting to implement a number of actions to accelerate growth into 2025, including: 
 product enhancements and new product launches to drive improvement in user experience, client engagement and retention; 

improvements to our client success and support; and 

cross-selling and upselling opportunities at existing clients. 

Several of these initiatives require focused investment in our core product offerings and refinement of our go-to-market approach. We may continue to incur additional costs upfront to implement product enhancements, launch new products and features, obtain new customers and expand our relationships with existing customers, including additional sales and marketing expenses specific to subscription revenue. In addition, we will continue to assess opportunities to acquire complementary businesses that supplement our existing platform or enable us to enter adjacent markets. 
 Key Performance Indicators 
 In addition to our GAAP results further described and discussed below in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we monitor the following key performance indicators to evaluate growth trends, prepare financial projections, make strategic decisions, and measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts. Our management team assesses our performance based on these key performance indicators because it believes they reflect the underlying trends of our business and serve as meaningful measures of our ongoing operational performance. 
 Annual Recurring Revenue ARR 
 Approximately 90 of our revenues are subscription based. Our ability to retain existing subscription customers is a key performance indicator that helps explain the evolution of our historical results and is a leading indicator of our revenues and cash flows for subsequent periods. We use ARR as a measure of our revenue trend and an indicator of our future revenue opportunity from existing recurring subscription customer contracts. We calculate ARR on a parent account level by annualizing the contracted subscription revenue, and our total ARR as of the end of a period is the aggregate thereof. ARR is not adjusted for the impact of any known or projected future customer cancellations, upgrades or downgrades, or price increases or decreases. The amount of actual revenue that we recognize over any 12-month period is likely to differ from ARR at the beginning of that period, sometimes significantly. This may occur due to timing of the revenue bookings during the period, cancellations, upgrades, or downgrades and pending renewals. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue as it is an operating metric and is not intended to be a replacement or forecast of revenue. Our calculation of ARR may differ from similarly titled metrics presented by other companies. 
 28 

Table of Contents 

 Our ARR at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, was 109.5 million and 126.1 million, respectively. Excluding Board.org, our ARR at December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023 was 111.4 million and 109.3 million, respectively. 
 Run-Rate Revenue 
 Management also monitors Run-Rate Revenue, which we define as ARR plus non-subscription revenue earned during the last twelve months. We believe Run-Rate Revenue is an instructive indicator of our total revenue growth, incorporating the non-subscription revenue that we believe is a meaningful contribution to our business as a whole. Although our non-subscription business is non-recurring, we regularly sell different advisory services to repeat customers. The amount of actual subscription and non-subscription revenue that we recognize over any 12-month period is likely to differ from Run-Rate Revenue at the beginning of that period, sometimes significantly. Our Run-Rate Revenue at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, was approximately 119.4 million and 139.7 million, respectively. Excluding Board.org, our Run-Rate Revenue at December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023 was 124.5 million and 123.9 million, respectively. 
 Net Revenue Retention NRR 
 Our NRR, which we use to measure our success in retaining and growing recurring revenue from our existing customers, compares our recognized recurring revenue from a set of customers across comparable periods. We calculate our NRR for a given period as ARR at the end of the period minus ARR contracted from new clients for which there is no historical revenue booked during the period, divided by the beginning ARR for the period. We calculate NRR at our parent account level. Customers from acquisitions are not included in NRR until they have been part of our condensed consolidated results for 12 months. Accordingly, the 2023 and 2022 Acquisitions are not included in our NRR for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our calculation of NRR for any fiscal period includes the positive recurring revenue impacts of selling additional licenses and services to existing customers and the negative recognized recurring revenue impacts of contraction and attrition among this set of customers. Our NRR may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the level of our revenue base, the level of penetration within our customer base, expansion of products and features, the timing of renewals, and our ability to retain our customers. Our calculation of NRR may differ from similarly titled metrics presented by other companies. NRR was 99 and 100 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures to clarify and enhance our understanding, and aid in the period-to-period comparison, of our performance. Where applicable, we provide reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding most closely related GAAP measure. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to its most comparable GAAP financial measure. While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information, non-GAAP financial measures have limitations and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, their most comparable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in their financing and accounting methods, the book value of their assets, their capital structures, the method by which their assets were acquired and the manner in which they define non-GAAP measures. 
 Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin 
 We define Adjusted Gross Profit as Total revenues minus cost of revenues, including amortization of capitalized software development costs and acquired developed technology, before amortization of intangible assets that are included in costs of revenues. We define Adjusted Gross Profit Margin as Adjusted Gross Profit divided by Total revenues. 
 We use Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends. We believe these metrics are useful measures to us and to our investors to assist in evaluating our core operating performance because they provide consistency and direct comparability with our past financial performance and between fiscal periods, as the metrics eliminate the non-cash effects of amortization of intangible assets that may fluctuate for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. 
 Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. They should not be considered as replacements for gross profit and gross profit margin, as determined by GAAP, or as measures of our profitability. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using non-GAAP measures only for supplemental purposes. Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin as presented herein are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. 
 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin 
 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP financial measures. EBITDA represents earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA reflects further adjustments to EBITDA to exclude certain non-cash items and other items that management believes are not indicative of ongoing operations. We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Total revenues. 
 We disclose EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q because these non-GAAP measures are key measures used by management to evaluate our business, measure our operating performance and make strategic decisions. We believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are useful for investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as management. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are not financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as substitutes for net income (loss), net income (loss) before income taxes, or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Using these non-GAAP financial measures to analyze our business would have material limitations because the calculations are based on the subjective determination 
 29 

Table of Contents 

 of management regarding the nature and classification of events and circumstances that investors may otherwise find significant. In addition, although other companies in our industry may report measures titled EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin or similar measures, such non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently from how we calculate non-GAAP financial measures, which reduces their comparability. Because of these limitations, you should consider EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin alongside other financial performance measures, including net income and our other financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. 
 Key Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenues 
 We derive our revenues from subscription revenue arrangements and advisory, advertising and other revenues. Subscription revenues accounted for approximately 93 and 90 of our total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Subscription revenue 
 Subscription revenues consist of revenue earned from subscription-based arrangements that provide customers the right to use the Company s software and products in a cloud-based infrastructure. Subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of active licenses, the types of products and the price of the subscriptions. The Company also earns subscription revenues by licensing to customers its digital content, including transcripts, news and analysis, images, video and podcast data. 
 Our subscription arrangements generally have contractual terms of 12 months or more and are non-refundable regardless of the actual use of the service. Subscription revenues are recognized ratably over the non-cancellable contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract, which is the date our service is first made available to customers.
 
 Advisory, advertising, and other revenue 
 Advisory revenue is typically earned under contracts for specific deliverables and are non-recurring in nature, although we regularly sell different advisory services to repeat customers. One-time advisory revenues are invoiced according to the terms of the contract, usually delivered to the customer over a short period of time, during which revenues are recognized. 
 Advertising revenue is primarily generated by delivering advertising in our own publications (Roll Call and CQ) in both print and digital formats. Revenue for print advertising is recognized upon publication of the advertisement. Revenue for digital advertising is recognized over the period of the advertisement or, if the contract contains impression guarantees, based on delivered impressions. 
 Books revenue is recognized when the product is shipped to the customer, which is when control of the product transfers to the customer. Shipping and handling costs are treated as a fulfillment activity and are expensed as incurred. 
 Events revenue is deferred and only recognized when the event has taken place and is included in other revenues. 
 Cost of revenues, including amortization 
 Cost of revenues, including amortization primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service, the costs of data center capacity, amortization of developed technology and capitalized software development costs, certain fees paid to various third parties for the use of their technology, services, or data, costs of compensation, including bonuses, stock compensation, benefits and other expenses for employees associated with providing professional services and other direct costs of production. Also included in cost of revenues, including amortization are our costs related to the preparation of contracted advisory deliverables, as well as costs to develop, publish, print and deliver our publications underlying our books revenue. 
 Research and development 
 Research and development expenses include the costs of compensation, including bonuses, stock compensation, benefits and other expenses for employees associated with the creation and testing of the products we offer, related software subscriptions, consulting and contractor fees and allocated overhead. 
 Sales and marketing 
 Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including bonuses, stock compensation, benefits and other expenses for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, related software subscriptions, consulting fees, marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building and product marketing activities. 
 Editorial 
 Editorial expenses consist of salaries and related expenses, including bonuses, stock compensation, benefits and other expenses for the editorial team involved in acquiring, creating, and distributing content and allocated overhead. 
 General and administrative 
 General and administrative expenses are primarily related to our executive offices, finance and accounting, human resources, legal, internal operations and other corporate functions. These expenses consist of salaries and related expenses, including bonuses, stock compensation, benefits and other expenses, along with professional fees, depreciation and other allocated overhead.

Table of Contents 

 Amortization of intangible assets 
 Amortization expense relates to our finite-lived intangible assets, including developed technology, customer relationship, databases and tradenames. These assets are amortized over periods of between three and twenty years. Finite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment when indicators are present, and, if impaired, are written down to fair value. No impairment of intangible assets has been identified during any financial period included in our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Impairment of goodwill 
 Goodwill is tested for impairment when indicators are present, and if impaired are written down to fair value. An impairment of goodwill was identified during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and is included in our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Transaction costs, net 
 Transaction costs consist of acquisition related costs (including due diligence, accounting, legal, and other professional fees, incurred from acquisition activity), fair value adjustments to contingent consideration due to sellers, and non-capitalizable costs. 
 Interest expense, net 
 Interest expense, net, consists of expense related to interest on our borrowings, the amortization and write off of debt issuance costs and original discount, and interest related to certain derivative instruments. 
 Fair value of financial instruments 
 The fair value of warrants, debt accounted for under the fair value option, and derivative liabilities are accounted for in accordance with ASC 815, ASC 825, and ASC 480. These financial instruments are marked to market each reporting period in accordance with ASC 820 with all gains and losses being recorded within the condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss, with the exception of any gains or losses recorded due to changes in the fair value of instrument-specific credit risk being recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 Income taxes 
 We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the condensed consolidated financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. 
 The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax laws is recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. 
 Results of Operations 
 The period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations have been prepared using the historical periods included in our condensed consolidated financial statements. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with those condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 Revenue: 
 Subscription revenue 
 Subscription revenue of 27.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 2.8 million, or 9 , from 30.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Subscription revenue of 84.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 4.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The comparability of our revenues between periods was impacted by the Board.org sale and the 2023 Acquisition described under Factors Impacting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations above. The table below presents the primary items that impacted the comparability of our subscription revenues between periods.

The decrease in subscription revenue during the three and nine month periods is largely due to the impact from the sale of Board.org on March 11, 2024. This is partially offset by organic growth combined with increased revenue from the 2023 Acquisition, which was completed on January 27, 2023. 
 Advisory, advertising, and other revenue 
 Advisory, advertising, and other revenue was 2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 4.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 1.8 million, or 44 , was due largely to the discontinuation of unprofitable offerings that contributed approximately 1.1 million of revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Advisory, advertising, and other revenue was 6.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 10.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 3.6 million, or 35 , was due largely to the discontinuation of unprofitable offerings that contributed approximately 2.4 million of revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Revenues by geography are determined based on the region of the FiscalNote contracting entity, which may be different than the region of the customer. North America revenues decreased primarily for the reasons stated above. Asia revenues decreased primarily due to non-recurring revenues from 2023. Revenues outside of North America increased primarily due to our acquisition of Dragonfly on January 27, 2023 (included in Europe). 
 Cost of revenues, including amortization 
 Cost of revenues, including amortization was 6.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 10.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Historically the Company s cash flows from operations have not been sufficient to fund its current operating model and the Company funded operations through raising equity and debt. At September 30, 2024, the Company s cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments was 33.4 million compared to 24.4 million at December 31, 2023. 
 The Company had a negative working capital balance of 45.8 million (excluding cash and short-term investments) at September 30, 2024 and had an accumulated deficit of 793.5 million and 816.4 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and has incurred net losses of 48.7 million (excluding the gain on sale of business) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 64.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Management expects that significant on-going operating and capital expenditures will be necessary to continue to implement the Company s business plan of entering new markets, acquiring new businesses and technologies, and investing in infrastructure and product development. 
 Our ability to maintain our minimum cash requirement, fund our future cash interest requirements under our senior term loan and fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements will depend in part on general economic, financial, competitive, legislative,

 regulatory and other conditions that may be beyond our control. The Company has implemented various cost saving measures throughout 2023 and into 2024 and is actively seeking additional sources of capital. Volatility in the credit markets may have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain debt financing. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, or may require us to agree to unfavorable terms, and our existing stockholders may experience significant dilution. 
 Our historical financing activities included borrowings under senior secured credit facilities, senior secured promissory notes, convertible debt, and preferred share issuances. Our principal debt plus paid-in kind interest outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 consisted of the following (excluding any fair value adjustments and debt discounts, as applicable):

 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 For information regarding new accounting pronouncements, and the impact of these pronouncements on our condensed consolidated financial statements, if any, refer to Note 1 of the notes to our financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies 
 Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies to our condensed consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies and specific estimates involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. 
 There were no significant and material changes in our critical accounting policies and use of estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to those disclosed in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates and Accounting Policies" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 15, 2024. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Subscription revenues are recurring in nature and include subscription fees from customers accessing our company s cloud-based infrastructure, digital content, transcripts, news and analysis, images, video and podcast data. Advisory, advertising and other revenue includes revenues derived from non-recurring activities where we deliver specific deliverables for clients as well as where we provide advertising in our own publications (Roll Call and CQ) in both print and digital formats, the sale of various publications, and sponsorship revenue for events organized by the Company. Our company s subscription arrangements are generally non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions. Our company recognizes revenues upon the satisfaction of its performance obligation(s) (upon transfer of control of promised goods or services to its customers) in an amount that reflects the consideration to which it expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. 
 Our company s contracts with customers may include promises to transfer multiple services. For these contracts, our company accounts for individual promises separately if they are distinct performance obligations. Determining whether services are considered distinct performance obligations may require significant judgment. Judgment is also required to determine the standalone selling price SSP for each distinct performance obligation. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when our company does not sell the services separately, our company determines the SSP using available information, including market conditions and other observable inputs. 
 Costs Capitalized to Obtain Revenue Contracts 
 Costs capitalized related to new revenue contracts are amortized on a straight-line basis over four years, which, although longer than the typical initial contract period, reflects the average period of benefit, including expected contract renewals. Significant judgment is required in arriving at this average period of benefit. Therefore, we evaluate both qualitative and quantitative factors, including the estimated life cycles of our offerings and our customer attrition. 
 Business Combinations 
 Accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and pre-acquisition contingencies. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as the useful lives of those acquired intangible assets. 
 Critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired are: 
 future expected cash flows from subscription and content contracts, other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies, and trade names; 

historical and expected customer attrition rates and anticipated growth in revenue from acquired customers; 

assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name will continue to be used in our offerings; 

discount rates; 

uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances assumed; and 

fair value of earnout consideration. 

Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. 
 Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
 Significant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant reporting units for purposes of determining whether there is goodwill impairment. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations. We typically estimate the fair value of these assets 
 39 

Table of Contents 

 using the income method, which is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. The valuations used to establish and to test goodwill for impairment are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, overall growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment and margin progression, Company business plans and the discount rate applied to cash flows. 
 Goodwill is not amortized, but tested at least annually for impairment. Our ongoing annual impairment testing for goodwill occurs on October 1st. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions. For example, future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. In addition, changes to or a failure to achieve business plans or deterioration of macroeconomic conditions could result in reduced cash flows or higher discount rates, leading to a lower valuation that would trigger an impairment of the goodwill of these businesses. 
 If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, that difference represents an impairment. 
 Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. Acquired intangible assets (customer relationships, patents and technologies, and tradenames) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives. An impairment assessment for finite-lived intangibles is only required when an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. 
 The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of our reporting units are the net sales and earnings growth rates (including residual growth rates) and discount rate. The residual growth rate represents the expected rate at which the reporting units are expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period. The residual growth rate utilized in our fair value estimates is consistent with the reporting unit operating plans and approximates expected long-term market growth rates. The residual growth rate is dependent on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, and business activities that impact market share. As a result, the residual growth rate could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth or an increased competitive environment. The discount rate, which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors. 
 Future sustained depression of our stock price may indicate that a triggering event has occurred that may require us to reassess our goodwill for impairment and may trigger future impairment charges of one or all of our reporting units. Further, changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that would trigger future impairment charges of our reporting units. 
 Due to the decline in the Company s stock price and market capitalization in the first quarter of 2023, and the underperformance of the Company s ESG reporting unit compared to internal projections, the Company performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment as of March 31, 2023. This quantitative assessment resulted in all the goodwill in our ESG reporting unit being impaired; accordingly, a non-cash impairment charge of 5.8 million was recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2023. Prior to the quantitative goodwill impairment the Company tested the recoverability of its long-lived assets, and concluded that such assets were not impaired. 
 See Note 7, Goodwill to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on goodwill. 
 Warrant Liabilities 
 The Company evaluates its financial instruments, including its outstanding warrants, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. The Company has outstanding public and private warrants, both of which do not meet the criteria for equity classification and are accounted for as liabilities. Accordingly, the Company recognizes the warrants as liabilities at fair value and adjusts the warrants to fair value at each reporting period. The warrant liabilities are subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until exercised, and any change in fair value is recognized in the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations. 
 The fair value of the public warrants is estimated based on the quoted market price of such warrants. The fair value of the private warrants is estimated using a binomial option pricing model. 
 Debt instruments measured at fair value 
 The Company accounts for certain of its debt obligations at fair value. Accordingly, the Company recognizes the debt obligations upon inception at fair value. The debt obligations are subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date, and any change in fair value is recognized in the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations. The Company estimates the fair value of the debt obligation using a lattice model. 
 Deferred Taxes and Valuation Allowance 
 Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. We regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. 
 40 

Table of Contents 

 Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute its business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, the tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. 
 Incremental Borrowing Rate Used to Calculate Lease Balances 
 A s most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate to measure the operating lease assets and liabilities. The incremental borrowing rate represents an estimate of the interest rate we would incur at lease commencement to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over the term of the lease and includes considerations of both the market, our current capital structure and exiting debt borrowings. We perform an incremental borrowing rate analysis on a quarterly basis, or upon execution of any individually material agreement, to ensure that the rates being applied to newly acquired leases are still accurate.

 Item 3. Q uantitative and Quali tative Disclosures About Market Risks. 
 We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily consist of inflation risk and fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 We use the U.S. Dollar ("USD") as our reporting currency. Our local subsidiaries transact generally in their local currency, considered the functional currency for that subsidiary. Our foreign currency exchange rate risk is related to translation of our assets and liabilities from the subsidiaries' functional currencies to USD. These adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on our consolidated balance sheets. Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro, British Pound Sterling and Australian Dollar. Our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our operations, which are primarily in the United States as well as the European Union, United Kingdom, Australia, South Korea, and India. Our results of operations and cash flows in the future may be adversely affected due to an expansion of non-U.S. dollar denominated contracts, growth of our international entities and changes in foreign exchange rates. The effect of a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our business would not have a material impact on our cash denominated in foreign currency. To date, we have not engaged in any hedging strategies. As our international operations grow, we will continue to reassess our approach to manage the risk relating to fluctuations in currency rates. 
 Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets, liabilities, revenues, operating expenses and cash flows that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into USD. Total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was impacted by approximately 1.0 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are subject to market risk associated with changing interest rates within our variable rate Senior Term Loan. Our exposure to changes in interest rates is associated with the Prime Rate. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding borrowings on our Senior Term Loan of 93.4 million, which bear cash interest at a floating rate based on the Prime Rate plus an applicable margin. At September 30, 2024, the interest rate on our Senior Term Loan was 13.0 . Assuming no change in the outstanding borrowings on our Senior Term Loan, we estimate that a one percentage point increase in the Prime Rate would increase our annual cash interest expense by approximately 0.9 million. 
 Inflation Risk 
 Although we do not believe inflation has had a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our business. 
 Ite m 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of the disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting and has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of September 30, 2024. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with general accepted accounting principles. Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Update on Remediation of Previously Reported Material Weaknesses 
 Management identified three material weaknesses in internal controls in the areas of (i) information technology general controls related to administrative user access to the Company s information systems that are relevant to the preparation of the financial statements to ensure appropriate segregation of duties and to adequately restrict access to financial applications and data; and user access provisioning and monitoring; (ii) Ineffective controls over the accounting for fair market value changes to financial instruments; and (iii) ineffective controls over the accounting for stock compensation accounting. Management is taking steps to successfully remediate these material weaknesses by implementing remediation efforts described below. 
 Management is committed to the remediation of the material weaknesses described above, as well as the continued improvement of our internal control over financial reporting. Our efforts resulting in successful remediation include:

Table of Contents 

 1. Administrator access to financially relevant systems has been restricted to relevant system owners 

2. Enhanced design of access reviews performed across each financially relevant system 

3. Additional review procedures involving fair market value changes to financial instruments 

4. Additional review procedures surrounding the accounting for stock compensation. 

Notwithstanding the assessment that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective and that material weaknesses exist, we believe we have employed supplementary procedures to ensure the financial statements contained in this report fairly present in all material respects, our financial position as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Other than the material weaknesses identified in prior year and material weakness remediation activities, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

If the Company receives a Notice of Conversion from the Holder at a time when the actual number of outstanding shares of Common Stock is less than the Reported Outstanding Share Number, the Company shall notify the Holder in writing of the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding and, to the extent that such Notice of Conversion would otherwise cause the Holder s beneficial ownership, as determined pursuant to this Section 3(f) , to exceed the Maximum Percentage, the Holder shall notify the Company of a reduced number of shares of Common Stock to be purchased pursuant to such Notice of Conversion. For any reason at any time, upon the written or oral request of the Holder, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (within one VWAP Trading Day) confirm, orally and in writing or by electronic mail to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding. In the event that the issuance of shares of Common Stock to the Holder upon conversion of this Note would result in the Holder and the other Attribution Parties being deemed to beneficially own, in the aggregate, more than the Maximum Percentage of the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock (as determined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act), the Holder shall notify the Company in writing to reduce the number of shares so issued by which the Holder s and the other Attribution Parties aggregate beneficial ownership would exceed the Maximum Percentage (the Excess Shares and the issuance of such Excess Shares shall be deemed null and void and shall be cancelled ab initio and any portion of this Note so converted will be reinstated, and the Holder shall not have the power to vote or to transfer the Excess Shares. Upon delivery of a written notice to the Company, the Holder may from time to time increase or decrease the Maximum Percentage to any other percentage not in excess of 9.99 as specified in such notice; provided that (x) any such increase in the Maximum Percentage will not be effective until the 61st day after such notice is delivered to the Company and (y) any such increase or decrease will apply only to the Holder and the other Attribution Parties. For purposes of clarity, it is the intent of the Company and the Holder that the shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to the terms of this Note in excess of the Maximum Percentage shall not be deemed to be beneficially owned by the Holder for any purpose including for purposes of Section 13(d) or Rule 16a-1(a)(1) of the Exchange Act. The provisions of this Section 3(f) shall be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms of this Section 3(f) to the extent necessary to correct this Section 3(f) (or any portion of this Section 3(f) that may be defective or inconsistent with the intended beneficial ownership limitation contained in this Section 3(f) or to make changes or 
 10 DOCPROPERTY CUS_DocIDChunk0 99401006.8 

supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation. The limitation contained in this Section 3(f) may not be waived and shall apply to a successor holder of this Note. 
 (g)	 Share Cap Limit.

 Section 4. Certain Adjustments . The Conversion Rate shall be automatically increased by 10 percentage points if, following the Initial Conversion Date, the Company fails to timely file any document or report that the Company is required to file under the Exchange Act to remain current in its public reporting pursuant to Rule 144(i) under the Securities Act (such failure, a Filing Failure ). The Conversion Rate shall be automatically increased by an additional 10 percentage points for each 30 calendar day period in which such Filing Failure is not cured. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the Conversion Rate be increased by more than 30 percentage points.

 Subject to the terms of this Agreement, all fees and expenses of the Indemnified Party (including reasonable fees and expenses to the extent incurred in connection with investigating or preparing to defend such Proceeding in a manner not inconsistent with this Section 5 shall be paid to the Indemnified Party, as incurred, within twenty (20) Trading Days of written notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party; provided , that the Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for that portion of such fees and expenses applicable to such actions for which such Indemnified Party is finally judicially determined to not be entitled to indemnification hereunder. The failure to deliver written notice to the Indemnifying Party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action shall not relieve such Indemnifying Party of any liability to the Indemnified Party under this Section 5 , except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially and adversely prejudiced in its ability to defend such action. 
 (d) Contribution . If a claim for indemnification under Section 5(a) or (b) is unavailable to an Indemnified Party or insufficient to hold an Indemnified Party harmless for any Losses, then 

13 DOCPROPERTY CUS_DocIDChunk0 99403809.7 

each Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such Losses, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party in connection with the actions, statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission of a material fact, has been taken or made by, or relates to information supplied by, such Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party, and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action, statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of any Losses shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, any reasonable attorneys or other reasonable fees or expenses incurred by such party in connection with any Proceeding to the extent such party would have been indemnified for such fees or expenses if the indemnification provided for in this Section 5 was available to such party in accordance with its terms. 

The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 5(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5(d) , (A) no Holder shall be required to contribute, in the aggregate, any amount in excess of the amount by which the gross proceeds actually received by such Holder from the sale of the Registrable Securities subject to the Proceeding exceeds the amount of any damages that such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission and (B) no contribution will be made under circumstances where the maker of such contribution would not have been required to indemnify the Indemnified Party under the fault standards set forth in this Section 5 . No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 
 The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 5 are in addition to any liability that the Indemnifying Parties may have to the Indemnified Parties and are not in diminution or limitation of the indemnification provisions under the Purchase Agreement.

 We are registering shares of Class A Common Stock to permit the resale of these shares of Class A Common Stock by the selling stockholder from time to time after the date of this prospectus. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale by the selling stockholder of the shares of Class A Common Stock. We will, or will procure to, bear all fees and expenses incident to our obligation to register the shares of Class A Common Stock. 
 The selling stockholder may sell all or a portion of the shares of Class A Common Stock beneficially owned by it and offered hereby from time to time directly or through one or more underwriters, broker-dealers or agents. If the shares of Class A Common Stock are sold through underwriters, the selling stockholder will be responsible for underwriting discounts. If the shares of Class A Common Stock are sold through broker-dealers, we have agreed to reimburse the selling stockholder for commissions or agent s commissions or pay such commissions or agent s commissions directly. The shares of Class A Common Stock may be sold on any national securities exchange or quotation service on which the securities may be listed or quoted at the time of sale, in the over-the-counter market or in transactions otherwise than on these exchanges or systems or in the over-the-counter market and in one or more transactions at fixed prices, at prevailing market prices at the time of the sale, at varying prices determined at the time of sale, or at negotiated prices. These sales may be effected in transactions, which may involve crosses or block transactions. The selling stockholder may use any one or more of the following methods when selling shares: 

ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker-dealer solicits purchasers; 

block trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the shares as agent but may position and resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction; 

purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for its account; 

an over-the-counter distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange;

The selling stockholder also may resell all or a portion of the shares of Class A Common Stock in open market transactions in reliance upon Rule 144 under the Securities Act as permitted by that rule, or Section 4(a)(1) under the Securities Act, if available, rather than under this prospectus, provided that they meet the criteria and conform to the requirements of those provisions. 
 2 DOCPROPERTY CUS_DocIDChunk0 99403809.7 

Broker-dealers engaged by the selling stockholder may arrange for other broker-dealers to participate in sales.

 The selling stockholder and any broker-dealer or agents participating in the distribution of the shares of Class A Common Stock may be deemed to be underwriters within the meaning of Section 2(11) of the Securities Act in connection with such sales. In such event, any commissions paid, or any discounts or concessions allowed to, any such broker-dealer or agent and any profit on the resale of the shares purchased by them may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the Securities Act. Any selling stockholder who is an underwriter within the meaning of Section 2(11) of the Securities Act will be subject to the applicable prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act including Rule 172 thereunder and may be subject to certain statutory liabilities of, including but not limited to, Sections 11, 12 and 17 of the Securities Act and Rule 10b-5 under the Exchange Act. 
 The selling stockholder has informed the Company that it is not a registered broker-dealer and does not have any written or oral agreement or understanding, directly or indirectly, with any person to distribute the shares of Class A Common Stock. Upon the Company being notified in writing by the selling stockholder that any material arrangement has been entered into with a 
 3 DOCPROPERTY CUS_DocIDChunk0 99403809.7 

broker-dealer for the sale of the Class A Common Stock through a block trade, special offering, exchange distribution or secondary distribution or a purchase by a broker or dealer, a supplement to this prospectus will be filed, if required, pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act, disclosing (i) the name of the selling stockholder and of the participating broker-dealer(s), (ii) the number of shares involved, (iii) the price at which such shares of Class A Common Stock were sold, (iv) the commissions paid or discounts or concessions allowed to such broker-dealer(s), where applicable, (v) that such broker-dealer(s) did not conduct any investigation to verify the information set out or incorporated by reference in this prospectus, and (vi) other facts material to the transaction. In no event shall any broker-dealer receive fees, commissions and markups, which, in the aggregate, would exceed eight percent (8.0 ). 
 Under the securities laws of some U.S. states, the shares of Class A Common Stock may be sold in such states only through registered or licensed brokers or dealers. In addition, in some U.S. states the shares of Class A Common Stock may not be sold unless such shares have been registered or qualified for sale in such state or an exemption from registration or qualification is available and is complied with. 
 There can be no assurance that the selling stockholder will sell any or all of the shares of Class A Common Stock registered pursuant to the registration statement, of which this prospectus forms a part. 
 The selling stockholder and any other person participating in such distribution will be subject to applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, including, without limitation, to the extent applicable, Regulation M of the Exchange Act, which may limit the timing of purchases and sales of any of the shares of Class A Common Stock by the selling stockholder and any other participating person. To the extent applicable, Regulation M may also restrict the ability of any person engaged in the distribution of the shares of Class A Common Stock to engage in market-making activities with respect to the Class A Common Stock. All of the foregoing may affect the marketability of the Class A Common Stock and the ability of any person or entity to engage in market-making activities with respect to the shares of Class A Common Stock. 
 In addition, we will make copies of this prospectus available to the selling stockholder for the purpose of satisfying the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act. The selling stockholder may indemnify any broker-dealer that participates in transactions involving the sale of the shares against certain liabilities, including liabilities arising under the Securities Act. 
 We will pay all expenses of the registration of the shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, including, without limitation, SEC filing fees and expenses of compliance with state securities or blue sky laws; provided , however , that the selling stockholder will pay all underwriting discounts, if any, and any related legal expenses incurred by it; provided , further we have agreed to reimburse the selling stockholder for commissions or agent s commissions or pay such commissions or agent s commissions directly.

will be entitled to contribution. We may be indemnified by the selling stockholder against civil liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, that may arise from any written information furnished to us by the selling stockholder specifically for use in this prospectus, in accordance with the related Registration Rights Agreement, or we may be entitled to contribution.
