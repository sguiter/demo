million and an accumulated deficit of million. Based upon the Company's current operating plans, the Company believes that its existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund its operations for at least the next 12 months following the issuance date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The Company will need to raise additional capital to continue the advancement of its programs. In the near term, the Company's primary uses of cash will be to fund the completion of key milestones for clinical programs and to fund its operations, including research and development activities and employee salaries. This includes significant costs relating to clinical trials and manufacture of the Company's product candidates. The Company's uses of cash in the long term will be similar as the Company advances its research and development activities and pays employee salaries. Most pharmaceutical products require larger clinical trials as development progresses, and the Company expects its funding requirements to grow with the advancement of its programs. The Company's long-term funding requirements will depend on many factors, which are uncertain but include its portfolio prioritization decisions and the success of its collaborations. In turn, the Company's ability to raise additional capital through equity or partnering will depend on the general economic environment in which it operates and its ability to achieve key milestones.

t active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 U bservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires management to make judgments and consider factors specific to the asset or liability. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, financial assets measured on a recurring basis consist of cash invested in money market accounts, short-term investments, and long-term investments. The fair value of short- and long-term investments is based upon market prices quoted on the last day of the fiscal period or other observable market inputs. The Company obtains pricing information from its investment manager and generally determines the fair value of investment securities using standard observable inputs, including reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, bids and/or offers. There were no transfers in or out of Level 3 fair value measurements during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Collaboration revenue is recognized over time proportionate to the costs that the Company has incurred to perform the services using an input method as a measure of progress towards satisfying the performance obligation, which is based on project hours. Amounts are billed based on estimated variable consideration in the quarter ahead of performance and are trued up on the subsequent quarter s invoice following the work performed. The cumulative effect of revisions to estimated hours to complete the Company s performance obligation will be recorded in the period in which changes are identified and amounts can be reasonably estimated. As of September 30, 2024, receivables of related to research and development services performed under the Toray Agreement were recorded as part of the prepaid expenses and other current assets line item on the Company's condensed balance sheet. There were receivables as of December 31, 2023.

Balance at September 30, 2024 

The Company recorded million and million revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, and in the same periods in 2023. The Toray Agreement includes both fixed and variable considerations. Under the Toray Agreement, the Company will be compensated for early-stage development and manufacturing activities based on agreed full-time equivalent rates and actual out-of-pocket costs incurred through the completion of the first Phase 1 clinical trial for the lead product candidate and Toray is entitled to reimbursement for 50 of such development costs from the Company s share of revenues collected from the sale or licensing of collaboration products. Although the legal term of the agreement is until collaboration products are no longer sold in the territories covered under the agreement, the parties have present enforceable rights and obligations through the end of the first Phase 1 clinical trial, after which both parties can opt out of continued development under the agreement. As such, the accounting term of the Toray Agreement was considered to terminate upon completion of the first Phase 1 clinical trial. After the conclusion of the first Phase 1 clinical trial, the parties will share equally all costs of development activities necessary for obtaining regulatory approval of collaboration products in the indications in the territories covered under the agreement, unless either party elects to opt out of its co-funding obligations or reduce them by half, which election can be on a region-by-region basis or for the territories covered under the agreement as a whole. Such optional additional items will be accounted for as contract modifications when development advances past certain milestones and the parties both exercise their opt-in rights. Oncology Research and Development Collaboration with Genmab A/S In May 2021, the Company entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement (the Genmab Agreement with Genmab A/S Genmab ). Together, the companies will evaluate Genmab antibodies and bispecific antibody engineering technologies in combination with the Company s Boltbody ISAC technology platform, with the goal of discovering and developing next-generation bispecific ISACs for the treatment of cancer. Under this research collaboration, the companies will evaluate multiple bispecific ISAC concepts to identify up to three clinical candidates for development. Genmab will fund the research, along with the preclinical and clinical development of these candidates through initial clinical proof of concept. Under the Genmab Agreement, the Company received an upfront payment of million. The Company has determined that the Genmab Agreement is a contract with a customer and should be accounted for under ASC 606. In conjunction with the Genmab Agreement, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement (the Genmab SPA for the issuance of shares of the Company s common stock to Genmab for a total purchase price of million. These contracts have been evaluated together and the consideration in excess of the fair value of the common stock of million has been allocated to the Genmab Agreement and included in the total consideration for collaboration revenue. 

 12 

million upfront payment, the million allocated from the Genmab SPA, and million of estimated variable consideration related to compensation for research and development services at the agreed upon full-time employee rate and third-party costs. Collaboration revenue is recognized over time proportionate to the costs that the Company has incurred to perform the services using an input method as a measure of progress towards satisfying the performance obligation, which is based on project hours. Compensation for the research and development services are billed in the quarter based on actual hours incurred to satisfy the performance obligation. The cumulative effect of revisions to estimated hours to complete the Company s performance obligation will be recorded in the period in which changes are identified and amounts can be reasonably estimated. As of September 30, 2024 and as of December 31, 2023, receivables of million and million, respectively, related to research and development services performed under the Genmab Agreement were recorded as part of the prepaid expenses and other current assets line item on the Company's condensed balance sheet. Deferred revenue allocated to the unsatisfied performance obligation is recorded as a contract liability on the Company's condensed balance sheet and will be recognized over time as the services are performed. As of September 30, 2024, contract liabilities totaling million were recorded in deferred revenue with million in current liabilities and million in non-current liabilities on the Company's condensed balance sheet based on the forecasted periods of per formance. As of December 31, 2023 , contract liabilities totaling million were recorded in deferred revenue with million in current liabilities and million in non-current liabilities on the balance sheet based on the forecasted periods of performance.

Revenue recognized 

() 

Balance at September 30, 2024 

The Company recorded million and million in revenue earned during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and million and million in the same periods in 2023 , respectively, based on services performed under the Genmab Agreement during the period. Under the Genmab Agreement, the Company will be compensated for research and development services at the agreed upon full-time employee rate and third-party costs through initial clinical proof of concept of the therapeutic candidates, which also represents the period of time both parties have enforceable rights and obligations. As such, the accounting term of the Genmab Agreement was considered to terminate upon completion of the initial clinical proof of concept of the therapeutic candidates, after which Genmab has the option to develop and commercialize up to three therapeutic candidates and the Company has the option to participate in development and commercialization of one candidate. The Genmab Agreement includes optional additional items which will be accounted for as contract modifications after initial clinical proof of concept of the therapeutic candidates. With respect to each candidate for which a party has exercised its program opt-in rights and has exclusive global rights, the other party is eligible to receive potential development and sales-based milestone payments and tiered royalties, subject to certain customary reductions, the amount of all such considerations will vary based on the market potential of the applicable territory for which such party has exercised its program opt-in rights. Under the Genmab Agreement, the Company is eligible to receive total potential milestone payments of up to million in development milestones and million in sale milestones per therapeutic candidate exclusively developed and commercialized by Genmab, along with tiered royalties at rates from a single-digit to mid-teens percentage based on net sales of each therapeutic candidate. However, given the current phase of development of therapeutic candidates under the Genmab Agreement, the Company cannot estimate the probability or timing of achieving these milestones, and, therefore, has excluded all milestone and royalty payments from the transaction prices of the agreement. Oncology Research and Development Collaboration with Innovent Biologics, Inc. In March 2024, the Company entered into an amended and restated license and collaboration agreement with Innovent Biologics, Inc. (the Amended Innovent Agreement ), which amends the original license and collaboration agreement with Innovent Biologics, Inc. ("Innovent") dated August 25, 2021 (the Original Innovent Agreement ). Under the Original Innovent Agreement, the Company and Innovent leveraged Innovent s proprietary therapeutic antibody portfolio and antibody discovery capability against undisclosed oncology targets in combination with the Company's Boltbody ISAC technology and myeloid biology expertise to create new candidates for cancer treatments. Innovent funded the initial research, along with the preclinical development of these candidates through the contract modification date. Under the Original Innovent Agreement, the Company received an upfront payment of million and was compensated for research and development services at the agreed upon full-time employee rate and third-party costs. As part of the Amended Innovent Agreement, Innovent paid the Company a one-time payment of million to be relieved from certain future funding and developmental obligations under the Original Innovent Agreement. Additionally, the Company secured exclusive worldwide rights to ISAC programs utilizing specified antibodies against two tumor antigen targets and assumed all future development and commercialization costs for any such ISAC program. Under the Amended Innovent Agreement, the Company 

 13 

million, as well as royalties in low single digits on global net sales. The Company determined that the Amended Innovent Agreement no longer meets the criteria under ASC 606. Therefore, million of deferred revenue allocated to the unsatisfied performance obligation as of the contract modification date, was recognized as revenue and the million one-time payment received was recognized as other income on the condensed statement of operations and comprehensive loss in the first quarter of 2024.

Oncology Clinical Trial Collaboration and Supply Agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb In September 2021, the Company entered into a clinical collaboration and supply agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company BMS to study trastuzumab imbotolimod in combination with BMS s PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab, for the treatment of HER2-expressing solid tumors (the BMS Agreement ). Under the BMS Agreement, BMS granted the Company a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license (with a right to sublicense) under its intellectual property to use nivolumab in a clinical trial for a combination therapy of nivolumab and trastuzumab imbotolimod, formerly known as BDC-1001. On May 14, 2024, the Company announced a strategic pipeline prioritization and restructuring plan pursuant to which it will discontinue developing trastuzumab imbotolimod, which includes the clinical trial for a combination therapy of nivolumab and trastuzumab imbotolimod.

As of September 30, 2024 , the Company did t incur any nor have any milestone payments probable under the Amended Supply Agreement. Guarantees and Indemnifications In the normal course of business, the Company enters into agreements that contain a variety of representations and provide for general indemnification. The Company s exposure under these agreements is unknown because it involves claims that may be made against the Company in the future. To date, the Company has not paid any claims or been required to defend any action related to its indemnification obligations. As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible and, consequently, had not recorded related liabilities. Other Commitments The Company enters into agreements in the normal course of business, including with contract research organizations for clinical trials, contract manufacturing organizations for certain manufacturing services, and vendors for preclinical studies and other services and products for operating purposes, which are generally cancelable upon written notice. Legal Proceedings From time to time, we might be subject to various legal proceedings relating to claims arising out of our operations. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against us in a reporting period for amounts above management s expectations, our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Except as described below, we are not currently involved in any material legal proceedings, the ultimate disposition of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition or cash flows. Securities Class Action On July 2, 2024, a securities class action complaint was filed against the Company and certain of its directors and executive officers (collectively, the "Defendants") in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned Nesterenko v. Bolt Biotherapeutics, Inc. et al. , Case No. 3:24-cv-03985 , purportedly on behalf of a class of individuals who purchased or otherwise acquired the Company s common stock between February 5, 2021 and May 14, 2024.

In addition, the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2021 Plan automatically increases on the first day of January of each calendar year that commences after the 2021 Plan became effective and continuing through and including January 1, 2031, in an amount equal to of the total number of shares of the Company s common stock outstanding on December 31, or a lesser number of shares determined by the Company's board of directors or compensation committee. As a result, common stock reserved for issuance under the 2021 Plan was increased by shares on January 1, 2024. In connection with the workforce reduction described in Note 7 Restructuring , the Company entered into consulting agreements with certain officers of the Company, pursuant to which a total of stock options previously granted to the officers were canceled on July 15, 2024. In addition, in January 2021, the Company s board of directors and stockholders adopted the 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP ). The ESPP authorized issuance of up to shares of common stock and it became effective upon the execution of the underwriting agreement for the Company s IPO. The 2021 ESPP permits participants to purchase common stock through payroll deductions of up to of their eligible compensation. Employees purchase shares of common stock at a price per share equal to of the lower of the fair market value at the start or end of six-month purchase periods within the offering period. In addition, the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2021 ESPP automatically increases on January 1 of each calendar year that commences after the ESPP became effective and continuing through and including January 1, 2031, by the lesser of (1) of the total number of shares of the Company's common stock outstanding on December 31 of the preceding calendar year, (2) shares, and (3) a number of shares determined by the Company's board of directors.

 Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer. Our pipeline candidates are built on our deep expertise in myeloid biology and cancer drug development. Our various approaches use pattern recognition receptors expressed by the innate immune system to help the body eliminate tumor cells as part of a productive anti-cancer response. Our proprietary Boltbody ISAC platform technology combines tumor-targeting antibodies with immune-stimulating linker-payloads. We believe this approach has the potential to create products that work with a patient s own immune system, resulting in anti-cancer efficacy good tolerability. Having explored more than one hundred distinct linker-payloads and multiple tumor targets, we know the importance of both the linker-payload and the antibody and have developed a library of linker-payloads for use in our own development programs and in our collaborations. 
 BDC-3042, our Dectin-2 agonist antibody program, is being developed to repolarize critical cells in the tumor microenvironment known as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Dectin-2 agonism changes these TAMs from tumor-supportive macrophages to tumor-destructive macrophages that elicit durable anti-tumor immune responses in preclinical models. We received the Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, clearance from the FDA in July 2023. In October 2023, we dosed the first patient with BDC-3042 in the Phase 1 dose-escalation study in patients with a broad range of solid tumors. BDC-3042 has now completed the first six dose escalation cohorts without experiencing a dose-limiting toxicity. 
 We recently selected BDC-4182 as our next clinical candidate. BDC-4182 utilizes our next-generation Boltbody ISAC technology and targets the Claudin 18.2 tumor associated antigen. Claudin 18.2 is a clinically validated target in oncology with zolbetuximab, a first-in-class Claudin 18.2-targeted monoclonal antibody, receiving commercial approval in Japan in March 2024 for patients with Claudin 18.2-positive, unresectable, advanced or recurrent gastric cancer. Other programs targeting Claudin 18.2 are in development for the treatment of gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancer, pancreatic cancer, and other tumor types. BDC-4182 is currently in IND-enabling activities. Clinical candidate selection was supported by in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrating potent anti-tumor activity in multiple preclinical models, safety and tolerability in a non-GLP non-human primate toxicology study, and enhanced preclinical efficacy compared to cytotoxic ADCs in murine tumor models. Data on our Claudin 18.2 Boltbody ISAC program was presented at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer s (SITC) 2023 Annual Meeting in October. We expect to initiate our first in human clinical trial in 2025. 
 On May 14, 2024, we announced a strategic pipeline prioritization and restructuring plan pursuant to which we will discontinue developing trastuzumab imbotolimod, formerly known as BDC-1001, in order to focus on our Phase 1 asset, BDC-3042, and our next generation Boltbody ISAC platform including new clinical candidate BDC-4182, targeting Claudin 18.2 and reduce overall operating expenses. The restructuring plan reduced our workforce by approximately 50 employees, or approximately 50 of our workforce. We estimate the total restructuring charges amounting to 3.6 million, which consist of 2.9 million of one-time termination benefits such as severance costs and related benefits and 0.7 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense. The severance payments commenced in July 2024 and will extend through July 2025. 
 Since our inception in January 2015, we have focused primarily on organizing and staffing our company, business planning, licensing, developing intellectual property, raising capital, developing our product candidates, and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials. Prior to the completion of our initial public offering in February 2021, we funded our operations primarily through private placements of our convertible preferred stock for gross proceeds of 173.7 million. In February 2021, we completed our initial public offering of 13,225,000 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of 20.00 per share, including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase 1,725,000 additional shares of our common stock. Including the option exercise, the aggregate net proceeds to us from the offering was approximately 242.0 million, net of underwriting discounts, commissions, and other offering expenses. In May 2021, we issued 821,045 shares of our common stock to Genmab for gross proceeds of approximately 15.0 million. 
 21 

We have not recorded any revenue from product sales. To date, our only revenue has been derived from our collaborations with Toray, Genmab, and Innovent. In March 2019, we entered into the Toray Agreement to jointly develop and commercialize a Boltbody ISAC utilizing a Toray proprietary antibody. In May 2021, we entered into an oncology research and development collaboration with Genmab to evaluate Genmab antibodies and bispecific antibody engineering technologies in combination with our proprietary Boltbody ISAC technology platform, with the goal of discovering and developing next-generation bispecific ISACs for the treatment of cancer. The research collaboration will evaluate multiple bispecific ISAC product candidate concepts with the potential to identify up to three clinical candidates for development. In August 2021, we entered into an oncology research and development collaboration with Innovent to leverage Innovent s proprietary therapeutic antibody portfolio and antibody discovery capability against undisclosed oncology targets in combination with our Boltbody ISAC technology and myeloid biology expertise to create new candidates for cancer treatments. The Innovent collaboration was amended in March 2024, when we secured exclusive worldwide rights to ISAC programs utilizing specified antibodies against two tumor antigen targets. We expect our collaborations with Toray and Genmab to add additional novel ISACs to our pipeline. 
 We have incurred operating losses since our inception. Our net losses were 15.2 million and 47.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 16.3 million and 51.3 million for the same periods in 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 411.5 million. Substantially all of our net losses have resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from general and administrative and restructuring costs associated with our operations. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we: 
 conduct our ongoing and planned clinical trials; 

continue our research and development programs; 

continue our clinical, regulatory, quality and manufacturing capabilities; 

seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates; and 

operate as a public company. 

Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending on the timing of our planned clinical trials and preclinical studies, and our expenditures on other research and development activities. 
 Business Conditions and Macroeconomic Factors 
 Macroeconomic factors, such as increased inflation and interest rates, financial and credit market fluctuations, changes in economic policy, global supply chain constraints, and recent and potential disruptions in access to bank deposits due to bank failures, have had, and we believe will continue to have, an impact on our business and results of operations. Similar, and perhaps more severe, disruptions in our operations could negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 The effects of a pandemic or major geopolitical developments, and associated economic conditions, remain difficult to predict due to numerous uncertainties. We believe that the direct and indirect impacts of these business conditions and macroeconomic factors are difficult to isolate or quantify. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors below and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 21, 2024, and the Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for additional details. We will continue to closely monitor and evaluate the nature and extent of these macroeconomic factors on our business, consolidated results of operations, and financial condition. 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 To date our only revenue has been collaboration revenue derived from our collaborations with Toray, Genmab, and Innovent. We are collaborating with Toray to develop a Boltbody ISAC that incorporates a proprietary Toray antibody against a novel tumor antigen target. We are jointly responsible for early-stage development and for providing technical and regulatory support, and Toray will pay for the program expenses through the end of Phase 1 development. In conjunction with the collaboration, Toray purchased 717,514 shares of our Series T convertible preferred stock for 10.0 million, which were converted into shares of our common stock upon the completion of our IPO in February 2021. We evaluated the collaboration together with Toray s purchase of Series T convertible preferred stock and allocated 1.5 million from the stock purchase proceeds to deferred revenue, which we recognize, together with payments received from Toray as compensation based on agreed-upon full-time equivalent rates and out-of-pocket costs, as collaboration revenue over time as we fulfill our performance obligation to Toray. 
 22 

In May 2021, we entered into an oncology research and development collaboration with Genmab to evaluate Genmab antibodies and bispecific antibody engineering technologies in combination with our proprietary Boltbody ISAC technology platform, with the goal of discovering and developing next-generation bispecific ISACs for the treatment of cancer. The research collaboration will evaluate multiple bispecific ISAC concepts to identify up to three clinical candidates for development. Genmab will fund the research, along with the preclinical and clinical development of these candidates through initial clinical proof of concept. Under the Genmab Agreement, we received an upfront payment of 10.0 million and in conjunction with the collaboration, Genmab purchased 821,045 shares of our common stock for 15.0 million. We evaluated the collaboration together with Genmab s purchase of our common stock and allocated 1.4 million from the stock purchase proceeds, together with the 10.0 million upfront payment, to deferred revenue. We recognize this deferred revenue, together with payments received from Genmab for compensation based on agreed-upon full-time equivalent rates and out-of-pocket costs, as collaboration revenue over time as we fulfill our performance obligation to Genmab. 
 In August 2021, we entered into an oncology research and development collaboration with Innovent, or the Original Innovent Agreement, to leverage Innovent s proprietary therapeutic antibody portfolio and antibody discovery capability against undisclosed oncology targets in combination with our Boltbody ISAC technology and myeloid biology expertise to create new candidates for cancer treatments. Under the Original Innovent Agreement, the Company received an upfront payment of 5.0 million. We allocated the entire 5.0 million upfront payment to deferred revenue, which we recognized together with other payments received from Innovent as collaboration revenue over time as we fulfilled our performance obligation to Innovent. The Innovent agreement, as amended in March 2024, or the Amended Innovent Agreement, no longer meets the criteria under ASC 606. 2.5 million of deferred revenue allocated to the unsatisfied performance obligation as of the contract modification date was recognized as revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2024. 
 We expect that any collaboration revenue we generate from our current collaborations, and from any future collaboration partners, will fluctuate in the future as a result of the timing and outcome of development activities and the timing and amount paid, including upfront and milestone payments, and other factors. 
 We have not generated any revenue from product sales, and we do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize one of our product candidates. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development expenses have related primarily to early research and discovery activities and to preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates. Research and development expenses are recognized as incurred and payments made prior to the receipt of goods or services to be used in research and development are capitalized until the goods or services are received. 
 Research and development expenses include: 
 costs related to manufacturing our product candidates for clinical trials and preclinical studies, including fees paid to third-party CDMOs; 

salaries, payroll taxes, employee benefits and stock-based compensation charges for those individuals involved in research and development efforts; 

external research and development expenses, including lab materials and supplies and payments to CROs, investigative sites, and consultants to conduct our clinical trials and preclinical and non-clinical studies; and 

facilities and other allocated expenses which include direct and allocated expenses for rent, insurance, and other supplies. 

Our direct research and development expenses consist principally of external costs, such as fees paid to CROs and consultants in connection with our clinical and preclinical studies and costs related to manufacturing materials for our studies. Since our inception and through September 30, 2024, the majority of our third-party expenses were related to the research and development of trastuzumab imbotolimod, BDC-3042, and other product candidates. With the exception of costs incurred to satisfy our performance obligations under our collaboration agreements, we do not allocate employee costs and costs associated with our discovery efforts, laboratory supplies, and facilities, including other indirect costs, to specific product candidates as these costs are associated with multiple programs and, as such, are not separately classified. We use internal resources primarily to conduct our research as well as for managing our preclinical development, process development, manufacturing, and clinical development activities. We deploy our personnel across all of our research and development activities and, as our employees work across multiple programs, we do not currently track our costs by product candidate. 
 23 

We expect to continue to incur research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development of our product candidates, particularly as product candidates in later stages of development generally have higher development costs. We cannot determine with certainty the timing of initiation, the duration or the completion costs of future clinical trials and preclinical studies of our product candidates due to the inherently unpredictable nature of clinical and preclinical development. Clinical and preclinical development timelines, and the probability of success and development costs can differ materially from expectations. 
 We anticipate that we will make determinations as to which product candidates and development programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each product candidate or program on an ongoing basis in response to the results of ongoing and future preclinical studies and clinical trials, regulatory developments, and our ongoing assessments of each product candidate s commercial potential. We will need to raise substantial additional capital in the future. In addition, we cannot forecast which product candidates may be subject to future collaborations, when such arrangements will be secured, if at all, and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements. 
 Our future clinical development costs may vary significantly based on factors such as: 
 the number and scope of preclinical and IND-enabling studies; 

per-patient trial costs; 

the number of trials required for approval; 

the number of sites included in the trials; 

the countries in which the trials are conducted; 

the length of time required to enroll eligible patients; 

the number of patients who participate in the trials; 

the number of doses that patients receive; 

the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients; 

potential additional safety monitoring requested by regulatory agencies; 

the duration of patient participation in the trials and through all follow-up; 

the cost and timing of manufacturing our product candidates; 

the phase of development of our product candidates; and 

the safety and efficacy profile of our product candidates. 

General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance, and other administrative functions. Other significant costs include legal fees relating to intellectual property and corporate matters, professional fees for accounting and consulting services, and facility-related costs. We expect to continue to incur general and administrative expenses for the foreseeable future to support our ongoing research and development activities and the costs of operating as a public company. These costs will likely include expenses related to audit, legal, regulatory, and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with Nasdaq and SEC requirements, director and officer insurance premiums and investor relations costs associated with operating as a public company. 
 Restructuring Charges 
 Restructuring charges consist of one-time termination benefits such as severance costs and related benefits and stock-based compensation charges associated with a reduction-in-force.

Collaboration Revenue 
 Revenue was 1.1 million and 7.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 2.5 million and 5.8 million for the same periods in 2023, respectively. The decrease in the comparative three-month periods was due to no revenue being recognized from the Innovent collaboration as we had satisfied our performance obligation to Innovent in the prior quarter, partially offset by increased revenue recognized from our other collaborations as we fulfill our performance obligations to our collaboration partners. The increase in the comparable nine-month periods was due to the revenue recognized under the Amended Innovent Agreement in the first quarter of 2024 and the continued progress in our other collaborations as we fulfill our performance obligations to our collaboration partners. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses were 13.8 million and 45.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 15.0 million and 45.2 million for the same periods in 2023, respectively. The 1.2 million decrease between the comparable three-month periods was mainly due to a 2.1 million decrease in salary and related expenses primarily due to a decrease in headcount related to the reduction in workforce, a 0.5 million decrease in research and development contract service expenses and a 0.6 million decrease of facilities expenses offset by a 1.6 million increase in contract manufacturing expenses related to the timing of batch production of our product candidates and a 0.6 million increase in clinical trial expenses in our clinical trials for BDC-1001 and costs related to existing patient and site visits as we work to close out the studies. 
 The increase of 0.5 million between the comparable nine-month periods was due to a 2.3 million increase in clinical trial expenses due to continued progress in our clinical trial for BDC-3042 and costs related to existing patient and site visits prior to the decision to cease the development of trastuzumab imbotolimod. The increase in expenses was further due to a 0.9 million increase in contract manufacturing expenses related to the timing of batch production of our product candidates and a 0.2 million increase in research and development contract service expenses offset by a 1.7 million decrease in salary and related expenses primarily due to a decrease in headcount related to the reduction in workforce, a 0.7 million decrease in facilities expenses and a 0.4 million decrease in consulting expenses. 
 
 25 

General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses were 3.8 million and 14.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 5.8 million and 17.0 million for the same periods in 2023, respectively. The decrease of 2.0 million between the comparable three-month periods was mainly due to a 1.6 million decrease in salary, bonus and related expenses as a result of the restructuring plan and a 0.4 million decrease in consulting and professional expenses primarily related to decrease in legal expenses. The 2.5 million decrease in expenses between the comparable nine-month periods was mainly due to a 2.1 million decrease in salary, bonus and related expenses as a result of the restructuring plan, a 0.5 million decrease in consulting and professional expenses primarily related to a decrease in legal expenses, offset by a 0.2 million increase in facilities expenses. 
 Restructuring Charges 
 Restructuring charges were 3.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consisting of 2.9 million of one-time termination benefits such as severance costs and related benefits and 0.7 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense as a result of a restructuring plan. There were no restructuring charges in three months ended September 30, 2024 and in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other Income, Net 
 Interest Income, Net 
 Interest income was 1.3 million and 4.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 1.9 million and 5.1 million for the same periods in 2023, respectively. The interest income, net was primarily comprised of interest income from marketable securities. 
 Other Income 
 Other income was zero and 4.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and zero for the same periods in 2023. The other income in 2024 was due to the one-time payment received from Innovent under the Amended Innovent Agreement. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 We have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception and anticipate we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of 84.4 million and an accumulated deficit of 411.5 million. Our net losses were 15.2 million and 47.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 16.3 million and 51.3 million for the same periods in 2023, respectively, and we expect to incur additional losses in the future. We evaluated our current cash position, historical results, forecasted cash flows and plans with regard to liquidity. 
 We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least 12 months following the issuance date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our investment policy prioritizes preservation of principal and availability of cash to meet cash flow requirements then maximization of total net returns after satisfying the first two conditions. Our policy only allows for investments in fixed-income instruments such as corporate bonds and government securities. We believe we will meet longer term expected future cash requirements and obligations through a combination of cash flows from operating activities, available cash balances, and equity or debt financings or other capital sources, including potential collaborations, licenses, and other similar arrangements. 
 Shelf Registration and At-The-Market Equity Offering 
 On March 30, 2022, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3, or the Registration Statement. Pursuant to the Registration Statement, we may offer and sell securities having an aggregate public offering price of up to 250.0 million. In connection with the filing of the Registration Statement, we also entered into a sales agreement with TD Cowen, or Cowen, as sales agent or principal, pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock for an aggregate offering price of up to 75.0 million under an at-the-market offering program, or the ATM. Pursuant to the ATM, we will pay Cowen a commission rate equal to 3.0 of the gross proceeds from the sale of any shares of common stock. We are not obligated to make any sales of shares of our common stock under the ATM. As of September 30, 2024, no shares of our common stock have been sold under the ATM.

Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 46.9 million and 55.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to our net loss of 47.2 million, adjusted down for 7.6 million of non-cash charges and up for a 7.2 million change in operating assets and liabilities. The non-cash charges were comprised of 6.2 million for stock-based compensation, 2.4 million of non-cash lease-related expense, and 1.4 million for depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by 2.3 million for accretion of discount on marketable securities and 0.1 million gain on sale of property and equipment. The change in net operating assets was primarily due to a 5.5 million decrease in our deferred revenue, a 2.2 million decrease in our accounts payable and accrued expenses, and a 2.0 million decrease in operating lease liabilities, offset by a 2.5 million decrease in our prepaid expenses and other current assets. Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to our net loss of 51.3 million, adjusted down for 7.4 million of non-cash charges and up for a 11.4 million change in operating assets and liabilities. The non-cash charges were comprised of 7.2 million for stock-based compensation, 3.3 million for accretion of discount on marketable securities, 2.2 million of non-cash lease-related expense, and 1.4 million for depreciation and amortization expense. The change in net operating assets was primarily due to a 4.6 million decrease in our accounts payable and accrued expenses, and the remaining changes contributed to a 2.9 million decrease in our deferred revenue and a 1.8 million decrease in our operating lease liabilities, and a 2.2 million increase in our prepaid expenses and other current assets. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash provided by investing activities was 45.3 million and 55.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to 120.8 million in maturities of marketable securities, offset by 75.6 million in purchases of marketable securities. The net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to a 188.3 million maturities of marketable securities, offset by a 132.8 million in purchases of marketable securities. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 0.1 million for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to net proceeds from the issuance of common stock from our employee stock purchase plan. The net cash provided by financing activities for the same period in 2023 was due to net proceeds from the issuance of common stock from our employee stock purchase plan and exercise of stock options. 
 Funding Requirements 
 Based upon our current operating plans, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months following the issuance date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We will need to raise additional capital to continue the advancement of our programs. In the near term, our primary uses of cash will be to fund the completion of key milestones for clinical programs and to fund our operations, including research and development activities and employee salaries. This includes significant costs relating to clinical trials and manufacturing our product candidates. Our uses of cash in the long term will be similar as we advance our research and development activities and pay employee salaries. Most pharmaceutical products require larger clinical trials as development progresses, and we expect our funding requirements to grow with the advancement of our programs. Our long-term funding requirements will depend on many factors, which are uncertain but include our portfolio prioritization decisions and the success of our collaborations. In turn, our ability to raise additional capital 
 27 

through equity or partnering will depend on the general economic environment in which we operate and our ability to achieve key milestones. Our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could deplete our capital resources sooner than we expect. Additionally, the process of testing product candidates in clinical trials is costly, and the timing of progress and expenses in these trials is uncertain. 
 Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: 
 the type, number, scope, progress, expansions, results, costs, and timing of our clinical trials; 

the type, number, scope, results, costs, and timing of preclinical studies for our product candidates or other potential product candidates or indications we are pursuing or may choose to pursue in the future; 

the outcome, timing, and costs of regulatory review of our product candidates; 

the costs and timing of manufacturing for our product candidates, including commercial manufacturing; 

our efforts to enhance operational systems and hire additional personnel to satisfy our obligations as a public company, including enhanced internal controls over financial reporting; 

the costs associated with hiring additional personnel and consultants as our preclinical and clinical activities increase; 

the costs and timing of establishing or securing sales and marketing capabilities if any product candidate is approved; 

our ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance, coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors and adequate market share and revenue for any approved products; 

patients willingness to pay out-of-pocket for any approved products in the absence of coverage and/or adequate reimbursement from third-party payors; 

the terms and timing of establishing and maintaining collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements; 

the costs of obtaining, maintaining, defending, and enforcing our patent and other intellectual property rights; and 

costs associated with any product candidates, products, or technologies that we may in-license or acquire. 

Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from sales of our product candidates, if ever, we expect to finance our cash needs through equity or debt financings or other capital sources, including potential collaborations, licenses, the sale of future royalties, and other similar arrangements. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements on favorable terms or at all. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be or could be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing and equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends. If we raise funds through collaborations, or other similar arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our product candidates, future revenue streams or research programs or may have to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us and/or may reduce the value of our common stock. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market our product candidates even if we would otherwise prefer to develop and market such product candidates ourselves.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 Refer to Note 5 Collaborations and Note 6 Commitments and Contingencies, to our unaudited condensed financial statements contained in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for information regarding our contractual obligations and commitments. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, other than as set forth below. 
 Long-lived Assets Impairment Assessment 
 Long-lived assets, including operating lease assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset group to our estimate of future net cash flows to be generated by such assets. If such asset group is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group. 
 29 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information under this item. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Based on their evaluation, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Accounting Officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 From time to time, we might be subject to various legal proceedings relating to claims arising out of our operations. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against us in a reporting period for amounts above management s expectations, our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Except as described below, we are not currently involved in any material legal proceedings, the ultimate disposition of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition or cash flows. 
 Refer to Note 6 Commitments and Contingencies, to our unaudited condensed financial statements contained in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for information regarding our legal proceedings. 
 Item 1A. Ris k Factors. 
 There are no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, other than as set forth below. 
 Our recent restructuring designed to reduce our operating expenses may not result in our intended outcomes and may yield unintended consequences and additional costs. 
 In May 2024, we implemented a restructuring plan, including a reduction in force affecting 50 employees, or 50 of our workforce. The decision was based on cost reduction initiatives intended to reduce operating expenses. In connection with the restructuring, we will discontinue developing trastuzumab imbotolimod, formerly known as BDC-1001. 
 The restructuring may result in unintended consequences and costs, such as the loss of institutional knowledge and expertise, attrition beyond the intended number of employees, decreased morale among our remaining employees, and the risk that we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the restructuring. In addition, while positions have been eliminated certain functions necessary to our operations remain, and we may be unsuccessful in distributing the duties and obligations of departed employees among our remaining employees. The restructuring could also make it difficult for us to pursue, or prevent us from pursuing, new opportunities and initiatives due to insufficient personnel, or require us to incur additional and unanticipated costs to hire new personnel to pursue such opportunities or initiatives. If we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from the restructuring, if we experience significant adverse consequences from the restructuring, or if we are otherwise unable to retain our employees, our ability to compete and continue the clinical development of our product candidates may be harmed. 
 30 

Our failure to meet the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC could result in a delisting of our common stock. 
 On July 2, 2024, we received a written notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC or Nasdaq, notifying us that on July 1, 2024, the average closing price of our common stock over the prior 30 consecutive trading days had fallen below 1.00 per share, which is the minimum average closing price required to maintain listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1), or the Minimum Bid Requirement. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we have 180 calendar days to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement, or the Grace Period, subject to a potential 180 calendar day extension, as described below. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of our common stock must be at least 1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days within the Grace Period. If we do not achieve compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement by December 30, 2024, the end of the Grace Period, we may be eligible for an additional 180 calendar day period to regain compliance. To qualify, we would be required to meet the continued listing requirement for the market value of our publicly held shares and all other Nasdaq initial listing standards, with the exception of the bid price requirement, and would need to provide written notice of our intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period by effecting a reverse stock split if necessary. However, if it appears to Nasdaq staff that we will not be able to cure the deficiency, or if we do not meet the other listing standards, Nasdaq could provide notice that our common stock will be subject to delisting. In the event we receive notice that our common stock is being delisted, we would be entitled to appeal the determination to a Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel and request a hearing. 
 The delisting of our common stock from Nasdaq may make it more difficult for us to raise capital on favorable terms in the future, or at all. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. Further, if our common stock were to be delisted from Nasdaq, our common stock would cease to be recognized as a covered security and we would be subject to additional regulation in each state in which we offer our securities. Moreover, there is no assurance that any actions that we take to restore our compliance with the Nasdaq minimum bid requirement would allow our securities to be listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from falling below the Nasdaq minimum share price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with Nasdaq s listing requirements. 
 There can be no assurance that we will continue to meet the minimum bid price requirement, or any other requirement in the future. If we fail to meet the minimum bid price requirement, or other applicable Nasdaq listing requirements, including maintaining minimum levels of stockholders equity or market values of our common stock, our common stock could be delisted. If our common stock were to be delisted, the liquidity of our common stock would be adversely affected, and the market price of our common stock could decrease. Additionally, if our securities are not listed on, or become delisted from, Nasdaq for any reason, and are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, an inter-dealer automated quotation system for equity securities that is not a national securities exchange, the liquidity and price of our securities may be more limited than if we were quoted or listed on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange. You may be unable to sell your securities unless a market can be established or sustained. 
 Unless our common stock continues to be listed on a national securities exchange it will become subject to the so-called penny stock rules that impose restrictive sales practice requirements. 
 If we are unable to maintain the listing of our common stock on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange, our common stock could become subject to the so-called penny stock rules if the shares have a market value of less than 5.00 per share. The SEC has adopted regulations that define a penny stock to include any stock that has a market price of less than 5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions, including an exception for stock traded on a national securities exchange. The SEC regulations impose restrictive sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. An accredited investor generally is a person whose individual annual income exceeded 200,000, or whose joint annual income with a spouse exceeded 300,000 during the past two years and who expects their annual income to exceed the applicable level during the current year, or a person with net worth in excess of 1.0 million, not including the value of the investor s principal residence and excluding mortgage debt secured by the investor s principal residence up to the estimated fair market value of the home, except that any mortgage debt incurred by the investor within 60 days prior to the date of the transaction shall not be excluded from the determination of the investor s net worth unless the mortgage debt was incurred to acquire the residence. For transactions covered by this rule, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and must have received the purchaser s written consent to the transaction prior to sale. This means that if we are unable maintain the listing of our common stock on a national securities exchange, the ability of stockholders to sell their common stock in the secondary market could be adversely affected. 
 31 

If a transaction involving a penny stock is not exempt from the SEC s rule, a broker-dealer must deliver a disclosure schedule relating to the penny stock market to each investor prior to a transaction. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and its registered representative, current quotations for the penny stock, and, if the broker-dealer is the sole market-maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer s presumed control over the market. Finally, monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the customer s account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.

 1. I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of Bolt Biotherapeutics, Inc.; 
 2. Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
 3. Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
 4. I am responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over
