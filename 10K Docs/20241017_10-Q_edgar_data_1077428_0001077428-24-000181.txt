 At September 30, 2024, the Company had available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, comprised of U.S. Treasury securities, residential mortgage-backed securities and CRT securities. The unrealized losses on the available-for-sale debt securities were the result of changes in market interest rates compared to the date the securities were acquired rather than the credit quality of the issuers or underlying loans. The Company does not currently intend to sell and based on current conditions it does not believe it is likely that the Company will be required to sell these available-for-sale debt securities before recovery of the amortized cost of such securities in an unrealized loss position and has therefore recorded the unrealized losses related to this portfolio in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss), net AOCI ). Held-to-maturity securities consist of government guaranteed securities for which loss is expected. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, allowance for credit losses was established for available-for-sale or held-to-maturity debt securities. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, debt securities with carrying values of approximately and million, respectively, were pledged to secure certain customer deposits.

 During the third quarter of 2024, the Company purchased a million commercial loan portfolio, which included certain loans that had experienced a more than insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination PCD loans ). PCD loans are recorded at fair value at the acquisition date along with an allowance for credit losses determined using the same methodology as originated loans. The sum of the loan s purchase price and allowance for credit losses becomes its initial amortized cost basis. The difference between the initial amortized cost basis and the par value of the loan is a non-credit discount or premium, which is amortized into interest income over the life of the loan. Subsequent changes to the allowance for credit losses are recorded through provision for credit losses.

 capital conservation buffer comprised of CET1, with respect to each of CET1, Tier 1 and total capital to risk-weighted asset ratios. A financial institution with a conservation buffer of less than the required amount is subject to limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and stock repurchases, and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. No dividends were declared or paid on the Company s common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or during 2023. On January 17, 2024, the Company s board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program under which the Company could repurchase up to million in shares of its outstanding common stock, which is set to expire on January 31, 2025. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased shares of its common stock for an aggregate price, including excise tax expense, of million, at a weighted average price of per share. 
 In February 2019, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule (the 2019 CECL Rule that revised certain capital regulations to account for changes to credit loss accounting under GAAP. The 2019 CECL Rule included a transition option that allows banking organizations to phase in, over a three-year period, the day-one adverse effects of adopting the new accounting standard related to the measurement of current expected credit losses on their regulatory capital ratios (three-year transition option). In March 2020, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule that maintains the three-year transition option of the 2019 CECL Rule and also provides banking organizations that were required under GAAP to implement CECL before the end of 2020 the option to delay for two years an estimate of the effect of CECL on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodology's effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period (five-year transition option). The Company adopted CECL on January 1, 2020 and has elected to utilize the five-year transition option. The ratios presented below include the effects of the election to utilize the five-year CECL transition described above. 
 Because the Bank had less than billion in total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2009, it is allowed to continue to classify the trust preferred securities, all of which were issued prior to May 19, 2010, as Tier 1 capital. 
 At the beginning of each of the last five years of the life of the Bank-issued fixed rate subordinated notes due 2026, the amount that is eligible to be included in Tier 2 capital is reduced by 20 of the original amount of the notes (net of redemptions). In 2024, the amount of the notes that qualify as Tier 2 capital has been reduced by 80 .

The Company s credit exposure associated with these instruments, net of any collateral pledged, was approximately million at September 30, 2024 and approximately million at December 31, 2023. Collateral levels are monitored and adjusted on a regular basis for changes in the value of derivative instruments. At September 30, 2024, the Company had million in cash collateral pledged to counterparties included in interest bearing cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheet and million in cash collateral received from counterparties included in interest bearing deposits on the consolidated balance sheet. The comparative amounts at December 31, 2023, were million in cash collateral pledged to counterparties and million cash collateral received from counterparties. 
 The Company also enters into credit risk participation agreements with financial institution counterparties for interest rate swaps related to loans in which the Company is either a participant or a lead bank. The risk participation agreements entered into by the Company as a participant bank provide credit protection to the financial institution counterparty should the borrower fail to perform on its interest rate derivative contract with that financial institution. The Company is party to risk participation agreements where it acts as a participant bank with a notional amount of million at September 30, 2024, compared to risk participation agreements with a notional amount of million at December 31, 2023. The maximum estimated exposure to these agreements, assuming 100 default by all obligors, was approximately million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023. The fair value of these exposures was insignificant to the consolidated financial statements at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Risk participation agreements entered into by the Company as the lead bank provide credit protection should the borrower fail to perform on its interest rate derivative contract. The Company is party to risk participation agreements where the Company acts as the lead bank having a notional amount of million at September 30, 2024, compared to agreements having a notional amount of million at December 31, 2023. 
 Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow Hedges 
 The Company enters into interest rate derivative contracts that are designated as qualifying cash flow hedges to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows attributable to changes in a contractually specified interest rate. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded million in unrealized losses to adjust its cash flow hedges to fair value, which was recorded net of tax to AOCI, and reclassified million from AOCI as a decrease to interest income on loans. Based on current market conditions, the Company estimates that during the next 12 months, an additional million related to active and terminated hedges will be reclassified from AOCI as a decrease to interest income. As of September 30, 2024, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is years.

 Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023 
 The Company reported net loss of 61.3 million and net loss available to common stockholders of 65.6 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to net income of 61.7 million and net income available to common stockholders of 57.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. On a fully diluted basis, earnings/(loss) per common share was (1.41) for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 1.18 for the same period in 2023. ROE was (8.87) and ROA was (0.78) for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 8.08 and 0.81 , respectively, for the same period in 2023. The decrease in net income for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 resulted primarily from a decrease in non-interest income, resulting primarily from the 179.6 million loss on sale of available-for-sale debt securities during the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023

On a fully diluted basis, earnings/(loss) per common share was (0.14) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.20 for the same period in 2023. ROE was (0.30) and ROA was 0.03 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 7.46 and 0.77 , respectively, for the same period in 2023. The decrease in net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 resulted primarily from a decrease in non-interest income, also primarily as a result of the loss on sale of available-for-sale debt securities described above.

Net Interest Income 
 
 Net interest income was 240.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 232.1 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases in average total LHI and yields on average earning assets, partially offset by an increase in average interest bearing liabilities. 
 Average earning assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 997.5 million compared to the same period in 2023, which included increases of 901.7 million in average total loans held for investment and 110.1 million in average investment securities, partially offset by a 6.2 million decrease in average interest bearing cash and cash equivalents. Average interest bearing liabilities increased 1.5 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to a 2.1 billion increase in average interest bearing deposits, partially offset by decreases of 380.9 million in average short-term borrowings and 198.1 million in average long-term debt. Average non-interest bearing deposits for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 9.4 billion from 10.0 billion for the same period in 2023. 
 Net interest margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.16 , compared to 3.13 for the same period in 2023. The increase in net interest margin was primarily due to an increase in yields on investment securities, partially offset by an increase in the cost of interest bearing deposits. The increases in yields on earnings assets and cost of funds are attributed to the impact of rising interest rates. 
 The yield on total loans held for investment increased to 6.62 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6.58 for the same period in 2023, and the yield on earning assets increased to 5.96 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.75 for the same period in 2023. Total cost of deposits increased to 2.94 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.62 for the same period in 2023, and total funding costs, including non-interest bearing deposits and stockholders' equity, increased to 2.76 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.60 for the same period in 2023. 
 
 Net interest income was 671.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 699.4 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to increases in the cost of interest bearing deposits and average interest bearing deposits, partially offset by an increase in yields on average earnings assets and an increase in average total loans held for investment. 
 Average earning assets increased 511.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, which included increases of 852.5 million in average total loans held for investment and 155.7 million in average

 investment securities, partially offset by a decrease of 496.5 million in average interest bearing cash and cash equivalents. Average interest bearing liabilities increased 1.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to an increase of 2.0 billion in average interest bearing deposits, partially offset by a 394.2 million decrease in average short-term borrowings and 125.4 million decrease in average long-term debt. Average non-interest bearing deposits for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 8.9 billion from 10.0 billion for the same period in 2023. 
 Net interest margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.07 , compared to 3.25 for the same period of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the effect of rising interest rates on the cost of interest bearing deposits, partially offset by higher earning asset yields, also as a result of rising interest rates, compared to the same period in 2023. 
 The yield on total loans held for investment increased to 6.66 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6.53 for the same period in 2023, and the yield on earning assets increased to 5.90 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.63 for the same period in 2023. Total cost of deposits increased to 2.97 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.36 for the same period in 2023 and total funding costs, including non-interest bearing deposits and stockholders' equity, increased to 2.80 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.36 for the same period in 2023.

 Non-interest income decreased 161.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the 179.6 million loss on sale of available-for-sale debt securities recognized during the third quarter of 2024, partially offset by increases in investment banking and advisory fees and other non-interest income. 
 
 Non-interest income decreased 153.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 130.3 million for the same period in 2023, primarily due to the 179.6 million loss on sale of available-for-sale debt securities recognized during the third quarter of 2024, partially offset by an increase in investment banking and advisory fees.

 Non-interest expense increased 15.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits, occupancy expense and communications and technology expense, partially offset by a decrease in legal and professional expense. The third quarter of 2024 included restructuring expenses of 2.4 million recorded in salaries and benefits, 476,000 recorded in occupancy expense and 3.1 million recorded in communications and technology expense. The third quarter of 2024 also included a 651,000 release of FDIC special assessment accrual.

 assessment, partially offset by a decrease in legal and professional expense. Non-interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included restructuring expenses of 4.4 million recorded in salaries and benefits, 476,000 recorded in occupancy expense and 3.1 million recorded in communications and technology expense, as well as 2.8 million in FDIC special assessment expense. The decrease in legal and professional expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted primarily from declines in professional services, partially offset by a 5.0 million legal settlement expense recognized in the first quarter of 2024. 
 
 Analysis of Financial Condition 
 Loans Held for Investment 
 The following table summarizes the Company s loans held for investment by portfolio segment. See Note 1 - Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the 2023 Form 10-K for details of these portfolio segments. 
 (in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Commercial 10,967,807 10,410,766 Mortgage finance 5,529,659 3,978,328 Commercial real estate 5,314,814 5,500,774 Consumer

 (87,071) (80,258) Total loans held for investment 22,294,171 20,340,558 
 Total loans held for investment were 22.3 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of 2.0 billion from December 31, 2023. The Company experienced loan growth in all loan categories, except for commercial real estate, as it has continued to execute on its long-term strategy. Commercial loan growth includes the impact of the acquisition of a 332.0 million loan portfolio completed during the third quarter of 2024. Mortgage finance loans relate to the mortgage warehouse lending operations in which the Company purchases mortgage loan ownership interests that are typically sold within 10 to 20 days and represent 25 and 19 of gross loans held for investment at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Volumes fluctuate based on the level of market demand for the product and the number of days between purchase and sale of the loans, which can be affected by changes in overall market interest rates, and tend to peak at the end of each month. 
 The Company originates a substantial majority of all loans held for investment. The Company also participates in shared national credits, both as a participant and as an agent. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 5.3 billion in shared national credits, 1.0 billion of which the Company administered as agent. All syndicated loans, whether the Company acts as agent or participant, are underwritten to the same standards as all other loans the Company originates. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 16.5 million of the Company s shared national credits were on non-accrual. 
 
 Portfolio Concentrations 
 Although more than 50 of the Company s total loan exposure is outside of Texas and more than 50 of deposits are sourced outside of Texas, Texas concentration remains significant. As of September 30, 2024, a majority of the loans held for investment, excluding mortgage finance and other national lines of business, were to businesses with headquarters or operations in Texas. This geographic concentration subjects the Company s loan portfolio to the general economic conditions within this state. The risks created by this concentration have been considered by management in the determination of the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses.

 Summary of Credit Loss Experience 
 The provision for credit losses, comprised of a provision for loans and off-balance sheet credit losses, is a charge to earnings to maintain the allowance for credit losses at a level consistent with management s assessment of expected losses at each balance sheet date. 
 The Company recorded a provision for credit losses of 49.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a provision of 53.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflects growth in loans held for investment and 28.8 million in net charge-offs recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company recorded 28.8 million in net charge-offs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 37.1 million in net charge-offs during the same period in 2023. Criticized loans totaled 897.7 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 738.2 million at December 31, 2023.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity 
 In general terms, liquidity is a measurement of the Company s ability to meet its cash needs. The Company s objectives in managing its liquidity are to maintain the ability to meet loan commitments, repurchase investment securities and repay deposits and other liabilities in accordance with their terms, without an adverse impact on current or future earnings. The Company s liquidity strategy is guided by policies, formulated and monitored by senior management and the Asset and Liability Management Committee ALCO ), which take into account the demonstrated marketability of the Company s assets, the sources and stability of its funding and the level of unfunded commitments. The Company regularly evaluates all of its various funding sources with an emphasis on accessibility, stability, reliability and cost-effectiveness. The Company s principal source of funding is customer deposits, supplemented by short-term borrowings, primarily from federal funds purchased and Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB borrowings, which are generally used to fund mortgage finance assets, and long-term debt. The Company also relies on the availability of the mortgage secondary market provided by Ginnie Mae and government sponsored entities to support the liquidity of mortgage finance assets. 
 The following table summarizes the Company s interest bearing cash and cash equivalents: 
 (dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Interest bearing cash and cash equivalents 3,894,537 3,042,357 Interest bearing cash and cash equivalents as a percent of: Total loans held for investment 17.5 15.0 Total earning assets 12.8 11.1 Total deposits 15.1 13.6 
 The Company s goal is to obtain as much of its funding for loans held for investment and other earning assets as possible from customer deposits, which are generated principally through development of long-term customer relationships, with a significant focus on treasury management products. In addition, the Company also has access to deposits through brokered channels. The following table summarizes period-end total deposits:

 Estimated uninsured assessable deposits, including accrued interest, were 40 of total deposits at September 30, 2024, compared to 43 of total deposits at December 31, 2023. The uninsured amounts are estimated based on the methodologies and assumptions used for the Bank s regulatory reporting requirements. 
 The Company has short-term borrowing sources available to supplement deposits and meet its funding needs. Such borrowings are generally used to fund mortgage finance loans, due to their liquidity, short duration and interest spreads available. These borrowing sources include federal funds purchased from downstream correspondent bank relationships (which consist of banks that are smaller than the Bank) and from upstream correspondent bank relationships (which consist of banks that are larger than the Bank), customer repurchase agreements and advances from the FHLB and the Federal Reserve. The following table summarizes short-term borrowings, all of which mature within one year:

 (2) Unsecured revolving, non-amortizing line of credit with maturity date of February 8, 2025. Proceeds may be used for general corporate purposes, including funding regulatory capital infusions into the Bank. The loan agreement contains customary financial covenants and restrictions. No borrowings were made against this line of credit during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. 
 The Company has long-term debt outstanding of 660.2 million as of September 30, 2024, comprised of trust preferred securities and subordinated notes with maturity dates ranging from January 2026 to December 2036. See Note 5 - Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information. The Company may consider raising additional capital, if needed, in public or private offerings of debt or equity securities to supplement deposits and meet its long-term funding needs. 
 As the Company is a holding company and is a separate operating entity from the Bank, the Company s primary sources of liquidity are dividends received from the Bank and borrowings from outside sources. Banking regulations may limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by the Bank. See Note 7 - Regulatory Ratios and Capital in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding dividend restrictions and Liquidity Risks included in Part I, Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Periodically, based on market conditions and other factors, and subject to compliance with applicable laws and regulations and the terms of its existing indebtedness, the Company may repay, repurchase, exchange or redeem outstanding indebtedness, or otherwise enter into transactions regarding debt or capital structure. For example, the Company periodically evaluates and may engage in liability management transactions, including repurchases or redemptions of outstanding subordinated notes, which may be funded by the issuance of, or exchanges of, newly issued unsecured borrowings to actively manage the debt maturity profile and interest cost. 
 Capital Resources 
 The Company s equity capital averaged 3.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.1 billion for the same period in 2023. The Company has not paid any cash dividends on common stock since operations commenced and has no plans to do so in the foreseeable future.

Table of Contents 

 On January 17, 2024, the Company s board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to 150.0 million in shares of its outstanding common stock. Remaining repurchase authorization under the January 18, 2023 share repurchase program was terminated upon authorization of this new program. Any repurchases under the repurchase program will be made in accordance with applicable securities laws from time to time in open market or private transactions. The extent to which the Company repurchases shares, and the timing of such repurchases, will be at management s discretion and will depend upon a variety of factors, including market conditions, our capital position and amount of retained earnings, regulatory requirements and other considerations. The share repurchase program is set to expire on January 31, 2025, and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 1,381,436 shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price, including excise tax expense, of 81.5 million, at a weighted average price of 58.57 per share. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 SEC guidance requires disclosure of critical accounting estimates. The SEC defines critical accounting estimates as those estimates made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the registrant. 
 The Company follows financial accounting and reporting policies that are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The more significant of these policies are summarized in Note 1 - Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K. Not all significant accounting policies require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments. However, the policy noted below could be deemed to meet the SEC s definition of a critical accounting policy. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 Management considers the policies related to the allowance for credit losses as the most critical to the financial statement presentation. The total allowance for credit losses includes activity related to allowances calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 326, Credit Losses . The allowance for credit losses is established through a provision for credit losses charged to current earnings. The amount maintained in the allowance reflects management s continuing evaluation of the credit losses expected to be recognized over the life of the loans in the Company s portfolio. The allowance for credit losses on loans is a valuation account that is deducted from the loans' amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet financial instruments is recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. For purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses, the loan portfolio is segregated into pools first by portfolio segment and then by past due status or credit grade. Each pool is assigned a loss estimate, reflecting historical loss rates that incorporate probability of default and severity of losses over the estimated remaining life of the loans. Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis and are not included in the collective (pool) evaluation. Management estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information from internal and external sources relating to past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Modifications to loss estimates are made to incorporate a reasonable and supportable forecast of future losses at the pool level, as well as any necessary qualitative adjustments using a Portfolio Level Qualitative Factor PLQF and/or a Portfolio Segment Level Qualitative Factor SLQF ). A similar process is employed to calculate a reserve assigned to off-balance sheet financial instruments, specifically unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. Modified loss estimates are assigned based on the balance of the commitments estimated to be outstanding at the time of default. The PLQF and SLQF are utilized to address factors that are not present in historical loss rates and are otherwise unaccounted for in the quantitative process. A reserve is recorded upon origination or purchase of a loan. See Summary of Credit Loss Experience above and Note 4 - Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further discussion of the risk factors considered by management in establishing the allowance for credit losses. 
 Management considers a range of macroeconomic scenarios in connection with the allowance estimation process. Within the various economic scenarios considered as of September 30, 2024, the quantitative estimate of the allowance for credit loss would increase by approximately 108.3 million under sole consideration of the most severe downside scenario. The quoted sensitivity calculation reflects the sensitivity of the modeled allowance estimate to macroeconomic forecast data, but is absent of qualitative overlays and other qualitative adjustments that are part of the quarterly reserving process and does not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the allowance for reasons including increases or decreases in qualitative adjustments, changes in the risk profile and size of the portfolio, changes in the severity of the macroeconomic scenario and the range of scenarios under management consideration.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Market risk represents the potential economic loss on trading and non-trading portfolios and financial instruments due to adverse price movements in markets including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, commodity prices and equity and related implied volatility levels. The Company is subject to market risk primarily through the effect of changes in interest rates on its portfolio of assets held for purposes other than trading and interest rate derivative instruments that are used for managing interest rate risk. 
 In addition, the Company has exposure to market risk through its trading desk that engages in fixed income and equity securities, derivatives and foreign exchange transactions to support the investing and hedging activities of customers. The Company uses Value-at-Risk VaR as a means to measure, monitor, and limit aggregate market risk on the trading portfolio. VaR is a statistical risk measure estimating potential loss at the 95th percentile based on a one-year history of market risk factors associated with the trading portfolio. VaR provides a consistent cross-asset measure for risk profiles and allows for diversification benefit based on historical correlations across market moves. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s exposure through its trading desk does not pose a significant market risk to the Company. All statistical models involve a degree of uncertainty and VaR is calculated at a statistical confidence interval of the 95th percentile based on one-year daily historic market moves. Larger economic losses are possible, particularly during stressed macroeconomic and market conditions. 
 The responsibility for managing market risk rests with the ALCO, which operates under policy guidelines established by the Company s board of directors. Oversight of the Company s compliance with the guidelines is the ongoing responsibility of the ALCO, with exceptions reported to the Executive Risk Committee and the board of directors, if necessary, on a quarterly basis. 
 Interest Rate Risk Management 
 The Company s interest rate sensitivity as of September 30, 2024 is illustrated in the following table. The table reflects rate-sensitive positions as of September 30, 2024 and is not necessarily indicative of positions on other dates. The table does not take into account the effect of the Company s derivatives designated as cash flow hedges. The balances of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities are presented in the periods in which they next reprice to market rates or mature and are aggregated to show the interest rate sensitivity gap. The mismatch between repricings or maturities within a time period is commonly referred to as the gap for that period. A positive gap (asset sensitive), where interest rate-sensitive assets exceed interest rate sensitive liabilities, generally will result in the net interest margin increasing in a rising rate environment and decreasing in a falling rate environment. A negative gap (liability sensitive) will generally have the opposite results on the net interest margin. Certain variable rate loans have embedded floors which limit the decline in yield on those loans at times when market interest rates are extraordinarily low. The degree of asset sensitivity, spreads on loans and net interest margin may be reduced until rates increase by an amount sufficient to eliminate the effects of floors. The adverse effect of floors as market rates increase may also be offset by the positive gap, the extent to which rates on deposits and other funding sources lag increasing market rates for loans and changes in composition of funding.

While a gap interest table is useful in analyzing interest rate sensitivity, an interest rate sensitivity simulation provides a better illustration of the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates. Earnings are also affected by the effects of changing interest rates on the value of funding derived from non-interest bearing deposits and stockholders equity. Management performs a sensitivity analysis to identify interest rate risk exposure on net interest income. Management also quantifies and measures interest rate risk exposure using a model to dynamically simulate the effect of changes in net interest income relative to changes in interest rates over the next twelve months based on different interest rate scenarios. These are a static rate scenario and shock test scenarios, as described below. 
 These scenarios are based on interest rates as of the last day of a reporting period published by independent sources and incorporate relevant spreads of instruments that are actively traded in the open market. The Federal Reserve s federal funds target affects short-term borrowing; the prime lending rate, SOFR, Bloomberg Short Term Yield Index and other alternative indexes are the basis for most of the variable-rate loan pricing. The 10-year treasury rate is also monitored because of its effect on prepayment speeds for mortgage-backed securities. These are the Company s primary interest rate exposures. Interest rate derivative contracts may be used to manage exposure to adverse fluctuations in these primary interest rate exposures as is discussed in more detail under the heading Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate and Other Risks below. 
 For modeling purposes, the shock test scenarios as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 assume immediate, sustained 100 and 200 basis point increases in interest rates as well as 100 and 200 basis point decreases in interest rates. The Company will continue to evaluate these scenarios as interest rates change. 
 The Company s interest rate risk exposure model incorporates assumptions regarding the level of interest rate, including indeterminable maturity deposits (non-interest bearing deposits, interest bearing transaction accounts and savings accounts) and loan and security prepayment behaviors for a given level of market rate change. In the current environment of changing short-term rates, deposit pricing can vary by product and customer. These assumptions have been developed through a combination of historical analysis and projection of future expected pricing behavior. Changes in prepayment behavior of mortgage-backed securities and residential and commercial mortgage loans in each rate environment are captured using industry estimates of prepayment speeds for various coupon segments of the portfolio. The impact of these changes is factored into the simulation model results and indicated interest rate sensitivity as follows: 
 Annualized Hypothetical Change in Net Interest Income September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 + 200 basis points 6.1 6.0 + 100 basis points 3.1 3.0 - 100 basis points (6.5) (4.3) - 200 basis points (13.5) (8.6) 
 The simulations used to manage market risk are based on numerous assumptions regarding the effect of changes in interest rates on the timing and extent of repricing characteristics, future cash flows and customer behavior. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income. Actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions, customer behavior and management strategies, among other factors. 
 Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate and Other Risks 
 In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into derivative transactions to manage various risks and to accommodate the business requirements of its customers. 
 On the date the Company enters into a derivative contract, the derivative is designated as either a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, net investment hedge, or a designation is not made as it is a customer-related transaction, an economic hedge for asset/liability risk management purposes or another stand-alone derivative created through the Company s operations. 
 To manage the sensitivity of earnings and capital to interest rate, prepayment, credit, price and foreign currency fluctuations (asset and liability management positions), the Company may enter into derivative transactions. In addition, the Company enters into interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts to support the business requirements of its customers (customer-related positions). 
 For additional information regarding derivatives, see Note 10 - Derivative Financial Instruments in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no action shall constitute Good Reason unless (A) Executive delivers to the Company written notice of the event alleged to constitute Good 
 7 

Reason within sixty (60) days following the date Executive first learns of the occurrence of such action, (B) the Company fails to remedy such action within thirty (30) days following receipt of such written notice, and (C) Executive actually terminates his employment within thirty (30) days following expiration of such cure period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company placing Executive on a paid leave for up to 30 days, pending the determination of whether there is a basis to terminate Executive for Cause based on a reasonable and good faith belief by the Board that such basis may, in fact, exist, will not constitute a Good Reason event. 
 (ii) Termination Without Cause by the Company or by Executive with Good Reason .

The Severance Payments shall mean (1) a cash severance payment equal to two (2) times the sum of (x) Executive s Base Salary and (y) Target Annual Incentive (not taking into account any reductions to Base Salary or Target Annual Incentive made in the prior 6 months or which would constitute Good Reason), (2) to the extent unpaid, an annual cash incentive payment for the completed fiscal year prior to the year of termination, (3) an annual cash incentive payment for the fiscal year of termination, based on the Target Annual Incentive, and pro-rated for the number of days in the fiscal year prior to the date of termination (the Pro-Rata Bonus and (4) for a period of 24 months, at the Company s expense, health and other welfare benefits that are not less favorable to Executive than the health and other welfare benefits to which Executive and his spouse were entitled immediately before Executive s employment termination triggering the severance payment (or equivalent cash payments to extent such benefit plan continuation is not permitted under applicable plans) provided that such 
 8 

benefits shall be modified to the extent benefits under an applicable plan are modified for active employees of the Company.

All amounts that may be due to Executive under this Article III.B .( iii shall be paid to Executive or to Executive s administrators, personal representatives, heirs and legatees, as may be appropriate.

If during the period of Executive s incapacity, Executive is deemed to have incurred a separation from service under Section 409A of the Code because there is no reasonable expectation that Executive will return to perform services for the Company, Executive shall be entitled, as a disability benefit, to continuation of Executive s Base Salary until the date on which this Agreement is terminated (the Disability Period provided, however, that such payments shall be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount of bona fide disability pay (within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-l(a)(5)) received or receivable by Executive during the Disability Period, provided such disability payments are made pursuant to a plan sponsored by the Company that covers a substantial number of employees of the Company and was established prior to the date Executive incurred a Disability, and further provided that such reduction does not otherwise affect the time of payment of Executive s Base Salary pursuant to this Article III.B. iii ). 
 C. Change in Control . The severance benefits provided for in this Article III.C. (i) and ii are referred to collectively as the Change in Control Payments and are conditioned upon the Release Effective Date occurring within 60 days following Executive s termination from employment. 
 (i) Severance Benefits . If Executive s employment with the Company is terminated (A) by the Company (or by the acquiring or successor business entity following a Change in Control (as defined below)) other than for Cause, death or Disability, or (B) by Executive with Good Reason, in each case, at any time during the period commencing ninety (90) days prior to the consummation of a Change in Control and ending on the two (2) year anniversary of the date of the Change in Control (the Change in Control Period , the Company shall pay or provide Executive with the Accrued Obligations and the Severance Payments described in Article III.B.(ii) provided, that, the cash severance benefit provided for in Article III.B.(ii)(1) shall be an amount equal to three (3) times the sum of (1) Executive s Base Salary plus (2) the Target Annual Incentive (not taking into account any reductions to Base Salary or Target Annual Incentive made in the prior 6 months or which would constitute Good Reason) and the benefit continuation described in Article III.B(ii)(4) shall be for a period of thirty-six (36) months. Payment of the cash severance benefits under this Article III.C.(i) shall be 
 10 

paid to Executive in a lump sum on the Company s first regularly scheduled payroll date following the Release Effective Date (less any amounts previously paid pursuant to Article III.B(ii)), provided, that if the date of such termination occurs on or after October 31 of a given calendar year, such payment will, subject to Article V.M. hereof, be paid in the immediately following calendar year on the date that is 60 days following the date of Executive s termination of employment (subject to the occurrence of the Release Effective Date). In addition, Executive shall become immediately and fully vested in his all of his unvested equity as described in Article II.C. regardless of whether the Release Effective Date occurs. 
 (ii) No Du p lication of Pa y ment . For clarity, the payment of severance benefits under this Article III.C. shall be in lieu of, and not in addition to, any payments under Article III.B. ii ), unless any payments under Article III.B(ii) had been made as a result of a termination of employment during the portion of the Change in Control Period that is prior to the date of a Change in Control. 
 (iii) Excess Parachute Payments . Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement, in the event that 
 (a) the aggregate payments or benefits to be made or afforded to Executive, whether under this Agreement or otherwise, which are determined to be parachute payments as defined in Section 280G of the Code or any successor thereof (the Parachute Payments ), would be determined to include an excess parachute payment under Section 280G of the Code, and 
 (b) if such Parachute Payments were reduced to an amount (the Non-Triggering Amount ), the value of which is one dollar 1.00) less than an amount equal to three times Executive s base amount, as determined in accordance with Section 280G of the Code and the Non-Triggering Amount less the product of the marginal rate of any applicable state and federal income tax and the Non-Triggering Amount would be greater than the aggregate value of the Parachute Payments (without such reduction) minus (a) the amount of tax required to be paid by Executive thereon by Section 4999 of the Code and further minus (b) the product of the Parachute Payments and the marginal rate of any applicable state and federal income tax, then the Parachute Payments shall be reduced to the Non-Triggering Amount (and, for clarity, if the Non-Triggering Amount would be less than such aggregate value, then no such reduction shall occur). The allocation of the reduction required hereby among the Parachute Payments shall be determined by Executive, in consultation with the Accountants (as defined below). 
 11 

(c) Unless Executive and the Company otherwise agree in writing, any determination required under this section shall be made in writing by a nationally recognized accounting firm selected by the Company subject to the approval of the Executive which shall not be unreasonably withheld (the Accountants ), whose determination shall be conclusive and binding upon Executive and the Company for all purposes absent manifest error. For purposes of making the calculations required by this section, the Accountants may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any determination by the Accountants under this Article III.C(iv)(c) will take into account the value of any reasonable compensation for services to be rendered by the Executive (or for holding oneself out as available to perform services and refraining from performing services (such as under a covenant not to compete)). The Accountants shall provide detailed supporting calculations to the Company and Executive as requested by the Company or Executive. Executive and the Company shall furnish to the Accountants such information and documents as the Accountants may reasonably request in order to make a determination under this section. The Company shall bear all costs the Accountants may incur in connection with any calculations contemplated by this section as well as any costs incurred by Executive with the Accountants for tax planning under Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. 
 (iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any restricted stock units and performance stock units or other awards or plans or programs in which Executive is participating at the time of termination of his employment, Executive s rights and benefits under each such award or plan shall be determined in accordance with the terms, conditions, and limitations of the award or plan and any separate agreement executed by Executive which may then be in effect (including this Agreement, which shall supersede such other award or plan or program unless specifically noted therein). 
 (v) For purposes of this Agreement, Change in Control shall have the meaning set forth in the Company s 2022 LTI Plan.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the termination of his employment for any reason, Executive may retain his contacts, calendars and personal correspondence and any information or documents reasonably necessary for the preparation of his personal tax returns.

 16 

Company s Confidential Information and business goodwill of the Company and the Company s Affiliates (including, as of the Effective Date, without limitation, BankDirect), Executive agrees to the following restrictive covenants 
 (i) Non-Solicitation of Customers . Executive agrees that during Executive s employment and for a period of 12 months following the termination of Executive s employment for any reason (the Restricted Period ), other than in connection with Executive s duties under this Agreement, Executive shall not, and shall not use any Confidential Information to, directly or indirectly, either as a principal, manager, agent, employee, consultant, officer, director, stockholder, partner, investor or lender or in any other capacity, and whether personally or through other persons, interfere with, or induce to curtail or cancel any business or contracts with the Company, or attempt to interfere with, or induce to curtail or cancel any business or contracts with the Company. Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit Executive from placing (or causing to be placed) general advertisements to solicit customers or clients. 
 (ii) Non-Solicitation of Employees . During the Restricted Period, other than in connection with Executive s duties under this Agreement, Executive shall not, and shall not use any Confidential Information to, on behalf of Executive or on behalf of any other person or entity, directly or indirectly, solicit, induce, recruit, engage, or attempt to, solicit, induce, recruit, engage, or encourage to leave or otherwise cease his her employment with the Company, any individual who is an employee of the Company or who was an employee of the Company within the 12-month period prior to Executive s termination from employment with the Company. Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit Executive from (i) placing (or causing to be placed) general advertisements soliciting employees or initiating a job candidate search, so long as such advertisements or job search are not targeted at employees of the Company or (ii) providing a reference to a third-party employer, upon request. 
 (iii) Non-Competition . Executive agrees that during Executive s employment and during the Restricted Period, Executive shall not, and shall not use any Confidential Information to, on behalf of Executive or on behalf of any other person or entity, directly or indirectly, (a) associate (including as a director, officer, employee, partner, consultant, agent or advisor) with a Competitive Enterprise, or (b) hold a 5 or greater equity (including stock options or other equity-based awards, whether or not vested or exercisable), voting or profit participation interest in a Competitive Enterprise (for clarity, other than the Company, for which Executive is specifically permitted to hold any amount of equity interests during the Restricted Period). Notwithstanding the foregoing, following a termination of Executive s employment, Executive s service as a non-employee member of the Board of Directors of another entity that is not a Competitive Enterprise with a substantial presence in markets serviced by the 
 17 

Company as of the date of such termination shall not constitute a violation of this provision, provided Executive complies with the other restrictive covenants contained in this Agreement in connection with such role and the Company acknowledges and agrees that such service shall not constitute a violation of the Forfeiture Condition. For the purposes of the immediately preceding sentence relating to permitted Board service, an entity will not be a Competitive Enterprise if less than 10 of its revenues are derived from businesses maintained by the Company. 
 (iv) Mutual Non-Disparagement . Executive agrees that the Company s goodwill and reputation are assets of great value to the Company which have been obtained and maintained through great costs, time and effort. Therefore, during Executive s employment and the thirty-six (36) months after the termination of Executive s employment for any reason, Executive shall not in any way disparage, libel or defame Disparage the Company, its business or business practices, its products or services, or its managers, officers, directors, or affiliates and after termination of Executive s employment, the Company will instruct its officers and members of the Board not to Disparage Executive. Additionally, the Company shall not make any official statement (whether written, verbal or otherwise) at any time during Executive s employment or the thirty-six (36) months thereafter that Disparages Executive. Nothing in this Article IV.B. iii is intended to interfere with Executive s right to engage in the conduct set forth in Article IV.A. iv ). Additionally, this Article IV.B(iii) shall not prohibit Executive from (a) rebutting false or misleading statements made by any of the parties named herein about Executive or (b) making customary competitive statements in the course of performing his duties to a subsequent employer or business partner, subject to Executive s other obligations under this Agreement. 
 C. Works . 
 (i) Assi g nment of Work Product . For the purposes of this Agreement, the term Work Product shall mean, collectively, all work product, information, inventions, original works of authorship, ideas, know-how, processes, designs, computer programs, photographs, illustrations, developments, trade secrets and discoveries, including improvements thereto, and all other intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, that the Executive conceives, creates, develops, makes, reduces to practice, or fixes in a tangible medium of expression, either alone or with others. During the Executive s employment with the Company and for a period of 12 months following the termination of the Executive s employment for any reason, Executive shall promptly make full written disclosure to the Company of all Work Product conceived, created, developed, made, reduced to practice, or fixed in a tangible medium of expression during the period of the Executive s employment with the Company and related to the Company s business. 
 18 

Executive hereby assigns and shall be deemed to have assigned to the Company or its designee, all of the Executive s right, title, and interest in and to any and all Work Product conceived, created, developed, made, reduced to practice, or fixed in a tangible medium of expression during the period of the Executive s employment with the Company that (a) relates in any manner to the previous, existing or contemplated business or work, of the Company (b) is or was suggested by, has resulted or will result from, or has arisen or will arise out of any work that the Executive has done or may do for or on behalf of the Company (c) has resulted or will result from or has arisen or will arise out of any materials or information that may have been disclosed or otherwise made available to the Executive as a result of duties assigned to the Executive by the Company or (d) has been or will be otherwise made through the use of the Company s time, information, facilities, or materials, even if conceived, created, developed, made, reduced to practice, or fixed during other than working hours. All original works of authorship that have been or will be made or fixed in a tangible medium of expression by the Executive (solely or jointly with others) within the scope of the Executive s employment with the Company will be considered Works Made for Hire, as that term is defined in the United States Copyright Act. Executive understands and agrees that the decision whether or not to commercialize or market any Work Product is within the Company s sole discretion and for the Company s sole benefit, and that no royalty will be due to the Executive based on commercialization of any Work Product. 
 (ii) Maintenance of Records . Executive agrees to keep and maintain adequate and current hard-copy and electronic records of all Work Product related to the Company s business made by the Executive (solely or jointly with others) during the term of the Executive s employment with the Company. The records will be available to and remain the sole property of the Company during the Executive s employment with the Company and at all times thereafter. 
 (iii) Patent and Copyright Re g istrations . Executive agrees to assist the Company, or its designee, at the Company s sole expense, in every proper way to secure the Company s rights in Work Product in any and all countries, including the disclosure to the Company of all pertinent information and data with respect thereto, the execution of all applications, specifications, oaths, assignments, affidavits, and all other instruments which the Company shall deem necessary in order to apply for and obtain such rights and in order to assign and convey to the Company, its successors, assigns, and nominees the sole and exclusive rights, title and interest in and to such Work Product. The Executive further agrees that the Executive s obligation to execute or cause to be executed, when it is in the Executive s power to do so, any such instrument or papers shall continue after the termination of this Agreement. 
 19 

D. Tolling . If Executive violates any of the restrictions contained in this Article IV , the Restricted Period with respect to such restriction shall be suspended and shall not run in favor of Executive from the time of the commencement of any violation until the time when Executive cures the violation to the satisfaction of the Company. The period of time during which Executive is in breach of a restriction shall be added to the Restricted Period in respect of such restriction, so long as the Company undertakes reasonable efforts to enforce such restriction promptly upon becoming aware of any alleged breach. 
 E. Remedies . Executive acknowledges that the restrictions contained in Article IV of this Agreement, in view of the nature of the Company s business and Executive s position with the Company, are reasonable and necessary to protect the Company s legitimate business interests. Executive further acknowledges and agrees that the covenants, obligations and agreements of Executive contained in Article IV concern special, unique and extraordinary matters and that a violation of any of the terms of these covenants, obligations or agreements may cause the Company irreparable injury for which adequate remedies at law may not be available. In the event of a material breach by Executive of Article IV of this Agreement, which is not cured (if curable) by Executive within thirty (30) days of his receipt of written notice from the Company of such material breach, Executive shall immediately forfeit any unpaid portion of the Severance Payments or Change in Control Payments, as applicable, from the date of such breach and the Company shall be entitled to (i) cease payment of any unpaid portion of the Severance Payments or Change in Control Payments, as applicable and (ii) recover any portion of the Severance Payments or Change in Control Payments, as applicable. Additionally, Executive agrees that the Company shall be entitled to seek an injunction, restraining order, and all other relief (without the requirement to post bond) as a court of competent jurisdiction may deem necessary or appropriate, in addition to damages and costs. The remedies in this Article IV.F. shall not be deemed the exclusive remedies for a breach or threatened breach of this Article IV but shall be in addition to all remedies available at law or in equity. The existence of any claim or cause of action Executive may have against the Company, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the Company s enforcement of the covenants in Article IV . No modification or waiver of any covenant contained in Article IV shall be valid unless the Company s Board approves the waiver or modification in writing (which for the avoidance of doubt, may be given via email). A Dispute, as defined in Article V , regarding a breach or threatened breach of this Article IV is not subject to the Dispute Resolution provisions in Article V rather, the Company and, as applicable, Executive, may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the covenants set forth in this Article IV . The Company and Executive irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts in the city of the Company s headquarters (Dallas, Texas) regarding the injunctive remedies set forth in this Article IV , provided that such court(s) has authority to issue injunctive relief restraining any alleged violation of Article IV . Each party waives all objections and defenses based on service of process, forum, venue, or personal or subject matter jurisdiction, as these defenses may relate to an application for injunctive relief in a suit or proceeding under this Article IV . 
 F. Reasonableness Validity . Executive hereby represents to the Company that Executive has read and understands, and agrees to be bound by, the terms of this Article IV . 
 20 

Executive acknowledges that the geographic area, scope and duration of the covenants contained in this Article IV are fair and reasonable in light of (i) the nature of the operations of the Company s business (ii) Executive s level of control over and contact with the business and (iii) the amount of compensation and Confidential Information that Executive is receiving in connection with Executive s employment with the Company. It is the desire and intent of the Parties that the provisions of Article IV be enforced to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, whether now or hereafter in effect and therefore, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Parties hereby waive any provision of applicable law that would render any provision of Article IV invalid or unenforceable. The Parties hereby agree that the terms and provisions of this Article IV are intended to be separate and divisible provisions and if, for any reason, any one or more of them is held to be invalid or unenforceable, neither the validity nor the enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement will thereby be affected. 
 G. Reformation . The Parties agree that the foregoing restrictions set forth in Article IV are reasonable under the circumstances and that any breach of the covenants contained in Article IV would cause irreparable injury to the Company. Executive understands that the foregoing restrictions may limit Executive s ability to engage in certain businesses during the Restricted Period, but acknowledges that Executive shall receive Confidential Information and sufficiently high remuneration and other benefits to justify such restrictions. If any of the aforesaid restrictions are found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unreasonable, overly broad, or otherwise unenforceable, the Parties intend for the restrictions herein set forth to be modified by the court making such determination so as to be reasonable and enforceable and, as so modified, to be fully enforced. By agreeing to this contractual modification prospectively at this time, the Parties intend to make this provision enforceable under the law or laws of all applicable jurisdictions so that the entire agreement not to compete and this Agreement as prospectively modified shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be rendered void or illegal. 
 H. Survival . Executive s post-termination obligations in Article IV shall survive the termination of this Agreement and Executive s termination of employment with the Company for any reason. 
 Article V MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS 
 A. Governing Law . This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to any conflict of law or choice of law rules.

 21 

(i) The parties to such Dispute shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such Dispute through negotiation between individuals with the authority to settle the Dispute on behalf of the parties (each, an Authorized Decision-Maker ). To this end, each such party shall cause an Authorized Decision-Maker to consult and negotiate with an Authorized Decision-Maker of the other party, and the parties shall attempt to reach a resolution satisfactory to both parties, recognizing that their mutual interests may not be aligned (and that each such party shall be entitled to reasonably seek to promote such party s own interests in such resolution). 
 (ii) If the parties do not resolve such Dispute within 30 days of the first negotiation between Authorized Decision-Makers, then upon written notice by either party to the other, the Dispute shall be submitted to non-binding mediation to be administered in Dallas, Texas, by the American Arbitration Association or its successor (the AAA (or another mediator upon the mutual agreement of Executive and the Company). Such mediation session shall take place within 60 days of the date of receipt of the written request for mediation. If the parties are not able to agree regarding the identity of the mediator within 20 days from the party s delivery of the mediation demand to the other party, the AAA shall appoint a neutral mediator upon written request to the AAA by either party. 
 (iii) In the event the Company and Executive are unable to resolve any Dispute pursuant to Article V.B.(i) or (ii) above, the parties hereto shall resolve such Dispute by binding arbitration under the Employment Arbitration rules of the AAA then in effect, and in accordance with applicable law, including the Federal Arbitration Act and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, but subject to the following agreed provisions and except where applicable federal or state law requires otherwise. Subject to legal privileges, the arbitrator shall have the power to permit discovery as allowed under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The arbitration shall be conducted in Dallas, Texas, and the proceedings shall be kept strictly confidential by the parties, their respective attorneys and the arbitrator. Notice of papers or processes relating to any arbitration proceeding, or for the confirmation of award and entry of judgment on an award may be served on each of the parties by registered or certified mail. The arbitrator shall be selected by agreement of the parties but if no agreement can be reached, the arbitrator shall be appointed pursuant to the procedures of the AAA. The Company shall pay the arbitrator s expenses. Each party shall pay its own legal expenses, except where prohibited by law. The arbitrator shall have no authority to consolidate the claims of other employees into a class action or otherwise fashion, consider, preside over, or award relief to any form of a representative, collective, or class proceeding. The arbitrator shall provide a written opinion supporting his her conclusions, including detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law. Such findings of fact shall be final and binding on the parties. The arbitrator may award 
 22 

damages and or permanent injunctive relief, but in no event shall the arbitrator have the authority to award punitive or exemplary damages, except where authorized by statute. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article V , the Company may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the covenants set forth in Article IV . If proper notice of any hearing has been given, the arbitrator shall have full power to proceed to take evidence or to perform any other acts necessary to arbitrate the matter in the absence of any party who fails to appear. If any portion of this Agreement is at any time deemed to be in conflict with any applicable statute, rule, regulation or ordinance, such portion shall be deemed to be modified or altered to conform thereto or, if that is not possible, to be omitted from this Agreement, and the invalidity of any such portion shall not affect the force, effect and validity of the remaining portion hereof.

 G. Entire Agreement . This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the Parties, and fully supersedes any and all prior agreements, understanding or representations among the Parties pertaining to or concerning the subject matter of this Agreement, including, without limitation, Executive s Employment Agreement with the Company dated as of October 25, 2020 and Executive s Amended and Restated Employment Agreement with the Company dated as of January 23, 2023. No oral statements or prior written material not specifically incorporated in this Agreement shall be of any force and effect, and no changes in or additions to this Agreement shall be recognized, unless incorporated in this Agreement by written amendment, such amendment to become effective on the date stipulated in it. Any amendment to this Agreement must be in writing and must be signed by all parties to this Agreement. 
 H. Disclaimer of Reliance .

Executive represents that Executive relied solely and only on Executive s own judgment in making the decision to enter into this Agreement. 
 I. No Fiduciary Relationship by the Company . This Agreement does not create, nor shall it be construed as creating, any principal and agent, trust, or other fiduciary duty or special relationship running from the Company (or any of its officers or directors) to Executive. 
 J. Waiver . No waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall be construed to be a waiver as to succeeding breaches. The failure of any Party to insist in any one or more instances upon performance of any terms or conditions of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of future performance of any such term, covenant or condition but the obligations of the Parties with respect thereto shall continue in full force and effect.

 24 

this Agreement shall not preclude equitable relief, injunctive relief, damages or the obligations in Article IV .

Except as provided in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement entitles any person other than the Parties to the Agreement to any claim, cause of action, remedy, or right of any kind. 
 M. Section 409A . This Agreement is intended to be interpreted and applied so that the payments and benefits set forth herein shall either be exempt from the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, or shall comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. To the extent any provision of this Agreement is or becomes not exempt from or not in compliance with Section 409A of the Code, Executive and the Company shall work together in good faith to amend this Agreement such that it is exempt from or complies with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, while maintaining the intended economic benefit of this Agreement to the extent possible. In no event may Executive, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of any payment to be made under this Agreement or otherwise which constitutes a deferral of compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or elsewhere to the contrary, a termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of any provision of this Agreement providing for the payment of any amounts or benefits that constitute non-qualified deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code upon or following a termination of Executive s employment unless such termination is also a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and, for purposes of any such provision of this Agreement, references to a termination, termination of employment or like terms shall mean separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement or elsewhere to the contrary, if on Executive s termination of employment, Executive is deemed to be a specified employee within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, any payments or benefits due upon a termination of Executive s employment under any arrangement that constitutes a deferral of compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code (whether under this Agreement, any other plan, program, payroll practice or any equity grant) and which do not otherwise qualify under the exemptions under Treasury Regulation Section l .409A-1 (including without limitation, the short-term deferral exemption and the permitted payments under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-l(b)(9)(iii)(A)), shall be delayed and paid or provided to Executive in a lump sum (whether they would have otherwise been payable in a single sum or in installments in the absence of such delay) on the earlier of (x) the date which is six months and one day after Executive s separation 
 25 

from service for any reason other than death, and (y) the date of Executive s death, and any remaining payments and benefits shall be paid or provided in accordance with the normal payment dates specified for such payment or benefit. With respect to any expense reimbursement benefit provided pursuant to this Agreement, (1) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement provided to Executive during any calendar year shall not affect the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement provided to Executive in any other calendar year, (2) the reimbursements for expenses for which Executive is entitled to be reimbursed shall be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the applicable expense is incurred, and (3) the right to payment or reimbursement hereunder may not be liquidated or exchanged for any other benefit. Each payment under this Agreement to Executive shall be deemed a separate payment. To the extent the benefits provided under Article III.B. ii or Article III.C. ii are otherwise taxable to Executive, such benefits, for purposes of Section 409A of the Code shall be provided as separate monthly in-kind payments of those benefits, and to the extent those benefits are subject to and not otherwise excepted from Section 409A of the Code, the provision of the in-kind benefits during one calendar year shall not affect the in-kind benefits to be provided in any other calendar year. 
 N. Further Acts . Whether or not specifically required under the terms of this Agreement, each party shall execute and deliver such documents and take such further actions as shall be necessary in order for such party to perform all of his or its obligations specified in the Agreement or reasonably implied from the Agreement s terms. 
 O. Publicity and Advertising . Executive agrees that the Company may use his name, picture, or likeness for any advertising, publicity or other business purpose at any time, during the term of this Agreement and may continue to use materials generated during the term of this Agreement for a period of six months thereafter. The use of Executive s name, picture, or likeness shall not be deemed to result in any invasion of Executive s privacy or in violation of any property right Executive may have and Executive shall receive no additional consideration if his name, picture or likeness is so used. Executive further agrees that any negatives, prints or other material for printing or reproduction purposes prepared in connection with the use of his name, picture or likeness by the Company shall be and are the sole property of the Company. 
 P. Indemnification . The Company agrees that it shall indemnify and hold harmless Executive to the fullest extent permitted by Texas law from and against any and all liabilities, costs, claims and expenses including without limitation all costs and expenses incurred in defense of litigation, including attorneys fees, arising out of the employment of Executive hereunder, except to the extent arising out of or based upon the willful misconduct, fraud, or gross negligence of Executive. Costs and expenses incurred by Executive in defense of any such litigation, including attorneys fees, shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such litigation promptly upon receipt by the Company of (i) a written request for payment, (ii) appropriate documentation evidencing the incurrence, amount and nature of the costs and expenses for which payment is being sought, and (iii) an undertaking adequate under Texas law made by or on behalf of Executive to repay the amounts so paid if it shall ultimately be determined that Executive is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company under this Agreement. THE FOREGOING INDEMNIFICATION SPECIFICALLY INCLUDES CLAIMS 
 26 

THAT ARISE OUT OF EXECUTIVE S SOLE, JOINT OR CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE, BUT SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDES THOSE CLAIMS THAT ARISE OUT OF EXECUTIVE S WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, FRAUD OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE. EXECUTIVE WOULD NOT HAVE ENTERED INTO THIS AGREEMENT IF NOT FOR THIS INDEMNIFICATION. The Company further agrees to maintain customary directors and officers liability insurance policies, under which Executive shall be covered, at levels no less favorable than other directors and officers are covered. 
 Q. Withholding Taxes . The Company may withhold from any amounts or benefits payable under this Agreement income taxes and payroll taxes that are required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation. 
 R. Federal Deposit Insurance Act Compliance . Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company will not be obligated to make any payment hereunder that would be prohibited as a golden parachute payment or indemnification payment under Section 18(k) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. 
 S. Legal Fees . The Company will pay directly to Executive s attorney, for the reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by Executive in connection with the negotiation and preparation of this Agreement and any related documents, an amount not to exceed 50,000, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date hereof. 
 T. Execution in Multiple Counterparts . This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, whether or not all signatories appear on these counterparts, and each counterpart shall be deemed an original for all purposes.
