Presentation of Financial, Market and Industry Data 
 We present our financial information on a consolidated basis. Unless otherwise noted, when we refer to dollars, we mean U.S. dollars. 
 Certain market and industry data included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024 (the Report has been obtained or derived from third-party sources that we believe to be reliable. Market estimates are calculated by using independent industry publications, government publications and third-party forecasts in conjunction with our assumptions about our markets. We cannot guarantee the accuracy or completeness of this market and market share data and have not independently verified it. None of the sources consented to the disclosure or use of data in this Report. While we are not aware of any misstatements regarding any market, industry or similar data presented herein, such data involves risks and uncertainties and is subject to change based on various factors, including those discussed under the headings Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in this Report and Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February 14, 2024. 
 Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Report may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, the proposed Transactions, short-term and long-term liquidity, expectations regarding the effect of the Transactions, financial projections, plans and objectives of management for future operations, and future economic performance. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements we make regarding future estimated volume, pricing and revenue, anticipated levels of capital expenditures and cost of goods sold, anticipated reduction in our costs resulting from our cost rationalization initiatives and one-time costs of implementation and guidance relating to adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. You can identify these forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking words such as will, may, plan, estimate, project, believe, anticipate, expect, foresee, intend, should, would, could, target, goal, continue to, positioned to, are confident, or the negative versions of those words or other comparable words. Any forward-looking statements contained in this Report are based upon our historical performance and on our current plans, estimates and expectations considering information currently available to us. The inclusion of this forward-looking information should not be regarded as a representation by us that the future plans, estimates, or expectations contemplated by us will be achieved. Our expectations and targets are not predictions of actual performance and historically our performance has

Table of Contents 

 deviated, often significantly, from our expectations and targets. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties and assumptions relating to our operations, financial results, financial condition, business, prospects, growth strategy and liquidity. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these statements. We believe that these factors include, but are not limited to: 
 our dependence on the global steel industry generally and the electric arc furnace EAF steel industry in particular; 
 the cyclical nature of our business and the selling prices of our products, which may continue to decline in the future, and may lead to prolonged periods of reduced profitability and net losses or adversely impact liquidity; 
 the sensitivity of our business and operating results to economic conditions, including any recession, and the possibility others may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion or at all; 
 the possibility that we may be unable to implement our business strategies in an effective manner; 
 the possibility that global graphite electrode overcapacity may adversely affect graphite electrode prices; 
 the competitiveness of the graphite electrode industry; 
 our dependence on the supply of raw materials, including decant oil and petroleum needle coke, and disruptions in supply chains for these materials; 
 our primary reliance on one facility in Monterrey, Mexico for the manufacturing of connecting pins; 
 the cost of electric power and natural gas, particularly in Europe; 
 our manufacturing operations are subject to hazards; 
 the legal, compliance, economic, social and political risks associated with our substantial operations in multiple countries; 
 the possibility that fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates could materially harm our financial results; 
 the possibility that our results of operations could further deteriorate if our manufacturing operations were substantially disrupted for an extended period, including as a result of equipment failure, climate change, regulatory issues, natural disasters, public health crises, such as a global pandemic, political crises or other catastrophic events; 
 the risks and uncertainties associated with litigation, arbitration, and like disputes, including disputes related to contractual commitments; 
 our dependence on third parties for certain construction, maintenance, engineering, transportation, warehousing and logistics services; 
 the possibility that we are subject to information technology systems failures, cybersecurity attacks, network disruptions and breaches of data security; 
 the possibility that we are unable to recruit or retain key management and plant operating personnel or successfully negotiate with the representatives of our employees, including labor unions; 
 the sensitivity of long-lived assets on our balance sheet to changes in the market; 
 our dependence on protecting our intellectual property and the possibility that third parties may claim that our products or processes infringe their intellectual property rights; 
 the impact of inflation and our ability to mitigate the effect on our costs; 
 the impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical events on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and the disruptions and inefficiencies in our supply chain that may occur as a result of such events; 
 the possibility that our indebtedness could limit our financial and operating activities or that our cash flows may not be sufficient to service our indebtedness; 
 past increases in benchmark interest rates and the fact that any future borrowings may subject us to interest rate risk; 
 risks and uncertainties associated with our ability to access the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition; 
 3 

Table of Contents 

 the possibility that disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our customers and suppliers; 
 the possibility that restrictive covenants in our financing agreements could restrict or limit our operations; 
 changes in, or more stringent enforcement of, health, safety and environmental regulations applicable to our manufacturing operations and facilities; 
 the possibility that the cash dividends on our common stock, which are currently suspended, will remain suspended and we may not pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future; and 
 our ability to continue to meet NYSE continued listing standards. 
 These factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the Risk Factors and other cautionary statements that are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). Additionally, there can be no assurances that the Transactions will be successfully consummated as they remain subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent. The forward-looking statements made in this Report relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made. Except as required by law, we do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. 
 If one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from what we may have expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. We caution that you should not place undue reliance on any of our forward-looking statements. You should specifically consider the factors identified in this Report that could cause actual results to differ before making an investment decision to purchase our common stock. Furthermore, new risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is impossible for us to predict those events or how they may affect us.

 Graphite Electrodes - Non-LTAs By-products and other Total Revenues 
 Contract Balances 
 Substantially all of the Company s receivables relate to contracts with customers. Accounts receivables are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Payment terms on invoices range from to days depending on the customary business practices of the jurisdictions in which we do business. 
 Certain short-term and longer-term sales contracts require up-front payments prior to the Company s fulfillment of any performance obligation. These contract liabilities are recorded as current or long-term deferred revenue, depending on the lag between the pre-payment and the expected delivery of the related products. Additionally, deferred revenue or contract assets originate from contracts where the allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices results in the timing of revenue recognition being different from the timing of the invoicing. In this case, deferred revenue is amortized into revenue based on the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations and contract assets are realized through the contract invoicing. 
 We did have any contract asset balances as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 
 The amount of revenue recognized in the first nine months of 2024 that was included in the December 31, 2023 current deferred revenue balance was million. The decrease in the current deferred revenue balance since December 31, 2023 is primarily due to revenue recognized in the current year, partially offset by customer prepayments. 
 Transaction Price Allocated to the Remaining Performance Obligations 
 The following table presents estimated revenues expected to be recognized in the corresponding period below related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) at the end of reporting period.

 The remaining LTAs are defined as pre-determined fixed annual volume contracts. The actual revenue realized from these contracted volumes may vary in timing and total due to contract non-performance, force majeure notices and credit risk associated with certain customers facing financial challenges.

GrafTech Finance Inc. GrafTech Finance was the sole borrower under the 2018 Term Loan Facility while GrafTech Finance, GrafTech Switzerland SA Swissco and GrafTech Luxembourg II S. r.l. Luxembourg Holdco and, together with GrafTech Finance and Swissco, the Co-Borrowers are co-borrowers under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility. The 2018 Revolving Credit Facility matures on May 31, 2027. The net proceeds from the 2023 Senior Secured Notes (as defined below) were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our 2018 Term Loan Facility. The availability under our 2018 Revolving Credit Facility was million as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As any borrowings under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility remain subject to compliance with the financial covenant thereunder, our operating performance as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 resulted in a reduction of the availability under the facility. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were borrowings outstanding on the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility and there was million of letters of credit drawn against the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility as of each date. 
 The 2018 Revolving Credit Facility bears interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either (i) the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate and Adjusted EURIBOR Rate (each, as defined in the 2018 Credit Agreement), plus an applicable margin initially equal to per annum or (ii) the ABR Rate, plus an applicable margin initially equal to per annum, in each case with two basis point step downs based on achievement of certain senior secured first lien net leverage ratios. In addition, we are required to pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unused commitments under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility in an amount equal to per annum. 
 The 2018 Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by each of our domestic subsidiaries, subject to certain customary exceptions, and by GrafTech Luxembourg I S. r.l., a Luxembourg soci t responsabilit limit e and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of GrafTech, Luxembourg HoldCo, and Swissco (collectively, the Guarantors with respect to all obligations under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility of each of our foreign subsidiaries that is a Controlled Foreign Corporation (within the meaning of Section 956 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time (the Code )). 
 Any obligations under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility are secured, subject to certain exceptions, by: (i) a pledge of all of the equity securities of each domestic Guarantor and of each other direct, wholly owned domestic subsidiary of GrafTech and any Guarantor, (ii) a pledge on no more than of the equity interests of each subsidiary that is a Controlled Foreign Corporation (within the meaning of Section 956 of the Code), and (iii) security interests in, and mortgages on, personal property and material real property of each domestic Guarantor, subject to permitted liens and certain exceptions specified in the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility. The obligations of each foreign subsidiary of GrafTech that is a Controlled Foreign Corporation under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility are secured by (i) a pledge of no more than 65 of the equity securities of each Guarantor that is a Controlled Foreign Corporation and of each direct, wholly owned subsidiary of any Guarantor that is a Controlled Foreign Corporation, and (ii) security interests in certain receivables and personal property of each Guarantor that is a Controlled Foreign Corporation, subject to permitted liens and certain exceptions specified in the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility. 
 The 2018 Revolving Credit Facility contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants applicable to GrafTech and restricted subsidiaries, including, among other things, restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments, fundamental changes, dispositions, and dividends and other distributions. The 2018 Revolving Credit Facility contains a financial covenant that requires GrafTech to maintain a senior secured first lien net leverage ratio not greater than to 1.00 when the aggregate principal amount of borrowings under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility and outstanding letters of credit issued under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility (except for undrawn letters of credit in an aggregate amount equal to or less than million), taken together, exceed of the total amount of commitments under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility. The 2018 Revolving Credit Facility also contains customary events of default. We were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

All of the net proceeds from the 2020 Senior Secured Notes were used to partially repay borrowings under our 2018 Term Loan Facility. 
 The 2020 Senior Secured Notes pay interest in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, with the principal due in full on December 15, 2028. The 2020 Senior Secured Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at various prices depending on the date redeemed.

 2023 Senior Secured Notes 
 In June 2023, GrafTech Global Enterprises Inc. issued million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2028 (the 2023 Senior Secured Notes ), including million of original issue discount. The 2023 Senior Secured Notes were issued at an issue price of of the principal amount thereof in a private offering. The 2023 Senior Secured Notes and related guarantees are secured on a pari passu basis by the collateral securing the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility and the 2020 Senior Secured Notes.

 Brazil Clause IV 
 Pending litigation in Brazil has been brought by employees seeking to recover additional amounts and interest thereon under certain wage increase provisions applicable in 1989 and 1990 under collective bargaining agreements to which employers in the Bahia region of Brazil were a party (including our subsidiary in Brazil). Companies in Brazil have settled claims arising out of these provisions and, in May 2015, the litigation was remanded by the Brazilian Supreme Court in favor of the employees union. After denying an interim appeal by the Bahia region employers on June 26, 2019, the Brazilian Supreme Court finally ruled in favor of the employees union on September 26, 2019. The employers union has determined not to seek annulment of such decision. Separately, on October 1, 2015, a related action was filed by current and former employees against our subsidiary in Brazil to recover amounts under such provisions, plus interest thereon, which amounts together with interest could be material to us. If the Brazilian Supreme Court proceeding above had been determined in favor of the employers union, it would also have resolved this proceeding in our favor. In the first quarter of 2017, the state court initially ruled in favor of the employees. We appealed this state court ruling, and the appellate court issued a decision in our favor on May 19, 2020. The employees have further appealed and, on December 16, 2020, the court upheld the decision in favor of GrafTech Brazil. On

In addition, we will pay interest on the payments we will make to Brookfield with respect to the amount of these cash savings from the due date (without extensions) of our tax return where we realize these savings to the payment date. On April 10, 2023, the Tax Receivable Agreement was amended and restated to change the applicable interest rate from LIBOR plus per year to the one-month period secured overnight financing rate administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York plus . The term of the Tax Receivable Agreement commenced on April 23, 2018 and will continue until there is no potential for any future tax benefit payments.

 Mexico Value-Added Tax VAT 
 In July 2019, the Mexican Tax Authority MTA opened an audit of the VAT filings of GrafTech Comercial de Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V. GrafTech Commercial Mexico for the period of January 1 to April 30, 2019. In September 2021, the MTA issued a tax assessment, claiming improper use of a certain VAT exemption rule for purchases from a foreign affiliate. As of September 30, 2024, the tax assessment for the four month period under audit amounted to approximately million, including penalties, inflation and interest. Interest will continue to accrue up to five years from the date the

million, including penalties, inflation and interest. Interest would continue to accrue up to five years from the date the corresponding VAT returns were filed and inflation would continue to accrue with the passage of time. In Mexico, each tax assessment requires a separate claim. In the first quarter of 2023, GrafTech Commercial Mexico requested a conclusive agreement with the Mexican ombudsman PRODECON to reach a settlement with the MTA. The MTA responded to GrafTech Commercial Mexico s request on May 30, 2023. On August 2, 2023, GrafTech Commercial Mexico filed a motion exhibiting additional information and reaffirming its position. On September 22, 2023, the MTA responded to GrafTech Commercial Mexico s motion. On October 2, 2023, GrafTech Commercial Mexico filed a motion requesting a formal meeting with the MTA and PRODECON, which occurred on November 14, 2023. During the meeting, the parties agreed that GrafTech Commercial Mexico will provide additional documentation and information to be evaluated by the MTA, and, on November 29, 2023, GrafTech Commercial Mexico filed the information requested. On January 24, 2024, the MTA filed its response. On that same day, GrafTech Commercial Mexico submitted before PRODECON the favorable ruling it obtained on January 8, 2024 in connection with the 2019 proceeding for the MTA s consideration. On February 1, 2024, the MTA confirmed its position, holding that GrafTech Commercial Mexico was required to withhold the VAT. On March 20, 2024, a meeting was held at PRODECON where the parties confirmed their final positions. No agreement between the parties was reached, the conclusive agreement procedure came to an end, and the tax audit process resumed. On July 10, 2024, the MTA concluded the tax audit and determined that there is no tax deficiency to be assessed for the period January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018. 
 As evidenced by the favorable court decision issued on January 8, 2024 with respect to the 2019 proceeding and the MTA s conclusion of the tax audit for the 2018 proceeding, GrafTech Commercial Mexico s application of the VAT exemption rules is appropriate and, accordingly, GrafTech Commercial Mexico does not believe that it is probable that it will incur a loss related to this matter for the 2019 proceeding under the MTA s audit. The Company intends to vigorously defend its position in the 2019 proceeding. 
 Brazil Income Tax Audit 
 On October 23, 2024, GrafTech Brasil Participa es Ltda. received an income tax assessment notice from the Brazilian Internal Revenue Service IRS totaling approximately million including approximately million of interest and penalties, resulting from an audit carried out between 2023 and 2024, related to the period from 2019 to 2020. In this assessment, two issues were raised by the tax auditor. The first item disallowed the investment tax incentive (75 reduction of income tax), under the allegation that the Company did not have a negative tax debt certificate. The second disallowed the use of the VAT benefit (called Desenvolve) to increase the investment tax incentive. The Company believes that the IRS assessment is incorrect and does not believe that it is probable that it will incur a loss related to these matters. The Company intends to vigorously defend its position regarding both items.

 The effective tax rate for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 and 2023 was different than the U.S. statutory tax rate of primarily due to the mix of U.S. and foreign earnings, tax incentives and provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ). 
 We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state and foreign jurisdictions. All U.S. federal tax years prior to 2020 are generally closed by statute or have been audited and settled with the applicable domestic tax authorities. Other jurisdictions are generally closed for years prior to 2018. 
 We continue to assess the realization of our deferred tax assets based on determinations of whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax benefits will be realized through the generation of future taxable income. Appropriate consideration is given to all available evidence, both positive and negative, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. Examples of positive evidence would include a strong earnings history, an event or events that would increase our taxable income through a continued reduction of expenses, and tax planning strategies that would indicate an ability to realize deferred tax assets. In circumstances where the significant positive evidence does not outweigh the negative evidence in regards to whether or not a valuation allowance is required, we have established and maintained valuation allowances on those net deferred tax assets. There were no material changes to our valuation allowances in the first nine months of 2024.

, which could be lowered to depending on credit ratings. Since their modification concurrent with the 2018 Term Loan Facility modification in the first quarter of 2021, the swaps contained an other-than-insignificant financing element. As such, they were considered hybrid instruments composed of a debt host and an embedded derivative and the associated cash (outflows)/inflows are classified as financing (use)/source of cash. The embedded derivative is treated as a cash-flow hedge. 
 In the first quarter of 2022, in connection with the partial repayment of principal on our 2018 Term Loan Facility and our probability assessment of the variable-rate debt remaining outstanding through the term of the swaps, we de-designated one interest rate swap contract with a million notional amount, that matured in the third quarter of 2024. The fair value of the embedded derivative at the de-designation date was a gain of million and was recorded in AOCL and was amortized into interest expense over the remaining life of the swap. 
 In the third quarter of 2022, we redeemed million of our million notional amount de-designated interest rate swap. The change in fair value of the de-designated embedded derivative in the first nine months of 2023 resulted in a loss of million, and was recorded in interest expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 In the second quarter of 2023, in connection with the repayment of the million outstanding balance on our 2018 Term Loan Facility, we terminated our million notional de-designated interest rate swap and our million notional designated interest rate swap and received net cash of million. The net cash received included a million gain on the embedded derivatives, partially offset by a million loss on the settlement of our debt host liability as of the termination date. The loss related to the settlement of the debt host liability was amortized into interest expense using the effective interest method through August 2024. 
 Out of the million gain on the embedded derivatives, million for the de-designated swap was recorded in interest expense and million for the designated swap was recorded in AOCL and was amortized into interest expense using the effective interest method through August 2024. 
 All derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. If the derivative is designated and effective as a cash flow hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in AOCL until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of a derivative's fair value, if any, is recognized in earnings immediately. If a derivative is not a hedge, changes in the fair value are adjusted through earnings. The fair values of the outstanding derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet as assets (if the derivatives are in a gain position) or liabilities (if the derivatives are in a loss position). The fair values will also be classified as short-term or long-term depending upon their maturity dates. The fair value of all of our derivatives was determined using Level 2 inputs.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The Company 
 We are a leading manufacturer of high-quality graphite electrode products essential to the production of EAF steel and other ferrous and non ferrous metals. We believe that we have the most competitive portfolio of low cost ultra-high power graphite electrode manufacturing facilities in the industry, with some of the highest capacity facilities in the world. We are the only large scale graphite electrode producer that is substantially vertically integrated into petroleum needle coke, our key raw material for graphite electrode manufacturing. 
 The environmental and economic advantages of EAF steel production position both that industry and the graphite electrode industry for long-term growth. 
 We believe GrafTech s leadership position and vertical integration are sustainable competitive advantages. The services and solutions we provide will position our customers and us for a better future. 
 Operational and Commercial Update 
 Sales volume for the third quarter of 2024 was 26.4 thousand metric tons MT ), consisting of 23.4 thousand MT of non-LTA volume and 3.0 thousand MT of LTA volume, and increased 9 compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 For the third quarter of 2024, the weighted-average realized price for our non-LTA volume was approximately 4,100 per MT, a decrease of 24 compared to the third quarter of 2023, with the decline reflecting the persistent competitive pressures in the regions in which we operate. For our LTA volume, the weighted-average realized price was approximately 7,700 per MT for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 8,650 in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Production volume was 19.4 thousand MT in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 15 compared to the third quarter of 2023. The decline primarily reflected extended production shutdowns at our European graphite electrode manufacturing facilities during the third quarter of 2024, as was planned. 
 Management Changes 
 On August 13, 2024, the Company s Board of Directors (the Board appointed Rory O Donnell to serve as Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President, effective as of September 3, 2024. Catherine Hedoux-Delgado, who served as the Company s Interim Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer through September 2, 2024, has been serving as Vice President, Controller, since September 3, 2024. 
 Cost Rationalization and Footprint Optimization Plan Announced in February 2024 
 In the first quarter of 2024, we announced a set of initiatives designed to reduce our cost structure and optimize our manufacturing footprint. As part of these initiatives, we indefinitely suspended production activities at our St. Marys, Pennsylvania facility, with the exception of graphite electrode and pin machining. In addition, we indefinitely idled certain assets within our remaining graphite electrode manufacturing footprint. As a result, our graphite electrode production capacity has been reduced to approximately 178 thousand MT in 2024. In parallel, we adopted measures for additional overhead reductions to reduce our selling and administrative expenses. Collectively, these initiatives resulted in a reduction of our global headcount by approximately 130 employees, or 10 of our workforce. We continue to expect these initiatives will result in annualized cost savings of approximately 25.0 million, excluding the impact of one-time costs. Of the anticipated annualized cost savings, approximately 15.0 million are expected to be realized in cost of goods sold with the remainder in selling and administrative expenses. 
 Rationalization charges of 3.2 million related to severance and contract terminations will be paid in cash and we expect the substantial majority to be paid by the end of the second quarter of 2025. Rationalization-related charges of 2.7 million represent the non-cash write-off of inventory and fixed assets. Substantially all charges relative to this plan were recorded during the first quarter of 2024 and wind-down activities were completed at the end of the second quarter of 2024.

Outlook 
 We expect demand for graphite electrodes in the near term will remain weak, reflecting persistent challenges in the commercial environment as steel industry production remains constrained by global economic uncertainty. Given these trends, challenging pricing dynamics have persisted in most regions. As a result, we remain selective in the commercial opportunities we choose to pursue. Despite these headwinds, we expect a low double-digit percentage point year-over-year improvement in sales volume for the full year of 2024. Sales volume in the fourth quarter of 2024 is expected to be broadly in line with sales volume for the third quarter of 2024. For 2025, we expect another year of low double-digit percentage point sales volume growth. This performance reflects our compelling customer value proposition and our ongoing focus on delivering on the needs of our customers. 
 As it relates to costs, we now expect the year-over-year decline in our full-year 2024 cash cost of goods sold per MT to exceed our previous guidance of a mid-teen percentage point decline compared to 2023. Reflecting the continued progress we are making on our cost structure, we now anticipate a decline of approximately 20 for the full-year of 2024, compared to 2023, and we anticipate a further improvement in 2025. The significant improvement in our cost structure reflects (1) the deliberate actions we have taken to reduce our fixed manufacturing costs, (2) the benefit of additional actions we are taking to reduce our variable costs and (3) the anticipated year-over-year improvement in our sales and production volume levels. In addition, we continue to closely manage our working capital levels and capital expenditures. For 2024, we now expect the net impact of working capital will be favorable to our full-year cash flow performance. We continue to anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of 35 million to 40 million. 
 Longer term, we remain confident that the steel industry s accelerating efforts to decarbonize will lead to increased adoption of the electric arc furnace method of steelmaking, driving long-term demand growth for graphite electrodes. We also anticipate the demand for petroleum needle coke, the key raw material we use to produce graphite electrodes, to accelerate driven by its utilization in producing synthetic graphite for use in lithium-ion batteries for the growing electric vehicle market. We believe that the near-term actions we are taking, supported by an industry-leading position and our sustainable competitive advantages, including our substantial vertical integration into petroleum needle coke via our Seadrift facility, will optimally position GrafTech to benefit from that long-term growth. 
 
 The table of estimated shipments of graphite electrodes under existing LTAs is as follows, reflecting our current expectations for the full year 2024: 2024 Outlook Estimated LTA volume (1) 
 13-14 Estimated LTA revenue (2) 
 110- 120 (3) 
 
 (1) In thousands of MT 
 (2) In millions 
 (3) Estimated LTA revenue includes payments from customers that failed to meet certain obligations under their LTAs 
 
 We recorded 9.9 thousand MT of LTA volume and 85.4 million of LTA revenue in the first nine months of 2024 and we expect to record three thousand to four thousand MT of LTA volume and approximately 24.6 million to 34.6 million of LTA revenue for the remainder of 2024. 
 The remaining LTAs are defined as pre-determined fixed annual volume contracts. The actual revenue realized from these contracted volumes may vary in timing and total due to contract non-performance, force majeure notices and credit risk associated with certain customers facing financial challenges. 
 Capital Structure and Liquidity 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had liquidity of 253.8 million, consisting of cash and cash equivalents of 141.4 million and 112.4 million of availability under our 2018 Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, we had gross debt of 950.1 million. 
 
 Key metrics used by management to measure performance 
 In addition to measures of financial performance presented in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP ), we use certain other financial measures and operating metrics to analyze the performance of our Company. Our non-GAAP financial measures consist of

 Key operating measures 
 In addition to measures of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP, we use certain operating metrics to analyze the performance of our Company. These metrics align with management's assessment of our revenue performance and profit margin, and will help investors understand the factors that drive our profitability. 
 Sales volume reflects the total volume of graphite electrodes sold for which revenue has been recognized during the period. For a discussion of our revenue recognition policy, see Critical accounting policies Revenue recognition in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Sales volume helps investors understand the factors that drive our net sales. 
 Production volume, production capacity and capacity utilization help us understand the efficiency of our production, evaluate cost of goods sold and consider how to approach our sales contract initiative.

 (1) Production volume reflects graphite electrodes we produced during the period. 
 (2) Production capacity reflects expected maximum production volume during the period depending on product mix and expected maintenance outage. Actual production may vary. 
 (3) Includes graphite electrode facilities in Calais, France; Monterrey, Mexico; and Pamplona, Spain. While maintaining the capability to produce up to 28,000 MT of graphite electrodes and pins on an annual basis at our St. Marys, Pennsylvania facility, most production activities at St. Marys have been suspended. The wind down of these production activities was completed during the second quarter of 2024. Remaining activities at St. Marys are limited to machining graphite electrodes and pins sourced from our other plants. 
 (4) Capacity utilization reflects production volume as a percentage of production capacity.

Results of Operations 
 The Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 The table presented in our period-over-period comparisons summarizes our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and illustrates key financial indicators used to assess the consolidated financial results. Throughout this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Report MD A ), insignificant changes may be deemed not meaningful and are generally excluded from the discussion.

 NM = Not Meaningful. 
 Net sales decreased 28.3 million, or 18 , compared to the third quarter of 2023. The decline primarily reflected a decrease in the weighted-average realized price for volume derived from non-LTAs and a shift in the mix of our business from volume derived from LTAs to volume derived from non-LTAs. These factors were partially offset by higher overall sales volume. 
 Cost of goods sold decreased 22.7 million, or 14 , compared to the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the 15.7 million reduction of fixed manufacturing costs, that would have otherwise been inventoried, recorded in the third quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter of 2023. Also, the LCM inventory valuation adjustments recorded at December 31, 2023 and in the first six months of 2024 generated a 2.9 million favorable impact to cost of goods sold in the third quarter of 2024. These decreases were partially offset by the impact of increased volume. 
 LCM inventory valuation adjustment represents an adjustment to inventory recorded in the third quarter of 2024. The net realizable value of certain of our inventories fell below their carrying amounts as of September 30, 2024, and as a result, we recorded a LCM inventory valuation adjustment of 7.8 million in order to state our inventories at market, as required by U.S. GAAP. 
 Selling and administrative expenses decreased 5.2 million, or 28 , compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to decreased employee-related expenses driven by our cost rationalization and footprint optimization plan announced in February 2024, as well as reduced variable compensation expenses. 
 Interest expense increased 0.8 million, or 5 , compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to a reduction in the amount of gains recognized related to our interest rate swaps that were terminated in the second quarter of 2023. See Note 6, Interest Expense in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

 The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 was different than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21 primarily due to the mix of U.S. and foreign earnings, tax incentives and provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ).

 NM = Not Meaningful. 
 Net sales decreased 78.8 million, or 16 , compared to the first nine months of 2023. The decline primarily reflected a decrease in the weighted-average realized price for volume derived from non-LTAs and a shift in the mix of our business from volume derived from LTAs to volume derived from non-LTAs. These factors were partially offset by a 13 increase in total sales volume in the first nine months of 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Cost of goods sold decreased 25.4 million, or 6 , compared to the first nine months of 2023, primarily due to the 29.6 million reduction of fixed manufacturing costs recorded in the first nine months of 2024, compared to the first nine months of 2023, that would have otherwise been inventoried. Also, the LCM inventory valuation adjustment recorded at December 31, 2023 and in the first six months of 2024 generated a 14.1 million favorable impact to cost of goods sold in the first nine months of 2024. These decreases were partially offset by the impact of increased volume.

LCM inventory valuation adjustment represents an adjustment to inventory recorded in the first nine months of 2024. The net realizable value of certain of our inventories fell below their carrying amounts in the first nine months of 2024, and as a result, we recorded a LCM inventory valuation adjustment of 11.9 million in order to state our inventories at market. 
 Selling and administrative expenses decreased 25.5 million, or 43 , compared to the first nine months of 2023, primarily due to the 9.2 million reimbursement of legal fees in connection with the favorable outcome of an arbitration, as well as decreased selling and variable compensation expenses. See Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 
 Rationalization expenses represent severance and contract termination costs related to the cost rationalization and footprint optimization plan announced in February 2024. See Note 14, Rationalization Expenses in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 
 Interest expense increased 5.3 million, or 13 , compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to higher interest incurred on debt associated with our 2023 Senior Secured Notes that carry a fixed interest rate of 9.875 , partially offset by an increase of net gains recognized related to our interest rate swaps that were terminated in the second quarter of 2023. See Note 6, Interest Expense in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

 The income tax benefit decreased in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 due to the mix of U.S. and foreign earnings, tax incentives and provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 
 
 Effects of Changes in Currency Exchange Rates 
 When the currencies of non-U.S. countries in which we have a manufacturing facility decline (or increase) in value relative to the U.S. dollar, this has the effect of reducing (or increasing) the U.S. dollar equivalent cost of goods sold and other expenses with respect to those facilities. In certain countries in which we have manufacturing facilities, and in certain export markets, we sell in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, when these currencies increase (or decline) in value relative to the U.S. dollar, this has the effect of increasing (or reducing) net sales. The result of these effects is to increase (or decrease) operating and net loss. 
 Many of the non-U.S. countries in which we have a manufacturing facility have been subject to significant economic and political changes, which have significantly impacted currency exchange rates. We cannot predict changes in currency exchange rates in the future or whether those changes will have net positive or negative impacts on our net sales, cost of goods sold or net loss. 
 The impact of these changes in the average exchange rates of other currencies against the U.S. dollar on our net sales was an increase of 0.1 million for the third quarter of 2024 and a decrease of 0.7 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to the same periods of 2023. The impact of these changes on our cost of goods sold was decreases of 5.1 million and 6.9 million for the third quarter of 2024 and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2023. 
 We have in the past and may in the future use various financial instruments to manage certain exposures to risks caused by currency exchange rate changes, as described under Part I, Item 3., Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our sources of funds have consisted principally of cash flow from operations and debt, including our credit facilities (subject to continued compliance with the financial covenants and representations). Our uses of those funds (other than for operations) have consisted principally of capital expenditures, debt repayment, dividends, share repurchases and other general purposes. On an ongoing basis, we expect to evaluate and consider strategic transactions, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, equity investments, debt issuances, refinancing our existing debt or repurchases of our outstanding debt obligations in open market or privately negotiated transactions, as well as other strategic transactions. These transactions may require cash expenditures, which may be funded through a combination of cash on hand, proceeds from the issuance of debt or from equity offerings. Disruptions in the U.S. and international financial markets could adversely affect our liquidity and the cost and availability of financing to us in the future. 
 We believe that we have adequate liquidity to meet our needs for at least the next twelve months. As of September 30, 2024, we had liquidity of 253.8 million, consisting of 112.4 million of availability under our 2018 Revolving Credit Facility, after giving effect to 3.1 million of letters of credit, and cash and cash equivalents of 141.4 million. As any borrowings under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility remain subject to compliance with the financial covenants thereunder (see below and Note 4, Debt and Liquidity ), our operating performance as of September 30, 2024 resulted in a reduction of the availability under the facility. Although we do not anticipate the need to borrow against our 2018 Revolving Credit Facility in 2024, on November 12, 2024, we announced that the Company entered into a commitment letter to take certain actions with respect to its debt (the Commitment Letter ). There can be no assurance that the Transactions contemplated by the Commitment Letter, which remain subject to satisfaction of closing conditions, will be successfully consummated in a timely fashion or at all. See Note 15, Subsequent Event in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. We had long-term debt of 950.0 million and short-term debt of 0.1 million as of each of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, we had liquidity of 289.3 million consisting of 112.4 million available under our 2018 Revolving Credit Facility and cash and cash equivalents of 176.9 million. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 51.5 million and 77.6 million, respectively, of our cash and cash equivalents were located outside of the U.S. We repatriate funds from our foreign subsidiaries through dividends. All of our subsidiaries face the customary statutory limitation that distributed dividends cannot exceed the amount of retained and current earnings. Upon repatriation to the U.S., the foreign source portion of dividends we receive from our foreign subsidiaries are not subject to U.S. federal income tax because the amounts were either previously taxed or are exempted from tax by Section 245A of the Internal Revenue Service Code (the Code ). 
 Our continued access to liquidity and capital resources and the cost of financing depends on multiple factors, including the execution of the transactions contemplated by the Commitment Letter, global economic conditions, the condition of global financial markets, the availability of sufficient amounts of financing, our ability to meet debt covenant requirements, our operating performance, financial outlook, demand for our products and our credit ratings. Global economic disruptions or declines could lead to further market disruption and potential increases to our funding costs. While the terms of our outstanding indebtedness allow us to incur additional debt, as described herein, we are subject to covenants that limit, among other things, our ability, and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries, to incur additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded, or financing sources were to become more limited or to ascribe higher risk to our rating levels or our industry, our access to capital and the cost of any financing would be negatively impacted. There is no guarantee that additional debt financing will be available in the future to fund our expenditures or obligations, or that it will be available on commercially reasonable terms, in which case we may need to seek other sources of funding. In addition, the terms of future debt agreements could include more restrictive covenants than those we are currently subject to, which could restrict our business operations. 
 Cash flow. Our cash flow typically fluctuates significantly between quarters due to various factors. These factors include customer order patterns, fluctuations in working capital requirements, timing of tax and interest payments and other factors.

Debt Structure 
 2018 Term Loan and 2018 Revolving Credit Facility 
 In February 2018, the Company entered into the 2018 Credit Agreement, which provided for (i) the 2,250 million 2018 Term Loan Facility after giving effect to the First Amendment that increased the aggregate principal amount of the 2018 Term Loan Facility from 1,500 million to 2,250 million and (ii) the 330 million 2018 Revolving Credit Facility after giving effect to the May 2022 amendment that increased the revolving commitments under the 2018 Credit Agreement by 80 million from 250 million. GrafTech Finance is the sole borrower under the 2018 Term Loan Facility while GrafTech Finance, Swissco and GrafTech Luxembourg II S. r.l. Luxembourg Holdco and, together with GrafTech Finance and Swissco, the Co-Borrowers are co-borrowers under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility. The 2018 Revolving Credit Facility matures on May 31, 2027. The net proceeds from the 2023 Senior Secured Notes were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our 2018 Term Loan Facility. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the availability under our 2018 Revolving Credit Facility was 112.4 million. As any borrowings under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility remain subject to compliance with the financial covenants thereunder, our operating performance as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 resulted in a reduction of the availability under the facility. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no borrowings outstanding on the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility and there was 3.1 million of letters of credit drawn against the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility as of each date. 
 The 2018 Revolving Credit Facility bears interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either (i) the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate and Adjusted EURIBOR Rate (each, as defined in the 2018 Credit Agreement), plus an applicable margin initially equal to 3.00 per annum or (ii) the ABR Rate, plus an applicable margin initially equal to 2.00 per annum, in each case with two 25 basis point step downs based on achievement of certain senior secured first lien net leverage ratios. In addition, we are required to pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unused commitments under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility in an amount equal to 0.25 per annum. 
 The 2018 Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by each of our domestic subsidiaries, subject to certain customary exceptions, and by GrafTech Luxembourg I S. r.l., a Luxembourg soci t responsabilit limit e and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of GrafTech, Luxembourg HoldCo, and Swissco (collectively, the Guarantors with respect to all obligations under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility of each of our foreign subsidiaries that is a Controlled Foreign Corporation (within the meaning of Section 956 of the Code). 
 Any obligations under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility are secured, subject to certain exceptions, by: (i) a pledge of all of the equity securities of each domestic Guarantor and of each other direct, wholly owned domestic subsidiary of GrafTech and any Guarantor, (ii) a pledge on no more than 65 of the equity interests of each subsidiary that is a Controlled Foreign Corporation (within the meaning of Section 956 of the Code), and (iii) security interests in, and mortgages on, personal property and material real property of each domestic Guarantor, subject to permitted liens and certain exceptions specified in the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility. The obligations of each foreign subsidiary of GrafTech that is a Controlled Foreign Corporation under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility are secured by (i) a pledge of no more than 65 of the equity securities of each Guarantor that is a Controlled Foreign Corporation and of each direct, wholly owned subsidiary of any Guarantor that is a Controlled Foreign Corporation, and (ii) security interests in certain receivables and personal property of each Guarantor that is a Controlled Foreign Corporation, subject to permitted liens and certain exceptions specified in the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility. 
 The 2018 Revolving Credit Facility contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants applicable to GrafTech and restricted subsidiaries, including, among other things, restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments, fundamental changes, dispositions, and dividends and other distributions. The 2018 Revolving Credit Facility contains a financial covenant that requires GrafTech to maintain a senior secured first lien net leverage ratio not greater than 4.00 to 1.00 when the aggregate principal amount of borrowings under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility and outstanding letters of credit issued under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility (except for undrawn letters of credit in an aggregate amount equal to or less than 35.0 million), taken together, exceed 35 of the total amount of commitments under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility. The 2018 Revolving Credit Facility also contains customary events of default. We were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 2020 Senior Secured Notes 
 In December 2020, GrafTech Finance issued 500 million aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Senior Secured Notes at an issue price of 100 of the principal amount thereof in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers in

accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") and to non-U.S. persons outside the United States under Regulation S under the Securities Act. 
 The 2020 Senior Secured Notes are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Company and all of its existing and future direct and indirect U.S. subsidiaries that guarantee, or borrow under, the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility, other than GrafTech Finance. The 2020 Senior Secured Notes are secured on a pari passu basis by the collateral securing the term loans under the 2018 Credit Agreement and the 2023 Senior Secured Notes. GrafTech Finance, the Company and the other guarantors granted a security interest in such collateral, consisting of substantially all of their respective assets, as security for the obligations of GrafTech Finance, the Company and the other guarantors under the 2020 Senior Secured Notes and the Indenture pursuant to a collateral agreement, dated as of December 22, 2020 (the Collateral Agreement ), among GrafTech Finance, the Company, the other subsidiaries of the Company named therein as grantors and U.S. Bank National Association, as collateral agent. 
 The 2020 Senior Secured Notes bear interest at the rate of 4.625 per annum, which accrued from December 22, 2020 and is payable in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing on June 15, 2021. The 2020 Senior Secured Notes will mature on December 15, 2028, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased, and are subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture. 
 GrafTech Finance may redeem some or all of the 2020 Senior Secured Notes at the redemption prices and on the terms specified in the Indenture. If the Company or GrafTech Finance experiences specific kinds of changes in control or the Company or any of its restricted subsidiaries sells certain of its assets, then GrafTech Finance must offer to repurchase the 2020 Senior Secured Notes on the terms set forth in the Indenture. 
 The Indenture contains certain covenants that, among other things, limit the Company s ability, and the ability of certain of its subsidiaries, to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock, pay distributions on, redeem or repurchase capital stock or redeem or repurchase subordinated debt, incur or suffer to exist liens securing indebtedness, make certain investments, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, consummate certain asset sales and effect a consolidation or merger, or sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all assets. The Indenture contains events of default customary for agreements of its type (with customary grace periods, as applicable) and provides that, upon the occurrence of an event of default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Company or GrafTech Finance, all outstanding 2020 Senior Secured Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. If any other type of event of default occurs and is continuing, then the trustee or the holders of at least 30 in principal amount of the then outstanding 2020 Senior Secured Notes may declare all of the 2020 Senior Secured Notes to be due and payable immediately. We were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 2023 Senior Secured Notes 
 In June 2023, GrafTech Global Enterprises Inc. issued 450 million aggregate principal amount of 2023 Senior Secured Notes, including 11.4 million of original issue discount. The 2023 Senior Secured Notes were issued at an issue price of 97.456 of the principal amount thereof in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to non-U.S. persons outside the United States under Regulation S under the Securities Act. 
 The 2023 Senior Secured Notes are or will be, as applicable, guaranteed on a senior secured basis by (i) GrafTech Finance, (ii) the Company and all of its direct and indirect U.S. subsidiaries that, as of the date of the 2023 Senior Secured Notes, guarantee (or are borrowers of) the debt under the 2018 Term Loan Facility and the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility, other than GrafTech Global Enterprises Inc., and (iii) all of the Company s future direct and indirect subsidiaries that guarantee (or are borrowers of) debt under the 2018 Term Loan Facility and the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility, the 2020 Senior Secured Notes and certain other future indebtedness, in each case, other than certain excluded foreign subsidiaries and GrafTech Global Enterprises Inc. The 2023 Senior Secured Notes and the note guarantees are secured on a first-priority basis by liens on the collateral of GrafTech Global Enterprises Inc. and the guarantors securing the debt under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility and the 2020 Senior Secured Notes, on an equal and ratable basis with the debt under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility and 2020 Senior Secured Notes, in each case subject to permitted liens and certain exceptions, pursuant to a collateral agreement, dated as of June 26, 2023 among GrafTech Global Enterprises Inc., the Company, the other subsidiaries of the Company named therein as grantors and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as collateral agent. 
 The 2023 Senior Secured Notes bear interest at a rate of 9.875 per annum which accrued from June 26, 2023 and is payable in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing on December 15, 2023. The 2023 Senior Secured Notes will mature on December 15, 2028, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased, and are subject to the terms of the indenture governing the 2023 Senior Secured Notes (the 2023 Indenture ).

GrafTech Global Enterprises Inc. may redeem some or all of the 2023 Senior Secured Notes at the redemption prices and on the terms specified in the 2023 Indenture. If the Company or GrafTech Global Enterprises experiences specific kinds of changes in control or the Company or any of its restricted subsidiaries sells certain of its assets, then GrafTech Global Enterprises Inc. must offer to repurchase the 2023 Senior Secured Notes on the terms set forth in the 2023 Indenture. 
 The 2023 Indenture contains certain covenants that, among other things, limit the Company s ability, and the ability of certain of its subsidiaries, to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock, pay distributions on, redeem or repurchase capital stock or redeem or repurchase subordinated debt, incur or suffer to exist liens securing indebtedness, make certain investments, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, consummate certain asset sales and effect a consolidation or merger, or sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all assets. The 2023 Indenture contains events of default customary for agreements of its type (with customary grace periods, as applicable) and provides that, upon the occurrence of an event of default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Company or GrafTech Global Enterprises Inc., all outstanding 2023 Senior Secured Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. If any other type of event of default occurs and is continuing, then the trustee or the holders of at least 30 in principal amount of the then outstanding 2023 Senior Secured Notes may declare all of the 2023 Senior Secured Notes to be due and payable immediately. We were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Uses of Liquidity 
 In July 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to 100.0 million of our outstanding common stock. In November 2021, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 150.0 million of stock repurchases under this program. We may purchase shares from time to time on the open market, including under Rule 10b5-1 and/or Rule 10b-18 plans. The amount and timing of repurchases are subject to a variety of factors including liquidity, stock price, applicable legal requirements, other business objectives and market conditions. In the first nine months of 2024, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock. As of September 30, 2024, we had 99.0 million remaining under our stock repurchase authorization. 
 In the first and second quarters of 2023, we paid a quarterly dividend of 0.01 per share. On August 2, 2023, the Company s Board of Directors elected to suspend the quarterly cash dividend of 0.01 per share. There can be no assurance that we will resume paying dividends in the future in these amounts or at all. Our Board of Directors may change the timing and amount of any future dividend payments, if reinstated, or eliminate the payment of future dividends in its sole discretion, without any prior notice to our stockholders. Our ability to pay dividends will depend upon many factors, including our financial position and liquidity, results of operations, legal requirements, restrictions that may be imposed by the terms of our current and future credit facilities and other debt obligations and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. 
 Potential uses of our liquidity (other than operations) include capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends, share repurchases, and other general purposes. Any such potential uses of our liquidity may be funded by existing available liquidity, the incurrence of new secured or unsecured loans, capital market issuances, divestitures, joint ventures or equity investments. An improving economy, while resulting in improved results of operations, could increase our cash requirements to purchase inventories, make capital expenditures and fund payables and other obligations until increased accounts receivable are converted into cash. A downturn, including any recession, could significantly and negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows, which, coupled with increased borrowings, could negatively impact our credit ratings, our ability to comply with debt covenants, our ability to secure additional financing and the cost and availability of such financing. 
 In order to seek to minimize our credit risks, we may reduce our sales of, or refuse to sell (except for prepayment, cash on delivery or under letters of credit or parent guarantees), our products to some customers and potential customers. Our unrecovered trade receivables worldwide have not been material during the last two years individually or in the aggregate. 
 We manage our capital expenditures by taking into account quality, plant reliability, safety, environmental and regulatory requirements, prudent or essential maintenance requirements, global economic conditions, available capital resources, liquidity, long-term business strategy and return on invested capital for the relevant expenditures, cost of capital and return on invested capital of the Company as a whole and other factors. Capital expenditures totaled 21.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We continue to expect full-year capital expenditures to be in the range of 35.0 million to 40.0 million for 2024. 
 In the event that operating cash flows fail to provide sufficient liquidity to meet our business needs, including capital expenditures, any such shortfall would need to be made up by increased borrowings under our 2018 Revolving Credit Facility, to the extent available, or other liquidity options described above. The Company also maintains access to credit and capital

markets and may incur additional debt or issue equity securities from time to time, which may provide an additional source of liquidity. However, there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access the credit or capital markets on commercially satisfactory terms or at all. 
 Cash Flow 
 The following table summarizes our cash flow activities: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in thousands) Net cash (used in) provided by: Operating activities (13,676) 67,269 Investing activities (21,417) (48,067) Financing activities (140) 18,881 Net change in cash and cash equivalents (35,233) 38,083 
 Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities represented a 13.7 million use of cash in the first nine months of 2024 compared to a 67.3 million source of cash in the prior-year period. The decrease in operating cash flow was primarily due to the 43.8 million increased net loss in the first nine months of 2024 versus the first nine months of 2023. In addition, cash provided by working capital decreased 35.1 million. Cash flow provided by accounts receivable decreased 36.8 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to the first nine months of 2023, primarily due to reduced sales. Cash flow provided by inventories decreased 19.2 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to the first nine months of 2023, primarily due to reduced production costs in connection with our efforts to reduce manufacturing costs, as well as reduced quantities on-hand. Cash flow used for accounts payable and accruals increased 5.3 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to the timing of payments in the first nine months of 2024 versus the first nine months of 2023. Cash flow used for income taxes decreased 28.7 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 driven by reduced federal tax payments made in the first nine months of 2024. 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 21.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 48.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to reduced capital expenditures. 
 Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities represented a 0.1 million use of cash for the first nine months of 2024 compared to a 18.9 million source of cash in the first nine months of 2023. Cash flow provided by financing activities in the first nine months of 2023 included 27.5 million cash received from the settlement of interest rate swaps partially offset by 8.1 million of cash used for debt issuance costs. 
 
 Description of Our Financing Structure 
 We discuss our financing structure in more detail in Note 4, Debt and Liquidity in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Non-GAAP financial measures 
 In addition to providing results that are determined in accordance with GAAP, we have provided certain financial measures that are not in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net loss, adjusted loss per share, free cash flow, adjusted free cash flow and cash cost of goods sold per MT are non-GAAP financial measures. 
 We define EBITDA, a non GAAP financial measure, as net loss plus interest expense, minus interest income, plus income taxes and depreciation and amortization. We define adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, as EBITDA adjusted by any pension and other post-employment benefit ("OPEB") plan expenses or benefits, rationalization and rationalization-related expenses, non cash gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement of non operating assets and liabilities in our foreign subsidiaries where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar, stock-based compensation expense, proxy contest expenses, and Tax Receivable Agreement adjustments. Adjusted EBITDA is the primary metric used by our 
 37 

PART I (CONT D) 
 GRAFTECH INTERNATIONAL LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

management and our Board of Directors to establish budgets and operational goals for managing our business and evaluating our performance. 
 We monitor adjusted EBITDA as a supplement to our GAAP measures, and believe it is useful to present to investors, because we believe that it facilitates evaluation of our period to period operating performance by eliminating items that are not operational in nature, allowing comparison of our recurring core business operating results over multiple periods unaffected by differences in capital structure, capital investment cycles and fixed asset base. In addition, we believe adjusted EBITDA and similar measures are widely used by investors, securities analysts, ratings agencies, and other parties in evaluating companies in our industry as a measure of financial performance and debt service capabilities. 
 Our use of adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: 
 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 
 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures for capital equipment or other contractual commitments, including any capital expenditure requirements to augment or replace our capital assets; 
 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness; 
 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; 
 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect expenses or benefits relating to our pension and OPEB plans; 
 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect rationalization or rationalization-related expenses; 
 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the non cash gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement of non operating assets and liabilities in our foreign subsidiaries where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar; 
 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect stock-based compensation expense; 
 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect proxy contest expenses; 
 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect Tax Receivable Agreement adjustments; and 
 other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. 
 We define adjusted net loss, a non GAAP financial measure, as net loss, excluding the items used to calculate adjusted EBITDA, less the tax effect of those adjustments. We define adjusted loss per share, a non GAAP financial measure, as adjusted net loss divided by the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding during the period. We believe adjusted net loss and adjusted loss per share are useful to present to investors because we believe that they assist investors understanding of the underlying operational profitability of the Company. 
 We define free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash provided by or used in operating activities less capital expenditures. We define adjusted free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, as free cash flow adjusted by payments made or received from the settlement of interest rate swap contracts. We use free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow as critical measures in the evaluation of liquidity in conjunction with related GAAP amounts. We also use these measures when considering available cash, including for decision-making purposes related to dividends and discretionary investments. Further, these measures help management, the audit committee, and investors evaluate the Company's ability to generate liquidity from operating activities. 
 We define cash cost of goods sold per MT, a non-GAAP financial measure, as cost of goods sold less depreciation and amortization, less cost of goods sold associated with the portion of our sales that consists of deliveries of by-products of the manufacturing processes and less rationalization-related expenses, with this total divided by our sales volume measured in MT. We believe this is an important measure as it is used by our management and Board of Directors to evaluate our costs on a per MT basis. 
 In evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures, you should be aware that in the future, we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in the reconciliations presented below. Our presentations of these non-GAAP financial measures 
 38 

PART I (CONT D) 
 GRAFTECH INTERNATIONAL LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

should not be construed as suggesting that our future results will be unaffected by these expenses or any unusual or non recurring items. When evaluating our performance, you should consider these non-GAAP financial measures alongside other measures of financial performance and liquidity, including our net loss, loss per share, cash flow from operating activities, cost of goods sold, and other GAAP measures. 
 The following tables reconcile our non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures:

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are exposed to market risks, primarily from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, energy commodity prices and commercial energy rates. From time to time, we enter into transactions that have been authorized according to documented policies and procedures in order to manage these risks. These transactions primarily relate to financial instruments described below. Since the counterparties to these financial instruments are large commercial banks and similar financial institutions, we do not believe that we are exposed to material counterparty credit risk. We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes. 
 If we utilized our 2018 Revolving Credit Facility, we would be exposed to changes in interest rates. Our 2018 Revolving Credit Facility bears interest, at our option, at a rate to either (i) the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate and Adjusted EURIBOR Rate (each, as defined in the 2018 Credit Agreement), plus an applicable margin initially equal to 3.00 per annum or (ii) the ABR Rate, plus an applicable margin initially equal to 2.00 per annum, in each case with two 25 basis point step downs based on achievement of certain senior secured first lien net leverage ratios. 
 42 

PART I (CONT D) 
 GRAFTECH INTERNATIONAL LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates results primarily from: 
 sales made by our subsidiaries in currencies other than local currencies; 
 raw material purchases made by our foreign subsidiaries in currencies other than local currencies; and 
 investments in and intercompany loans to our foreign subsidiaries and our share of the earnings of those subsidiaries, to the extent denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. 
 Our exposure to changes in energy commodity prices and commercial energy rates results primarily from the purchase or sale of refined oil products and the purchase of natural gas and electricity for use in our manufacturing operations. 
 Currency rate management. We enter into foreign currency derivatives from time to time to attempt to manage exposure to changes in currency exchange rates. These foreign currency derivatives, which include, but are not limited to, forward exchange contracts and purchased currency options, attempt to hedge global currency exposures. Forward exchange contracts are agreements to exchange different currencies at a specified future date and at a specified rate. Purchased currency options are instruments which give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to exchange different currencies at a specified rate at a specified date or over a range of specified dates. Forward exchange contracts and purchased currency options are carried at fair value. 
 The outstanding foreign currency derivatives represented unrealized pre-tax net gains of 0.3 million and 0.1 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Sensitivity analysis. We use sensitivity analysis to quantify potential impacts that market rate changes may have on the underlying exposures as well as on the fair values of our derivatives. The sensitivity analysis for the derivatives represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the related gain or loss on the forecasted underlying transaction. 
 As of September 30, 2024, a 10 appreciation or depreciation in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies from the prevailing market rates would have resulted in a corresponding decrease of 1.7 million or a corresponding increase of 1.7 million, respectively, in the fair value of the foreign currency hedge portfolio. 
 For further information related to the financial instruments described above, see Note 9, Fair Value Measurements and Derivative Instruments in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate disclosure controls and procedures. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a reporting company in the reports that it files or submits under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by it in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that these controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting . There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are involved in various investigations, lawsuits, claims, demands, labor disputes and other legal proceedings, including with respect to environmental and human exposure or other personal injury matters, arising out of or incidental to the conduct of our business. While it is not possible to determine the ultimate disposition of each of these matters and proceedings, we do not believe that their ultimate disposition will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, we are involved in the following legal proceedings: 
 Monterrey, Mexico Suspension of Operations 
 Background 
 On September 15, 2022, inspectors from the State Attorney s Office for the Secretary of Environment of the State of Nuevo Le n, Mexico visited GrafTech M xico s graphite electrode manufacturing facility located in Monterrey, Mexico to inspect GrafTech Mexico s facility and certain of the facility s environmental and operating permits. At the conclusion of the inspection, the inspectors issued a Record of Inspection providing for the results of the inspection, their observations, and the imposition of a temporary suspension of GrafTech Mexico s facilities within seven days. In parallel, the Director of Comprehensive Atmospheric Management of the Undersecretary of Climate Change and Air Quality of the Ministry of the Environment of the State of Nuevo Le n formally denied GrafTech Mexico s previously requested modification to its operating license stating that such license was no longer valid. On September 22, 2022, GrafTech Mexico submitted observations and responses to the Record of Inspection, requested an extension of the shutdown of the facility until October 7, 2022, and requested a clarification of the scope of the shutdown. On September 23, 2022, inspectors from the State Attorney s Office for the Secretary of Environment visited GrafTech Mexico s manufacturing facility to verify the information presented in GrafTech Mexico s observations and responses submitted on September 22, 2022. On October 4, 2022, the State Attorney s Office for the Secretary of Environment granted an extension of the shutdown of the facility until October 7, 2022 and clarified the suspension permitting GrafTech Mexico to perform several activities, including extracting or withdrawing finished or unfinished product. On November 17, 2022, the State Attorney s Office for the Secretary of Environment lifted the suspension notice, subject to the completion of certain agreed-upon activities, including the submission of an environmental impact study with respect to the facility s operations, allowing the Monterrey facility to resume operations. Notwithstanding that the suspension notice has been conditionally lifted and that the Monterrey facility has resumed operations, GrafTech Mexico believes it is prudent to continue to pursue the related legal proceeding set forth below. 
 Administrative Proceeding 
 On November 17, 2022, the State Attorney s Office for the Secretary of Environment issued a summons opening an administrative proceeding against GrafTech Mexico, citing the lack of an environmental impact authorization and environmental risk study with respect to the facility s operations. The summons ordered GrafTech Mexico to submit an environmental impact authorization and risk study within 30 business days. GrafTech Mexico submitted its environmental impact authorization and risk study for the full site on November 25, 2022, and filed its response to the summons on December 2, 2022. On August 29, 2024, the State Attorney s Office for the Secretary of Environment initiated the summary argument period providing GrafTech Mexico the opportunity to draft final arguments. GrafTech Mexico was notified of such initiation on September 5, 2024. GrafTech Mexico submitted its final summary arguments on September 10, 2024. On October 3, 2024, the State Attorney s Office for the Secretary of Environment imposed a fine in the amount of approximately 37,152, using an exchange rate of 1 Mexican peso equals 0.051 United States dollars, for failure to have an environmental impact authorization at the time of the inspection that gave rise to the administrative proceeding. On November 5, 2024, GrafTech Mexico paid the fine under protest stating that an environmental impact authorization was not required because GrafTech Mexico began operations in 1960, such requirement to obtain an environmental impact authorization was introduced in the regulations in 1989, and requiring GrafTech Mexico to obtain an environmental impact authorization for all of its facilities, including those that have been operating since 1960, would constitute a retroactive application of such legislation.

 Brazil Clause IV 
 
 Pending litigation in Brazil has been brought by employees seeking to recover additional amounts and interest thereon under certain wage increase provisions applicable in 1989 and 1990 under collective bargaining agreements to which employers in the Bahia region of Brazil were a party (including our subsidiary in Brazil). Companies in Brazil have settled claims arising out of these provisions and, in May 2015, the litigation was remanded by the Brazilian Supreme Court in favor of the employees union. After denying an interim appeal by the Bahia region employers on June 26, 2019, the Brazilian Supreme Court finally ruled in favor of the employees union on September 26, 2019. The employers union has determined not to seek annulment of such decision. Separately, on October 1, 2015, a related action was filed by current and former employees against our subsidiary in Brazil to recover amounts under such provisions, plus interest thereon, which amounts together with interest could be material to us. If the Brazilian Supreme Court proceeding above had been determined in favor of the employers union, it would also have resolved this proceeding in our favor. In the first quarter of 2017, the state court initially ruled in favor of the employees. We appealed this state court ruling, and the appellate court issued a decision in our favor on May 19, 2020. The employees have further appealed and, on December 16, 2020, the court upheld the decision in favor of GrafTech Brazil. On February 22, 2021, the employees filed a further appeal and, on April 28, 2021, the court rejected the employees appeal in favor of GrafTech Brazil. The employees filed a further appeal and on September 12, 2022, we filed our response in opposition. We intend to vigorously defend our position. As of September 30, 2024, we are unable to assess the potential loss associated with these proceedings as the claims do not currently specify the number of employees seeking damages or the amount of damages being sought. 
 Mexico VAT 
 In July 2019, the MTA opened an audit of the VAT filings of GrafTech Commercial Mexico for the period of January 1 to April 30, 2019. In September 2021, the MTA issued a tax assessment, claiming improper use of a certain VAT exemption rule for purchases from a foreign affiliate. As of September 30, 2024, the tax assessment for the four month period under audit amounted to approximately 26.7 million, including penalties, inflation and interest. Interest will continue to accrue up to five years from the date the corresponding VAT returns were filed and inflation will continue to accrue with the passage of time. GrafTech Commercial Mexico filed an administrative appeal against the tax assessment with the MTA s appeals office. In November 2022, the MTA s appeals office concluded its review and confirmed the tax assessment. GrafTech Commercial Mexico believes that the purchases from a foreign affiliate are exempt from VAT back-up withholding and in December 2022, GrafTech Commercial Mexico filed a Claim for Nullity with the Chamber Specialized in exclusive resolution of substance of the Federal Court of Administrative Justice. On February 17, 2023, the MTA filed the response to the nullity petition. On May 31, 2023, the court held a hearing to determine the scope of the issues to be decided in the proceedings. At the court s request, GrafTech Commercial Mexico submitted formal pleadings on August 1, 2023. On January 8, 2024, the court ruled in GrafTech Commercial Mexico s favor and annulled the tax assessment. On January 31, 2024, the MTA filed an appeal for review. On March 15, 2024, GrafTech Commercial Mexico filed the Tax Adhesive Appeal for Review before the Collegiate Court in Administrative Matters who has authority to hear the MTA s appeal. The MTA s appeal and the Adhesive appeal are still pending to be resolved. 
 
 In March 2022, the MTA opened another audit of the VAT filings of GrafTech Commercial Mexico for the period January 1 to December 31, 2018. In the proposed assessment received in January 2023, the MTA is alleging the same improper use of certain VAT exemption rules on purchases from a foreign affiliate and has provided notice of its intent to assess approximately 51.0 million, including penalties, inflation and interest. Interest would continue to accrue up to five years from the date the corresponding VAT returns were filed and inflation would continue to accrue with the passage of time. In Mexico, each tax assessment requires a separate claim. In the first quarter of 2023, GrafTech Commercial Mexico requested a conclusive agreement with the Mexican ombudsman PRODECON to reach a settlement with the MTA. The MTA responded to GrafTech Commercial Mexico s request on May 30, 2023. On August 2, 2023, GrafTech Commercial Mexico filed a motion exhibiting additional information and reaffirming its position. On September 22, 2023, the MTA responded to GrafTech Commercial Mexico s motion. On October 2, 2023, GrafTech Commercial Mexico filed a motion requesting a formal meeting with the MTA and PRODECON, which occurred on November 14, 2023. During the meeting, the parties agreed that GrafTech Commercial Mexico will provide additional documentation and information to be evaluated by the MTA, and, on November 29, 2023, GrafTech Commercial Mexico filed the information requested. On January 24, 2024, the MTA filed its response. On that same day, GrafTech Commercial Mexico submitted before PRODECON the favorable ruling it obtained on January 8, 2024 in connection with the 2019 proceeding for the MTA s consideration. On February 1, 2024, the MTA confirmed its position, holding that GrafTech Commercial Mexico was required to withhold the VAT. On March 20, 2024, a meeting was held at PRODECON where the parties confirmed their final positions. No agreement between the parties was reached, the conclusive agreement procedure came to an end, and the tax audit process resumed. On July 10, 2024, the MTA concluded the tax audit and determined that there is no tax deficiency to be assessed for the period January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018.

 GRAFTECH INTERNATIONAL LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

 As evidenced by the favorable court decision issued on January 8, 2024 with respect to the 2019 proceeding and the MTA s conclusion of the tax audit for the 2018 proceeding, GrafTech Commercial Mexico s application of the VAT exemption rules is appropriate and, accordingly, GrafTech Commercial Mexico does not believe that it is probable that it will incur a loss related to this matter for the 2019 proceeding under the MTA s audit. The Company intends to vigorously defend its position in the 2019 proceeding. 
 Stockholder Class Action 
 On January 25, 2024, a stockholder of the Company filed a class action complaint on behalf of a putative class consisting of purchasers of GrafTech common stock between February 8, 2019 and August 3, 2023 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The complaint names the Company, certain past and present executive officers, and three entities associated with Brookfield as defendants. The complaint alleges that certain public filings and statements made by the Company contained material misrepresentations or omissions relating to the circumstances before and after the prior temporary suspension of the Company s graphite electrode facility located in Monterrey, Mexico, in September 2022. The complaint seeks unspecified compensatory damages, costs and expenses, and unspecified equitable or injunctive relief. On May 15, 2024, the Court appointed the University of Puerto Rico Retirement System as the lead plaintiff. On October 7, 2024, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint. At this stage of the proceedings, it is too early to determine if the matter would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 There have been no material changes to the Risk Factors disclosed in Part 1, Item 1A., Risk Factors, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February 14, 2024. You should not interpret the disclosure of any risk factor to imply that the risk has not already materialized. 

Item 5. Other Information 
 None of the Company s directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act) , modified, or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as each term is defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K) during the Company s fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024.
