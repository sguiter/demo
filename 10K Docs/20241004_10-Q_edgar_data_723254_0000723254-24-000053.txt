Note 2 - 
 First Aid and Safety Services Fire Protection Services Uniform Direct Sales Total revenue 
 The Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sales operating segments are included within All Other as disclosed in Note 10 entitled Segment Information. 
 
 Revenue Recognition Policy 
 Approximately of the Company's revenue is derived from fees for route servicing of Uniform Rental and Facility Services, First Aid and Safety Services and Fire Protection Services customers, performed by a Cintas employee-partner, at the customer's location of business. Revenue from our route servicing customer contracts represent a single-performance obligation. The Company recognizes revenue over time as services are performed, based on the nature of services provided and contractual rates (output method) or at a point in time when the performance obligation under the terms of the contract with a customer are satisfied, at the customer's location of business. The Company's performance period generally corresponds with the monthly invoice period. The Company's remaining revenue, primarily within the Uniform Direct Sales operating segment, and representing approximately of the Company's total revenue, is recognized when the obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied. This generally occurs when the goods are transferred to the customer. 
 
 We are exposed to credit losses primarily through our trade receivables. We determine the allowance for credit losses using both an estimate, based on historical rates of collections, and reserves for specific accounts identified as uncollectible. The portion of the allowance for credit losses that is an estimate based on Cintas' historical rates of collections is recorded for overdue amounts, beginning with a nominal percentage when the account is current and increasing substantially as the account ages. The amount provided as the account ages will differ slightly between the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment, the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and All Other because of differences in customers served and the nature of each business. We update our allowance for credit losses quarterly, considering recent write-offs and collections information and underlying economic expectations. 
 
 Costs to Obtain a Contract 
 The Company capitalizes commission expenses paid to our employee-partners when the commissions are deemed to be incremental for obtaining the route servicing customer contract. Capitalized commissions are classified as current or noncurrent based on the timing of when we expect to recognize the expense. The current portion is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and the noncurrent portion is included in other assets, net on the Company's consolidated condensed balance sheets. As of August 31, 2024, the current and noncurrent assets related to capitalized commissions totaled million and million, respectively. As of May 31, 2024, the current and noncurrent assets related to capitalized commissions totaled million and million, respectively. The Company recorded amortization expense related to capitalized commissions of million and million during the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These expenses are classified in selling and administrative expenses on the consolidated condensed statements of income.

Note 4 - 
 
 Other assets, net: Interest rate lock agreements Total assets at fair value 
 Cintas cash and cash equivalents are generally classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Financial instruments classified as Level 1 are based on quoted market prices in active markets. The types of financial instruments Cintas classifies within Level 1 include most bank deposits and money market securities. Cintas does not adjust the quoted market price for such financial instruments. 
 
 The fair values of Cintas' interest rate lock agreements are based on similar exchange traded derivatives (market approach) and are, therefore, included within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value was determined by comparing the locked rates against the benchmarked treasury rate. No other amounts included in other assets, net, are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. 
 
 The methods described above may produce a fair value that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while Cintas believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the consolidated condensed balance sheet dates. 
 
 In addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, Cintas records assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as required under U.S. GAAP. The assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis primarily relate to assets and liabilities acquired in a business acquisition.

Cintas' senior notes, excluding the G K senior notes assumed with the acquisition of G K in fiscal 2017, are recorded at cost, net of debt issuance costs. The fair value of the long-term debt is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on observable market prices. The carrying value and fair value of Cintas' debt as of August 31, 2024 were million and million, respectively, and as of May 31, 2024 were million and million, respectively. During the three months ended August 31, 2024, Cintas issued million, net of commercial paper. During the three months ended August 31, 2023, Cintas repurchased, and subsequently retired, million of its , senior notes. In conjunction with these transactions Cintas recognized a loss of million, which is recorded in interest expense on the consolidated condensed statements of income for the thre e months ended Au gust 31, 2023. 
 
 The credit agreement that supports our commercial paper program has capacity under the revolving credit facility of billion. The credit agreement has an accordion feature that provides Cintas the ability to request increases to the borrowing commitments under the revolving credit facility of up to million in the aggregate, subject to customary conditions. The maturity date of the revolving credit facility is March 23, 2027. As of August 31, 2024, there was million of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of and borrowings on our revolving credit facility. As of May 31, 2024, there was commercial paper outstanding and borrowings on our revolving credit facility. The fair value of the commercial paper, which approximates carrying value, is estimated using level 2 inputs based on observable market prices and interest rates. 
 
 Cintas uses interest rate locks to manage its overall interest expense as interest rate locks effectively change the interest rate of specific debt issuances. The interest rate locks are entered into to protect against unfavorable movements in the benchmark treasury rate related to forecasted debt issuances. Cintas used interest rate locks, which represent cash flow hedges, to hedge against movements in the treasury rates at the time Cintas issued its senior notes in fiscal 2007, fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2022. For the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, the amortization of the interest rate locks resulted in a decrease to other comprehensive income (loss) of million and million, respectively. 
 
 During fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2020, Cintas entered into interest rate lock agreements for forecasted debt issuances. The aggregate notional value of outstanding cash flow hedges was million at both August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024.

 The changes in fair value of the interest rate locks are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. These interest rate locks had no impact on net income or cash flows for the three months ended August 31, 2024 or 2023. 
 
 Cintas has certain covenants related to debt agreements. These covenants limit Cintas' ability to incur certain liens, to engage in sale-leaseback transactions and to merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of Cintas' assets. These covenants also require Cintas to maintain certain debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and interest coverage ratios. Cross-default provisions exist between certain debt instruments. If a default of a significant covenant were to occur, the default could result in an acceleration of the maturity of the indebtedness, impair liquidity and limit the ability to raise future capital. Cintas was in compliance with all of the debt covenants for all periods presented. 

Note 8 - 
 million and million, respectively, and are included in long-term accrued liabilities on the consolidated condensed balance sheets. 
 
 The majority of Cintas' operations are in North America. Cintas is required to file U.S. federal income tax returns, as well as state income tax returns in a majority of the domestic states and also in certain Canadian provinces. At times, Cintas is subject to audits in these jurisdictions. The audits, by nature, are sometimes complex and can require several years to resolve. The final resolution of any such tax audit could result in either a reduction in Cintas' accruals or an increase in its income tax provision, either of which could have an impact on the consolidated results of operations in any given period. 
 
 All U.S. federal income tax returns are closed to audit through fiscal 2020. Cintas is currently in various audits in certain foreign jurisdictions and certain domestic states. The years under foreign and domestic state audits cover fiscal years back to 2018. Based on the status and resolution of the various audits and other potential regulatory developments, it is expected that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits will not materially change for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2025. 
 
 Cintas effective tax rate was and for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate for both periods was impacted by certain discrete items (primarily the tax accounting for stock-based compensation).

 million, which was accrued for and included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated condensed balance sheet at August 31, 2024. The amount reserved for this matter did not have a material impact on the consolidated condensed statements of income for any period presented. The Company will also make certain future investments such as people and technology. These future investments are not expected to be material to the Company. The tentative settlement remains subject to confirmatory discovery and approval of the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada, however, we do not anticipate any material changes in the amounts reflected in the consolidated condensed financial statements. 
 
 The Company, the Board of Directors, Scott Farmer (Executive Chairman) and the Investment Policy Committee are defendants in a purported class action, filed on December 13, 2019, pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio alleging violations of The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). The lawsuit asserts that the defendants improperly managed the costs of the employee retirement plan, breached their fiduciary duties in failing to investigate and select lower cost alternative funds and failed to monitor and control the employee retirement plan s recordkeeping costs. In November 2023, an agreement in principle was reached with the plaintiffs, which would require a payment of an immaterial amount that would be covered by the Company's insurance. The settlement received final approval by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio in August 2024.

ITEM 2. 
 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Business Strategy 
 Cintas helps more than one million businesses of all types and sizes, primarily in the United States (U.S.), as well as Canada and Latin America, get READY to open their doors with confidence every day by providing a wide range of products and services that enhance our customers image and help keep their facilities and employees clean, safe and looking their best. With products and services including uniforms, mats, mops, restroom supplies, first aid and safety products, fire extinguishers and testing, and safety training, Cintas helps customers get Ready for the Workday . 
 
 We are North America s leading provider of corporate identity uniforms through rental and sales programs, as well as a significant provider of related business services, including entrance mats, restroom cleaning services and supplies, first aid and safety services, and fire protection products and services. 
 
 Cintas principal objective is to exceed customers expectations in order to maximize the long-term value of Cintas for shareholders and working partners, and it provides the framework and focus for Cintas business strategy. This strategy is to achieve revenue growth for all our products and services by increasing our penetration at existing customers and by broadening our customer base to include market segments to which we have not historically served. We will also continue to identify additional product and service opportunities for our current and future customers. 
 
 To pursue the strategy of increasing penetration, we have a highly talented and diverse team of service professionals visiting our customers on a regular basis. This frequent contact with our customers enables us to develop close personal relationships. The combination of our distribution system and these strong customer relationships provides a platform from which we launch additional products and services. 
 
 We pursue the strategy of broadening our customer base in several ways. Cintas has a national sales organization introducing all its products and services to prospects in all market segments. Our broad range of products and services allows our sales organization to consider any type of business a prospect. We also broaden our customer base through geographic expansion. Finally, we evaluate strategic acquisitions as opportunities arise. 

Results of Operations 
 Cintas classifies its business into two reportable operating segments and places the remainder of its operating segments in an All Other category. Cintas two reportable operating segments are Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments including flame resistant clothing, mats, mops and shop towels and other ancillary items. In addition to these rental items, restroom cleaning services and supplies and the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route are included within this reportable operating segment. The First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment consists of first aid and safety products and services. The remainder of Cintas business, which consists of the Fire Protection Services operating segment and the Uniform Direct Sale operating segment, is included in All Other. These operating segments consist of fire protection products and services and the direct sale of uniforms and related items. Cintas evaluates operating segment performance based on revenue and operating income. Revenue and operating income for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, for the two reportable operating segments and All Other are presented in Note 10 entitled Segment Information of Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements. 
 
 All references made to common stock shares, equity awards, common stock per share amounts or treasury share amounts throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of a four-for-one split of the Company's common stock on September 11, 2024 (the Stock Split). See Note 1 entitled Basis of Presentation of "Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements" for additional information on the Stock Split.

 Total revenue increased 6.8 to 2,501.6 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024, compared to 2,342.3 million for the three months ended August 31, 2023. The organic revenue growth rate, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, workday differences and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 8.0 . Revenue growth was positively impacted by 0.6 due to acquisitions, negatively impacted by 1.6 due to one less workday in the three months ended August 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023 and negatively impacted by 0.2 due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. 
 
 Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment revenue was 1,933.8 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024, compared to 1,826.8 million for the three months ended August 31, 2023, which was an increase of 5.9 . The organic revenue growth rate for this reportable operating segment was 7.0 .

Revenue growth was a result of new business, the penetration of additional products and services into existing customers and price increases, partially offset by lost business. New business growth resulted from an increase in the number and productivity of sales representatives. 
 
 Other revenue, consisting of revenue from the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and All Other, increased 10.1 for the three months ended August 31, 2024, compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023, from 515.5 million to 567.7 million.

 Cost of uniform rental and facility services consists primarily of production expenses, delivery expenses and the amortization of in service inventory, including uniforms, mats, shop towels and other ancillary items. Cost of uniform rental and facility services increased 33.6 million, or 3.5 , for the three months ended August 31, 2024, compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023. Cost of uniform rental and facility services improved as a percent of revenue, decreasing from 51.9 for the three months ended August 31, 2023, to 50.7 for the three months ended August 31, 2024. This improvement as a percent of revenue was primarily due to efficiency gains in energy and in-service inventory usage and improved leverage of fixed costs. 
 
 Cost of other consists primarily of cost of goods sold (predominantly first aid and safety products, personal protective equipment, uniforms and fire protection products), delivery expenses and distribution expenses in the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and All Other. Cost of other increased 15.1 million, or 6.0 , for the three months ended August 31, 2024, compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023 as a result of higher other revenue. Cost of other improved as a percent of revenue, decreasing from 49.1 for three months ended August 31, 2023, to 47.3 for the three months ended August 31, 2024. The improvement in cost of sales as a percent of revenue was primarily due to favorable changes in the sales mix and sourcing and productivity initiatives in the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment, as well as i mproved leverage of fixed costs for both the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and All Other. 
 
 Selling and administrative expenses increased 50.1 million, or 7.8 , in the three months ended August 31, 2024, compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue were 27.6 for the three months ended August 31, 2024, compared to 27.4 for the three months ended August 31, 2023. The change as a percent of revenue is primarily due to an increase in employee-partner related expenses. 
 
 Operating income was 561.0 million, or 22.4 of revenue, for the three months ended August 31, 2024, compared to 500.6 million, or 21.4 of revenue, for the three months ended August 31, 2023. The improvement in operating income as a percent of revenue was primarily due to operating leverage from revenue growth, efficiency gains in energy and in-service inventory usage, partially offset by the increase in selling and administrative expense noted above.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The following is a summary of our cash flows and cash and cash equivalents as of and for the three months ended August 31: 
 (In thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 466,732 336,945 Net cash used in investing activities (114,332) (169,836) Net cash used in financing activities (592,792) (202,375) Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period 101,373 88,126 
 Cash and cash equivalents as of August 31, 2024 and 2023, include 51.0 million and 30.2 million, respectively, that is located outside of the U.S. 
 
 Cash flows provided by operating activities have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. We generally use these cash flows to fund most, if not all, of our operations and expansion activities and dividends on our common stock. We may also use cash flows provided by operating activities, as well as proceeds from long-term debt and short-term borrowings to fund growth and expansion opportunities, as well as other cash requirements such as the repurchase of our common stock and payment of long-term debt. 
 
 We expect our cash flows from operating activities to remain sufficient to provide us with adequate levels of liquidity. In addition, we have access to 2.0 billion of debt capacity from our amended and restated revolving credit facility. We believe the Company has sufficient liquidity to operate in the current business environment for at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future thereafter. Acquisitions, repurchases of our common stock and dividends remain strategic objectives, but they will be dependent on the economic outlook and liquidity of the Company. 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 466.7 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024, compared to 336.9 million for the three months ended August 31, 2023. The change from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in net income and favorable changes in working capital, specifically accounts payable and accrued compensation and related liabilities. These improvements were partially offset by unfavorable changes in working capital, specifically, income taxes and uniforms and other rental items in service. 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities includes capital expenditures, purchases of investments and cash paid for acquisitions of businesses. Capital expenditures were 92.9 million and 106.7 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Capital expenditures in the three months ended August 31, 2024, included 67.7 million for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment and 10.6 million for the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment. Cash paid for acquisitions of businesses was 9.4 million and 55.7 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The acquisitions during both the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, occurred in our Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment, our First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and our Fire Protection operating segment, which is included in All Other. Net cash used in investing activities also includes 7.1 million and 6.5 million of purchases of investments during the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Net cash used in financing activities was 592.8 million and 202.4 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in cash used in financing activities was due to the increase in share buyback activity and an increase in dividends paid. This increase was partially offset by the net issuance of commercial paper and a decrease in payments of debt in the three months ended August 31, 2024. 
 
 Cintas announced on July 27, 2021, July 26, 2022, and July 23, 2024, that the Board of Directors (the Board) authorized share buyback programs for 1.5 billion, 1.0 billion and 1.0 billion, respectively.

 (1) Variable rate debt instrument. The rate presented is the variable borrowing rate at August 31, 2024. 
 (2) Cintas assumed these senior notes with the acquisition of G K Services, Inc. (G K) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, and they were recorded at fair value. The interest rate shown above is the effective interest rate until repayment in fiscal 2025. 
 The credit agreement that supports our commercial paper program has a revolving credit facility with a capacity of 2.0 billion. The credit agreement has an accordion feature that provides Cintas the ability to request increases to the borrowing commitments under the revolving credit facility of up to 500.0 million in the aggregate, subject to customary conditions. The maturity date of the revolving credit facility is March 23, 2027. As of August 31, 2024, there was 166.0 million of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 5.44 and no borrowings on our revolving credit facility. As of May 31, 2024, there was no commercial paper outstanding and no borrowings on our revolving credit facility. 
 
 Cintas has certain covenants related to debt agreements. These covenants limit our ability to incur certain liens, to engage in sale-leaseback transactions and to merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of Cintas' assets. These covenants also require Cintas to maintain certain debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and interest coverage ratios. Cross-default provisions exist between certain debt instruments. If a default of a significant covenant were to occur, the default could result in an acceleration of the maturity of the indebtedness, impair liquidity and limit the ability to raise future capital. Cintas was in compliance with all of the debt covenants for all periods presented. 
 
 Our access to the commercial paper and long-term debt markets has historically provided us with sources of liquidity. We do not anticipate having difficulty in obtaining financing from those markets in the future based on our favorable experiences in the debt markets in the recent past. Additionally, our ability to continue to access the commercial paper and long-term debt markets on favorable interest rate and other terms will depend, to a significant degree, on the ratings assigned by the credit rating agencies to our indebtedness. As of August 31, 2024, our ratings were as follows: 
 Rating Agency Outlook Commercial Paper Long-term Debt Standard Poor s Stable A-2 A- Moody s Investors Service Stable P-2 A3

Table of Contents 

In the event that the ratings of our commercial paper or our outstanding long-term debt issues were substantially lowered or withdrawn for any reason, or if the ratings assigned to any new issue of long-term debt securities were significantly lower than those noted above, particularly if we no longer had investment grade ratings, our ability to access the debt markets may be adversely affected. In addition, in such a case, our cost of funds for new issues of commercial paper and long-term debt would be higher than our cost of funds would have been had the ratings of those new issues been at or above the level of the ratings noted above. The rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies. 
 
 To monitor our credit rating and our capacity for long-term financing, we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors. One such factor is the ratio of our total debt to EBITDA. For the purpose of this calculation, debt is defined as the sum of short-term borrowings, long-term debt due within one year, long-term debt and standby letters of credit.
