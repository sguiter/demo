The Company s investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. The Company offers customized financing to business owners, management teams, and financial sponsors for change of ownership transactions, recapitalizations, strategic acquisitions, business expansion, and other growth initiatives. The Company invests in first lien loans, and, to a lesser extent, second lien loans and equity securities issued by lower middle-market and traditional middle-market companies.

Fund II and Fund III retained their small business investment company SBIC licenses, continued to hold their existing investments at the time of the IPO and have continued to make new investments. The IPO consisted of the sale of shares of the Company s common stock at a price of per share, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of million, after deducting underwriting fees and commissions totaling million and offering expenses totaling million.

The Company has formed, and expects to continue to form, certain consolidated taxable subsidiaries (the Taxable Subsidiaries ), which are taxed as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Taxable Subsidiaries allow the Company to make equity investments in companies organized as pass-through entities while continuing to satisfy the requirements of a RIC under the Code. Capitala Business Lending, LLC CBL ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, was established on October 30, 2020, for the sole purpose of holding certain investments pledged as collateral under the Company's line of credit with KeyBank National Association (the KeyBank Credit Facility ).

As of December 31, 2023 , we had debt investments in portfolio companies on non-accrual status with aggregate amortized cost of million and an aggregate fair value of million, which represented and of the investment portfolio, respectively. Gains and losses on investment sales: Realized gains and losses on investments are recognized using the specific identification method. Dividend income and payment-in-kind dividends: Dividend income is recognized on the date dividends are declared. The Company holds preferred equity investments in the portfolio that contain a PIK dividend provision. PIK dividends, which represent contractually deferred dividends added to the equity balance, are recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. The Company will typically cease accrual of PIK dividends when the fair value of the equity investment is less than the cost basis of the investment or when it is otherwise determined by management that PIK dividends are unlikely to be collected. If management determines that a decline in fair value is temporary in nature and PIK dividends are more likely than not to be collected, management may elect to continue accruing PIK dividends. Original issue discount: Discounts received to par on loans purchased are capitalized and accreted into income over the life of the loan. Any remaining discount is accreted into income upon prepayment of the loan. Other income: Origination fees (to the extent services are performed to earn such income upon closing), amendment fees, consent fees, and other fees associated with investments in portfolio companies are recognized as income when they are earned. Prepayment penalties received by the Company for debt instruments repaid prior to maturity date are recorded as income upon receipt.

Furthermore, in management s opinion, it is not possible to estimate a range of reasonably possible losses with respect to litigation contingencies. 
 of its investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, for each fiscal tax year. The Company will be subject to a nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax of on certain undistributed income if it does not distribute an amount at least equal to the sum of (i) of its ordinary income for the calendar year, (ii) of its capital gains in excess of capital losses for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year, and (iii) any ordinary income and capital gain net income that it recognized for preceding years, but was not distributed during such years, and on which it paid no U.S. federal income tax. Depending on the level of taxable income earned in an excise tax year, the Company may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions into the next excise tax year and pay a excise tax on such income, as required. To the extent that the Company determines that its estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions for U.S. federal excise tax purposes, the Company accrues excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned. Since the Company s IPO, the Company has not accrued or paid excise tax. The tax years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, 2021 and 2020 remain subject to examination by U.S. federal, state, and local tax authorities. material interest expense or penalties have been assessed fo r the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , tax provision was recorded by the Company. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the valuation allowance on the Company s net deferred tax asset was million and million, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company recognized change in the valuation allowance and a decrease of million, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , the Company recognized an increase in the valuation allowance of million and million, respectively. In accordance with certain applicable U.S. Treasury regulations and guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service, a publicly offered RIC may treat a distribution of its own stock as fulfilling its RIC distribution requirements if each stockholder may elect to receive its entire distribution in either cash or stock of the RIC, subject to a limitation on the aggregate amount of cash available to be distributed to all stockholders, which limitation must be at least of the aggregate declared distribution. If too many stockholders elect to receive cash, the cash available for distribution must be allocated pro rata among the stockholders electing to receive cash (with the balance of the distribution paid in stock). In no event will any stockholder, electing to receive cash, receive less than of its entire distribution in cash. If these and certain other requirements are met, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the amount of the dividend paid in stock will be equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead of stock. ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes ASC 740 ), provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented, and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements. ASC 740 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Company s U.S. federal income tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions deemed to meet a more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current period. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , there were uncertain tax positions. The Company is required to determine whether a tax position of the Company is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. De-recognition of a tax benefit previously recognized could result in the Company recording a tax liability that could negatively impact the Company s net assets. The Company has concluded that it was not necessary to record a liability for any such tax positions as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. However, the Company s conclusions regarding this policy may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, ongoing analyses of, and changes to, tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof.

As of September 30, 2024 , our portfolio consisted of investments in portfolio companies with a fair value of approximately million . As of December 31, 2023 , our portfolio consisted of investments in portfolio companies with a fair value of approximately million . Most of the Company s debt investments are structured as first lien loans. First lien loans may contain some minimum amount of principal amortization, excess cash flow sweep feature, prepayment penalties, or any combination of the foregoing. First lien loans are secured by a first priority lien in existing and future assets of the borrower and may take the form of term loans, delayed draw facilities, or revolving credit facilities. Unitranche debt, a form of first lien loan, typically involves issuing one debt security that blends the risk and return profiles of both senior secured and subordinated debt, bifurcating the loan into a first-out tranche and last-out tranche. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, none of the fair value of our first lien loans consisted of last-out loans. The Company also invests in debt instruments structured as second lien loans. Second lien loans are loans which have a second priority security interest in all or substantially all of the borrower s assets, and in some cases, may be subject to the interruption of cash interest payments upon certain events of default, at the discretion of the first lien lender. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we made approximately million of investments and had approximately million in repayments and sales, resulting in net repayments and sales of approximately million for the period.

As noted above, the Company values all investments in accordance with Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act and ASC 820. ASC 820 requires enhanced disclosures about assets and liabilities that are measured and reported at fair value. As defined in ASC 820, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 establishes a hierarchal disclosure framework which prioritizes and ranks the level of market price observability of inputs used in measuring investments at fair value. Market price observability is affected by a number of factors, including the type of investment and the characteristics specific to the investment. Investments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment used in measuring fair value. Based on the observability of the inputs used in the valuation techniques, the Company is required to provide disclosures on fair value measurements according to the fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy ranks the observability of the inputs used to determine fair values. Investments carried at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: 

Level 1 Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access.

The significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of the Company s investments are required rate of return, EBITDA multiples, revenue multiples, discount margin, litigation proceeds coverage, stock price, projected time to exit and volatility. Changes in any of these unobservable inputs could have a significant impact on the Company s estimate of fair value. An increase (decrease) in the required rate of return or discount margin will result in a lower (higher) estimate of fair value, respectively, while an increase (decrease) in adjusted EBITDA or revenue multiples, litigation proceeds coverage, stock price, projected time to exit (option-pricing model) or volatility will result in a higher (lower) estimate of fair value, respectively.

 of the gross assets, which are the total assets reflected on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities and includes any borrowings for investment purposes. Although the Company does not anticipate making significant investments in derivative financial instruments, the fair value of any such investments, which will not necessarily equal their notional value, will be included in the calculation of gross assets. For services rendered under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears. The base management fee is calculated based on the average value of the gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, and appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current calendar quarter. The incentive fee consists of the following two parts: The first part of the incentive fee is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on the pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. For this purpose, pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income, and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, diligence, and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement to our Administrator, and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, computed net of all realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to a hurdle of per quarter annualized). The Company pays the Investment Adviser an incentive fee with respect to the pre-incentive fee net investment income in each calendar quarter as follows: no incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which the pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the hurdle of ; of the pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle but is less than in any calendar quarter annualized). The Company refers to this portion of the pre-incentive fee net investment income (which exceeds the hurdle but is less than as the catch-up. The catch-up is meant to provide the Investment Adviser with of the pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle did not apply if this net investment income exceeds in any calendar quarter; and of the amount of the pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds in any calendar quarter annualized) is payable to the Investment Adviser (once the hurdle is reached and the catch-up is achieved, of all pre-incentive fee investment income thereafter is allocated to the Investment Adviser). The second part of the incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year, commencing on December 31, 2021, and equals of the Company s realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis with respect to each of the investments in the Company s portfolio from the fiscal quarter ending on or immediately prior to July 1, 2021 through the end of each calendar year beginning with the calendar year ending December 31, 2021, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis from September 30, 2021 through the end of each calendar year beginning with the calendar year ending December 31, 2021, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain fees under the Investment Advisory Agreement. Any realized capital gains, realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation with respect to the Company s portfolio as of the end of the fiscal quarter ending on or immediately prior to July 1, 2021 are excluded from the calculations of the capital gains fee. In the event that the Investment Advisory Agreement terminates as of a date that is not a calendar year end, the termination date shall be treated as though it were a calendar year end for purposes of calculating and paying a capital gains fee. The Company will defer cash payment of the portion of any incentive fee otherwise earned by the Investment Adviser that would, when taken together with all other incentive fees paid to the Investment Adviser during the most recent 12 full calendar month period ending on or prior to the date such payment is to be made, exceed of the sum of (a) the pre-incentive fee net investment income during such period, (b) the net unrealized appreciation or depreciation during such period and (c) the net realized capital gains or losses during such period. Any deferred incentive fees will be carried over for payment in subsequent calculation periods to the extent

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Except as otherwise indicated, the terms we , us , our , the Company , Logan Ridge and LRFC refer to Logan Ridge Finance Corporation. 
 Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the Company, our current and prospective portfolio investments, our industry, our beliefs, and our assumptions. Words such as anticipates, expects, intends, plans, will, may, continue, believes, seeks, estimates, would, could, should, targets, projects, and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. 
 Some of the statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q constitute forward-looking statements, which relate to future events or our performance or financial condition. The forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q involve risks and uncertainties, including statements as to: 
 our future operating results; 

our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies, including our and their ability to achieve our respective objectives; 

the impact of investments that we expect to make; 

our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; 

the dependence of our future success on the general economy and its impact on the industries in which we invest; 

our expected financings and investments; 

the adequacy of our cash resources and working capital; and 

the timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations of our portfolio companies. 

These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements, including without limitation: 
 an economic downturn could impair our portfolio companies ability to continue to operate or repay their borrowings, which could lead to the loss of some or all of our investments in such portfolio companies; 

a contraction of available credit and/or an inability to access the equity markets could impair our lending and investment activities; 

geopolitical instability and volatility in the global markets caused by events such as the deterioration in the bilateral relationship between the U.S. and China, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine , and the conflict between Israel and Hamas ; 

uncertain effects due to the discontinuation of LIBOR and due to the transition to SOFR; 

interest rate volatility could adversely affect our results, particularly if we use leverage as part of our investment strategy; and 

the risks, uncertainties and other factors we identify in Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Although we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. Important assumptions include our ability to originate new loans and investments, certain margins and levels of profitability, and the availability of additional capital. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. These risks and uncertainties include those described or identified in Risk Factors and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, unless required by law or U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC rule or regulation.

The Company was formed for the purpose of (i) acquiring, through a series of transactions, an investment portfolio from the following entities: CapitalSouth Partners Fund I Limited Partnership Fund I CapitalSouth Partners Fund II Limited Partnership Fund II CapitalSouth Partners Fund III, L.P. Fund III Parent CapitalSouth Fund III, L.P. (f/k/a CapitalSouth Partners SBIC Fund III, L.P.) Fund III and CapitalSouth Partners Florida Sidecar Fund I, L.P. Florida Sidecar and, collectively with Fund I, Fund II, Fund III and Fund III Parent, the Legacy Funds (ii) raising capital in the IPO and (iii) continuing and expanding the business of the Legacy Funds by making additional debt and equity investments in lower middle-market and traditional middle-market companies. 
 On September 24, 2013, the Company acquired 100 of the limited partnership interests in Fund II, Fund III, and Florida Sidecar and each of their respective general partners, as well as certain assets from Fund I and Fund III Parent, in exchange for an aggregate of 8,974,420 shares of the Company s common stock (the Formation Transactions ). Fund II, Fund III, and Florida Sidecar became the Company s wholly owned subsidiaries. Fund II and Fund III retained their small business investment company SBIC licenses issued by the U.S. Small Business Administration SBA ), and continued to hold their existing investments at the time of IPO and have continued to make new investments after the IPO. The IPO consisted of the sale of 4,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock at a price of 20.00 per share resulting in net proceeds to the Company of 74.25 million, after deducting underwriting fees and commissions totaling 4.0 million and offering expenses totaling 1.75 million. The other costs of the IPO were borne by the limited partners of the Legacy Funds. During the fourth quarter of 2017, Florida Sidecar transferred all of its assets to the Company and was legally dissolved as a standalone partnership. On March 1, 2019, Fund II repaid its outstanding debentures guaranteed by the SBA SBA-guaranteed debentures and relinquished its SBIC license. On June 10, 2021, Fund III repaid its SBA-guaranteed debentures and relinquished its SBIC license. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding. 
 At the time of the Formation Transactions, our portfolio consisted of: (1) approximately 326.3 million in investments; (2) an aggregate of approximately 67.1 million in cash, interest receivable and other assets; and (3) liabilities of approximately 202.2 million of SBA-guaranteed debentures payable. Fund III, our subsidiary, was licensed under the SBIC Act until June 10, 2021 and has elected to be regulated as BDC under the 1940 Act. Fund II, our subsidiary, was licensed under the SBIC Act until March 1, 2019 and has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. 
 The Company has formed and expects to continue to form certain consolidated taxable subsidiaries (the Taxable Subsidiaries ), which are taxed as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Taxable Subsidiaries allow the Company to make equity investments in companies organized as pass-through entities while continuing to satisfy the requirements of a RIC under the Code. 
 Capitala Business Lending, LLC CBL ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours, was established on October 30, 2020, for the sole purpose of holding certain investments pledged as collateral under a senior secured revolving credit agreement with KeyBank National Association (the KeyBank Credit Facility ). See Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources for more details. The financial statements of CBL are consolidated with those of Logan Ridge Finance Corporation. 
 In addition, we evaluate strategic opportunities available to us, including mergers with unaffiliated funds and affiliated funds, divestures, spin-offs, joint ventures and other similar transactions from time to time. An example of an opportunity we are currently in the initial stages of evaluating is a potential merger with one or more of our affiliated 1940 Act funds, which may result in the use of an exchange ratio other than NAV-for-NAV (including but not limited to relative market price) in connection therewith. 
 Definitive Agreement 
 On April 20, 2021, Capitala Investment Advisors, LLC Capitala ), the Company s former investment adviser, entered into a definitive agreement (the Definitive Agreement with the Investment Adviser and Mount Logan Capital Inc. MLC ), both affiliates of BC Partners Advisors L.P. BC Partners for U.S. regulatory purposes, whereby Mount Logan acquired certain assets related to Capitala s business of providing investment management services to the Company (the Transaction ), through which the Investment Adviser became the Company s investment adviser pursuant to an investment advisory agreement (the Investment Advisory Agreement with the Company. At a special meeting of the Company s stockholders (the Special Meeting held on May 27, 2021, the Company s stockholders approved the Investment Advisory Agreement. The transactions contemplated by the Definitive Agreement closed on July 1, 2021 (the Closing ). 
 As part of the Transaction, the Investment Adviser entered into a two-year contractual fee waiver (the Fee Waiver with the Company to waive, to the extent necessary, any capital gains fee under the Investment Advisory Agreement that exceeds what would have been paid to Capitala in the aggregate over such two-year period under the prior advisory agreement. 
 On the date of the Closing, the Company changed its name from Capitala Finance Corp. to Logan Ridge Finance Corporation and on July 2, 2021, the Company s common stock began trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol LRFC.

Consolidation 
 As provided under ASC 946, the Company will generally not consolidate its investment in a company other than an investment company subsidiary or a controlled operating company whose business consists of providing services to the Company. Accordingly, the Company consolidated the results of the Company s wholly owned investment company subsidiaries (Fund II, Fund III, CBL, and the Taxable Subsidiaries) in its consolidated financial statements. 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenue primarily from the periodic cash interest we collect on our debt investments. In addition, most of our debt investments offer the opportunity to participate in a borrower s equity performance through warrant participation, direct equity ownership, or otherwise, which we expect to result in revenue in the form of dividends and/or capital gains. Further, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment fees, origination fees, amendment fees, diligence fees, monitoring fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and possibly consulting fees and performance-based fees. These fees will be recognized as they are earned.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 In the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, we have adopted various accounting policies that govern the application of U.S. GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. While all of these policies are important to understanding our consolidated financial statements, certain accounting policies and estimates are considered critical due to their impact on the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods covered by such consolidated financial statements. We have identified investment valuation, revenue recognition, and income taxes as our most critical accounting estimates. We continuously evaluate our estimates, including those related to the matters described below. Because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions we make, actual results could materially differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A discussion of our critical accounting policies follows. 
 Valuation of Investments 
 Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains or losses on investments are calculated using the specific identification method as the difference between the net proceeds received (excluding prepayment fees, if any) and the amortized cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, and include investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are recognized. 
 Investments for which market quotations are available are typically valued at those market quotations. To validate market quotations, the Company will utilize a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and number of the quotations. 
 Debt that is not publicly traded but for which there are external pricing sources available as of the valuation date is valued using independent broker-dealer, market maker quotations or independent pricing services. The valuation committee, comprised of members of the Investment Adviser, (the Valuation Committee subjects these quotes to various criteria including, but not limited to, the number and quality of quotes, the deviation among the quotes and information derived from 
 31 

analyzing the Company s own transactions in such investments throughout the reporting period. Generally, such investments are categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, unless the Valuation Committee determines that the quality, quantity or deviation among quotes warrants significant adjustment to the inputs utilized. 
 The Board has designated the Investment Adviser as its valuation designee pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, and in that role the Investment Adviser is responsible for performing fair value determinations relating to all of the Company's investments, including periodically assessing and managing any material valuation risks and establishing and applying fair value methodologies, in accordance with valuation policies and procedures that have been approved by the Board. The Board remains ultimately responsible for fair value determinations under the 1940 Act and satisfies its responsibility through oversight of the valuation designee in accordance with Rule 2a-5. Investments that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available, as is expected to be the case for substantially all of the Company s investments, are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Investment Adviser, based on, among other things, input of independent third-party valuation firm(s). 
 The Investment Adviser undertakes a multi-step valuation process, which includes, among other procedures, the following: 
 The Company s quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued using certain inputs, among others, provided by the investment professionals responsible for the portfolio investment in conjunction with the Company s portfolio management team. The Company utilizes an independent valuation firm to provide valuation on each material illiquid security at least once every trailing 12-month period, 

Preliminary valuations are reviewed and discussed with management of the Investment Adviser and investment professionals; and 

the Investment Adviser will review the valuations and determine the fair value of each investment. Valuations that are not based on readily available market quotations will be valued in good faith based on, among other things, the input of, where applicable, third parties. 

As part of the valuation process, the Investment Adviser may consider other information and may use valuation methods including but not limited to (i) market quotes for similar investments, (ii) recent trading activity, (iii) discounting forecasted cash flows of the investment, (iv) models that consider the implied yields from comparable debt, (v) third party appraisal, (vi) sale negotiations and purchase offers received from independent parties and (vii) estimated value of underlying assets to be received in liquidation or restructuring. 
 Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of such investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be realized. Further, such investments are generally less liquid than publicly traded securities and may be subject to contractual and other restrictions on resale. If the Company were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, it could realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material. 
 In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected herein. 
 Under existing accounting guidance, fair value is defined as the price that the Company would receive upon selling an investment or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction to a market participant in the principal or most advantageous market for the investment. This accounting guidance emphasizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable market inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. Inputs may be observable or unobservable. Observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. 
 The Company classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchy as defined by current accounting guidance: 
 Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible to the Company. 
 Level 2: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other observable inputs other than quoted prices. 
 Level 3: Significant inputs that are unobservable for an asset or liability. 
 A financial instrument s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Investments for which no external pricing sources are available as of the valuation date are included in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
 As a practical expedient, the Company uses net asset value NAV as the fair value for its equity investment in Great Lakes Funding II LLC Great Lakes II Joint Venture ). The Great Lakes II Joint Venture records its underlying investments at fair value on a quarterly basis in accordance with the 1940 Act and U.S. GAAP. 
 Valuation Techniques 
 Enterprise Value Waterfall Approach 
 The enterprise value waterfall approach determines an enterprise value based on EBITDA multiples of publicly traded companies that are considered similar to the subject portfolio company. The Company considers a variety of items in determining a reasonable pricing multiple, including, but not limited to, operating results, budgeted projections, growth, size, risk, profitability, leverage, management depth, diversification, market position, supplier or customer dependence, asset utilization, liquidity metrics, and access to capital markets. EBITDA of the portfolio company is adjusted for non-recurring items in order to reflect a normalized level of earnings that is representative of future earnings. In certain instances, the Company may also utilize revenue multiples to determine enterprise value. When available, the Company may assign a pricing multiple or value its investments based on the value of recent investment transactions in the subject portfolio company or offers to purchase the portfolio company. The enterprise value is adjusted for financial instruments with seniority to the Company s ownership and for the effect of any instrument which may dilute the Company s investment in the portfolio company. The adjusted enterprise value is then apportioned based on the seniority and privileges of the Company s investments within the portfolio company. 
 Income Approach 
 The income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow methodology in which the Company estimates fair value based on the present value of expected cash flows discounted at a market rate of interest. The determination of a discount rate, or required rate of return, takes into account the portfolio company s fundamentals and perceived credit risk. Because the majority of the Company s portfolio companies do not have a public credit rating, determining a discount rate often involves assigning an implied credit rating based on the portfolio company s operating metrics compared to average metrics of similar publicly rated debt. Operating metrics include, but are not limited to, EBITDA, interest coverage, leverage ratio, return on capital, and debt to equity ratios. The implied credit rating is used to assign a base discount rate range 
 32 

based on publicly available yields on similarly rated debt securities. The Company may apply a premium to the discount rate utilized in determining fair value when performance metrics and other qualitative information indicate that there is an additional level of uncertainty about collectability of cash flows. 
 Asset Approach 
 The asset approach values an investment based on the value of the underlying collateral securing the investment. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 The Company s revenue recognition policies are as follows: 
 Interest income and payment-in-kind PIK interest income: Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. The Company has loans in the portfolio that contain a PIK interest provision. PIK interest, which represents contractually deferred interest added to the loan balance that is generally due at maturity, is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. PIK interest is not accrued if the Company does not expect the issuer to be able to pay all principal and interest when due. 
 Non-accrual investments: Management reviews all loans that become 90 days or more past due, or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected, for possible placement on non-accrual status. When the Company otherwise does not expect the borrower to be able to service its debt and other obligations, the Company will place the loan on non-accrual status and will generally cease recognizing interest income and PIK interest on that loan for financial reporting purposes. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment. The Company writes off any previously accrued and uncollected interest when it is determined that interest is no longer considered collectible. Non-accrual loans are returned to accrual status when the borrower s financial condition improves such that management believes current interest and principal payments are expected to be collected. 
 Gains and losses on investment sales and paydowns: Realized gains and losses on investments are recognized using the specific identification method. 
 Dividend income and payment-in-kind dividends: Dividend income is recognized on the date dividends are declared. The Company holds preferred equity investments in the portfolio that contain a PIK dividend provision. PIK dividends, which represent contractually deferred dividends added to the equity balance, are recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. The Company will typically cease accrual of PIK dividends when the fair value of the equity investment is less than the cost basis of the investment or when it is otherwise determined by management that PIK dividends are unlikely to be collected. If management determines that a decline in fair value is temporary in nature and PIK dividends are more likely than not to be collected, management may elect to continue accruing PIK dividends. 
 Original issue discount: Discounts received to par on loans purchased are capitalized and accreted into income over the life of the loan. Any remaining discount is accreted into income upon prepayment of the loan. 
 Other income: Origination fees (to the extent services are performed to earn such income upon closing), amendment fees, consent fees and other fees associated with investments in portfolio companies are recognized as income when they are earned. Prepayment penalties received by the Company for debt instruments repaid prior to the maturity date are recorded as income upon receipt. 
 Income Taxes 
 Prior to the Formation Transactions, the Legacy Funds were treated as partnerships for U.S. federal, state and local income tax purposes and, therefore, no provision has been made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for federal, state or local income taxes. In accordance with the partnership tax law requirements, each partner would include their respective components of the Legacy Funds taxable profits or losses, as shown on their Schedule K-1 in their respective tax or information returns. Subsequent to the Formation Transactions, the Legacy Funds became disregarded entities for tax purposes. 
 The Company has elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intends to comply with the requirements to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and, among other things, intends to make the requisite distributions to its stockholders which will relieve the Company from U.S. federal income taxes. 
 In order to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC, among other requirements, the Company is required to timely distribute to its stockholders at least 90.0 of its investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, for each fiscal tax year. The Company will be subject to a nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax of 4.0 on certain undistributed income if it does not distribute an amount at least equal to the sum of (i) 98.0 of its ordinary income for the calendar year, (ii) 98.2 of its capital gains in excess of capital losses for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year, and (iii) any ordinary income and capital gain net income that it recognized for preceding years, but were not distributed during such years, and on which it paid no U.S. federal income tax. 
 Depending on the level of taxable income earned in an excise tax year, the Company may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions into the next excise tax year and pay a 4.0 excise tax on such income, as required. To the extent that the Company determines that its estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions for U.S. federal excise tax purposes, the Company accrues excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned. Since the Company s IPO, the Company has not accrued or paid excise tax. 
 The tax years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, 2021 and 2020 remain subject to examination by U.S. federal, state, and local tax authorities. No material interest expense or penalties have been assessed for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. If the Company was required to recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits this would be recognized as income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations. 
 The Company s Taxable Subsidiaries record deferred tax assets or liabilities related to temporary book versus tax differences on the income or loss generated by the underlying equity investments held by the Taxable Subsidiaries. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company recorded a net deferred tax asset of zero. For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded a tax provision of zero. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the valuation allowance on the Company s net deferred tax asset was 3.4 million and 3.9 million, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized no change in the valuation allowance and a decrease of 0.5 million, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized an increase in the valuation allowance of 0.3 million and 0.2 million, respectively. 
 In accordance with certain applicable U.S. Treasury regulations and guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service, a publicly offered RIC may treat a distribution of its own stock as fulfilling its RIC distribution requirements if each stockholder may elect to receive its entire distribution in either cash or stock of the RIC, subject to a limitation on the aggregate amount of cash available to be distributed to all stockholders, which limitation must be at least 20.0 of the aggregate declared distribution. If too many stockholders elect to receive cash, the cash available for distribution must be allocated pro rata among the stockholders electing to receive cash (with the balance of the distribution paid in stock). In no event will any stockholder, electing to receive cash, receive less than 20.0 of its entire distribution in cash. If these and certain other requirements are met, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the amount of the dividend paid in stock will be equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead of stock. The Company has no current intention of paying dividends in shares of its stock in accordance with these Treasury regulations or other applicable IRS guidance.

U.S. GAAP provides guidance on thresholds, measurement, de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition that is intended to provide better financial statement comparability among different entities. 
 ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes ASC 740 ), provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented, and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements. ASC 740 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Company s U.S. federal income tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions deemed to meet a more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current period. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no uncertain tax positions. 
 The Company is required to determine whether a tax position of the Company is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. De-recognition of a tax benefit previously recognized could result in the Company recording a tax liability that could negatively impact the Company s net assets. 
 The Company has concluded that it was not necessary to record a liability for any such tax positions as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. However, the Company s conclusions regarding this policy may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, ongoing analyses of, and changes to, tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. 
 Portfolio and Investment Activity 
 The Company s investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. The Company offers customized financing to business owners, management teams and financial sponsors for change of ownership transactions, recapitalizations, strategic acquisitions, business expansion and other growth initiatives. The Company invests primarily in first lien loans, and, to a lesser extent, second lien loans and equity securities issued by lower middle-market companies and traditional middle-market companies. As of September 30, 2024, our portfolio consisted of investments in 59 portfolio companies with a fair value of approximately 175.6 million. As of December 31, 2023, our portfolio consisted of investments in 60 portfolio companies with a fair value of approximately 189.7 million. 
 Most of the Company s debt investments are structured as first lien loans. First lien loans may contain some minimum amount of principal amortization, excess cash flow sweep feature, prepayment penalties, or any combination of the foregoing. First lien loans are secured by a first priority lien in existing and future assets of the borrower and may take the form of term loans, delayed draw facilities, or revolving credit facilities. Unitranche debt, a form of first lien loan, typically involves issuing one debt security that blends the risk and return profiles of both senior secured and subordinated debt, bifurcating the loan into a first-out tranche and last-out tranche. As of September 30, 2024, none of the fair value of our first lien loans consisted of last-out loans. As of December 31, 2023, none of the fair value of our first lien loans consisted of last-out loans. In some cases, first lien loans may be subordinated, solely with respect to the payment of cash interest, to an asset based revolving credit facility. 
 The Company also invests in debt instruments structured as second lien loans. Second lien loans are loans which have a second priority security interest in all or substantially all of the borrower s assets, and in some cases, may be subject to the interruption of cash interest payments upon certain events of default, at the discretion of the first lien lender. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we made approximately 0.9 million of investments and had approximately 19.0 million in repayments and sales, resulting in net repayments and sales of approximately 18.1 million for the period. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we made approximately 6.1 million of investments and had approximately 23.2 million in repayments and sales, resulting in net repayment of approximately 17.1 million for the period. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made approximately 12.2 million of investments and had approximately 25.5 million in repayments and sales, resulting in net repayments and sales of approximately 13.3 million for the period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we made approximately 18.4 million of investments and had approximately 34.5 million in repayments and sales, resulting in net repayment of approximately 16.1 million for the period. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our debt investment portfolio, which represented 86.8 of the fair value of our total portfolio, had a weighted average annualized yield of approximately 12.3 (excluding income from non-accruals and collateralized loan obligations). As of September 30, 2024, 10.6 of the fair value of our debt investment portfolio was bearing a fixed rate of interest. As of December 31, 2023, our debt investment portfolio, which represented 82.0 of the fair value of our total portfolio, had a weighted average annualized yield of approximately 11.1 (excluding income from non-accruals and collateralized loan obligations). As of December 31, 2023, 13.6 of the fair value of our debt investment portfolio was bearing a fixed rate of interest. 
 The weighted average annualized yield is calculated based on the effective interest rate as of period end, divided by the outstanding par balance of our debt investments, excluding non-accrual investments and collateralized loan obligations. The weighted average annualized yield of our debt investments is not the same as a return on investment for our stockholders but, rather, relates to a portion of our investment portfolio and is calculated before the payment of all of our fees and expenses. There can be no assurance that the weighted average annualized yield will remain at its current level. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company s Adviser approved the fair value of the Company s investment portfolio of approximately 175.6 million in good faith in accordance with the Company s valuation procedures. The Company s Adviser approved the fair value of the Company s investment portfolio as of September 30, 2024 with input from third-party valuation firms based on information known or knowable as of the valuation date, including trailing and forward looking data. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had debt investments in three portfolio companies on non-accrual status with an aggregate amortized cost of 17.2 million and an aggregate fair value of 8.2 million, which represented 8.8 and 4.6 of the investment portfolio, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, we had debt investments in three portfolio companies on non-accrual status with aggregate amortized cost of 17.2 million and an aggregate fair value of 12.8 million, which represented 8.7 and 6.8 of the investment portfolio, respectively.

The income reported as interest income, PIK interest, and PIK dividend income is generally based on the stated rates as disclosed in our consolidated schedules of investments. Accretion of discounts received for purchased loans are included in interest income as an adjustment to yield. As a general rule, our interest income, PIK interest, and PIK dividend income are recurring in nature. 
 We also generate fee income primarily through origination fees charged for new investments, and secondarily via amendment fees, consent fees, prepayment penalties, and other fees. While fee income is typically non-recurring for each investment, most of our new investments include an origination fee; as such, fee income is dependent upon our volume of directly originated investments and the fee structure associated with those investments. 
 We earn dividends on certain equity investments within our investment portfolio. As noted in our consolidated schedules of investments, some investments are scheduled to pay a periodic dividend, though these recurring dividends do not make up a significant portion of our total investment income. We may receive, and have received, more substantial one-time dividends from our equity investments. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, total investment income decreased by less than 0.1 million, or 0.3 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease from the prior period was primarily driven by an decrease in PIK interest from 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, offset by a increase in interest income from 4.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in interest income is primarily due to a higher yielding interest earning debt portfolio for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total investment income decreased 0.2 million, or 1.5 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease from the prior period was driven by an decrease in interest income from 14.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 14.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in interest income is primarily due to a smaller interest earning debt portfolio for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. PIK interest decreased from 1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in PIK income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in prior year was primarily due to an decrease in income that was paid in-kind.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, operating expenses increased by 0.1 million, or 3.6 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest and financing expenses increased from 2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to higher cost of debt capital during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. General and administrative expenses increased from 0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to higher professional fees in the current year. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating expenses increased by 0.3 million, or 2.7 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest and financing expenses increased from 6.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 6.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to higher cost of debt capital during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Base management fees decreased from 2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 2.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to lower average assets under management. General and administrative expenses increased from 2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 2.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to lower professional fees in the prior year. 
 Net realized gain (loss) on sales of investments 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized 11.1 million and 11.2 million of net realized gains/(losses) on our portfolio investments, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized 0.1 million and 4.0 million of net realized losses on our portfolio investments, respectively. 
 Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments 
 Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments reflects the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized (13.3) million and (13.7) million of net change in unrealized depreciation on investments, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized (3.0) million and 1.3 million of net change in unrealized (depreciation) appreciation on investments, respectively.

Changes in net assets resulting from operations 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a net decrease and increase in net assets resulting from operations of (1.3) million and (0.2) million, respectively. Based on the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our basic and diluted per share net decrease in net assets resulting from operations was (0.50) and (0.06), respectively. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a net decrease and increase in net assets resulting from operations of (2.0) million and 0.6 million. Based on the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, our basic per share net (decrease) increase in net assets resulting from operations was (0.73) and 0.24, respectively. 
 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, there were draws of million on the KeyBank Credit Facility. The KeyBank Credit Facility includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, including certain limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens, as well as usual and customary events of default for revolving credit facilities of this nature. As of September 30, 2024, assets pledged to secure the KeyBank Credit Facility had a fair value of 136.8 million. 
 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.25 fixed-rate convertible notes due April 1, 2032 (the 2032 Convertible Notes ). The 2032 Convertible Notes are convertible, at the holder s option and at any time on or prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date, into such number of shares of the Company s common stock as is equal to the principal balance of the notes being converted on such date divided by the Conversion Price, as described below. The Conversion Price will be equal to the average Closing Sale Price for the five Trading Days immediately prior to the relevant Conversion Date, as those terms are defined in the Purchase Agreement, subject to certain anti-dilutive provisions, as further described in the Purchase Agreement. No holder of a 2032 Convertible Note will be entitled to convert any such note or portion thereof if such conversion would result in more than 7,500,000 in principal amount of 2032 Convertible Notes being converted in any such calendar quarter. The Company has determined that the embedded conversion option in the 2032 Convertible Notes is not required to be separately accounted for as a derivative under U.S. GAAP. On March 28, 2024, the Company obtained a BB+ rating from a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization NRSRO with respect to the 2032 Convertible Notes. The 2032 Convertible Notes have a fixed interest rate of 5.25 per annum payable semi-annually on March 31 and September 30 of each year, commencing on September 30, 2022, subject to a step up of 0.75 per annum to the extent that the 2032 Convertible Notes are downgraded below Investment Grade by an NRSRO or the 2032 Convertible Notes no longer maintain a rating from an NRSRO. Starting on March 28, 2024, as a result of the rating downgrade, the 2032 Convertible Notes have a fixed interest rate of 6.00 per annum. million in 2032 Convertible Notes outstanding.

In July 2022, pursuant to the requirements of a registration rights agreements entered into in connection with the offering described above, the Company completed an exchange offer pursuant to which all of the outstanding 2026 Notes were exchanged for notes with substantially identical terms, but that are registered under the Securities Act (which notes are also referred to herein as the 2026 Notes ). As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately million in aggregate principal amount of 2026 Notes outstanding. 

Asset Coverage Ratio 
 We are only allowed to borrow money such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 150 if certain requirements are met, after such borrowing, with certain limited exceptions. As of September 30, 2024, our asset coverage ratio was 186 . If our asset coverage ratio falls below 150 due a decline in the fair market of our portfolio, we may be limited in our ability to raise additional debt. 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 5.0 million in cash and cash equivalents. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 We have entered into two contracts under which we have material future commitments: the Investment Advisory Agreement, pursuant to which the Investment Adviser serves as our investment adviser, and the Administration Agreement, pursuant to which our Administrator agrees to furnish us with certain administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. Payments under the Investment Advisory Agreement in future periods will be equal to: (1) a percentage of the value of our gross assets; and (2) an incentive fee based on our performance. Payments under the Administration Agreement will occur on an ongoing basis as expenses are incurred on our behalf by our Administrator. 
 The Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement are each terminable by either party without penalty upon 60 days written notice to the other. If either of these agreements is terminated, the costs we incur under new agreements may increase. In addition, we will likely incur significant time and expense in locating alternative parties to provide the services we expect to receive under both our Investment Advisory Agreement and our Administration Agreement. Any new investment advisory agreement would also be subject to approval by our stockholders. 
 A summary of our significant contractual payment obligations as of September 30, 2024 are as follows (dollars in millions):

Distributions 
 In order to qualify as a RIC and to avoid corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on the income we timely distribute to our stockholders, we are required to distribute at least 90 of our net ordinary income and our net short-term capital gains in excess of net long-term capital losses, if any, to our stockholders on an annual basis. Additionally, to avoid a U.S. federal excise tax, we must distribute an amount at least equal to the sum of 98 of our ordinary income (during the calendar year) plus 98.2 of our capital gain net income (during each 12-month period ending on October 31 in that calendar year) plus any ordinary income and capital gain net income that we recognized for preceding years, but were not distributed during such years, and on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax. We made quarterly distributions to our stockholders for the first four full quarters subsequent to our IPO. To the extent we had income available, we made monthly distributions to our stockholders from October 30, 2014 until March 30, 2020. As announced on April 1, 2020, distributions, if any, will be made on a quarterly basis effective for the second quarter of 2020. Our stockholder distributions, if any, will be determined by our Board on a quarterly basis. Any distributions to our stockholders will be declared out of assets legally available for distribution. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company made a distribution of 0.33 and 0.98 per share, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company made a distribution of 0.26 and 0.66 per share, respectively. 
 We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of our distributions from time to time, and from time to time we may decrease the amount of our distributions. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage requirements applicable to us as a BDC under the 1940 Act. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we will suffer adverse tax consequences, including the possible loss of our qualification as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions. 
 To the extent our taxable earnings fall below the total amount of our distributions for that fiscal year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, the source of a distribution to our stockholders may be the original capital invested by the stockholder rather than our income or gains. Stockholders should read any written disclosure accompanying any stockholder distribution carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution is our ordinary income or capital gains. 
 We have adopted an opt out dividend reinvestment plan DRIP for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a distribution, then stockholders cash distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock unless a stockholder specifically opts out of our DRIP. If a stockholder opts out, that stockholder will receive cash distributions. Although distributions paid in the form of additional shares of our common stock will generally be subject to U.S. federal, state, and local taxes in the same manner as cash distributions, stockholders participating in our DRIP will not receive any corresponding cash distributions with which to pay any such applicable taxes. 
 Tax characteristics of all distributions paid are reported to stockholders on Form 1099 after the end of the calendar year. Distributions may be subject to reclassification based on future dividends and operating results and will not be determined until the end of the year. 
 Related Parties

On July 1, 2021, we entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with the Investment Adviser. The Company is externally managed by the Investment Adviser, an affiliate of BC Partners, pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement. Mr. Goldthorpe, an interested member of the Board, has a direct or indirect pecuniary interest in the Investment Adviser. The Investment Adviser is a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. The Investment Adviser is an affiliate of BC Partners Advisors L.P. for U.S. regulatory purposes. Mount Logan Capital Inc. is the ultimate control person of the Investment Adviser. 
 Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, fees payable to the Investment Adviser equal (i) the Base Management Fee and (ii) the Incentive Fee. Unless earlier terminated as described below, the Investment Advisory Agreement will remain in effect from year-to-year if approved annually by a majority of the Board or by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares, and, in each case, a majority of the independent directors. 
 Pursuant to the Administration Agreement, the Administrator provides administrative services to the Company necessary for the operations of the Company, which include providing to the Company office facilities, equipment and clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services at such facilities and such other services as the Administrator, subject to review by the Board, shall from time to time deem to be necessary or useful to perform its obligations under the applicable Administration Agreement. The Administrator also provides to the Company portfolio collection functions for and is responsible for the financial and other records that the Company is required to maintain and prepares, prints and disseminates reports to the Company's stockholders and reports and all other materials filed with the SEC. 
 For providing these services, facilities and personnel, the Company reimburses the Administrator the allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including the Company's allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of its chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs. 
 On April 10, 2023, superseding a prior exemptive order granted on October 23, 2018, the SEC issued an order granting an application for exemptive relief to us and certain of our affiliates that allows BDCs managed by the Investment Adviser, including Logan Ridge, to co-invest, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, in certain private placement transactions, with other funds managed by the Investment Adviser or its affiliates, certain proprietary accounts of the Investment Adviser or its affiliates and any future funds that are advised by the Investment Adviser or its affiliated investment advisers. Under the terms of the exemptive order, in order for Logan Ridge to participate in a co-investment transaction, a required majority (as defined in Section 57(0) of the 1940 Act) of Logan Ridge's independent directors must conclude that (i) the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to Logan Ridge and its stockholders and do not involve overreaching with respect of Logan Ridge or its stockholders on the part of any person concerned, and (ii) the proposed transaction is consistent with the interests of Logan Ridge's stockholders and is consistent with Logan Ridge's investment objectives and strategies and certain criteria established by the Board. We believe this relief may not only enhance our ability to further our investment objectives and strategies, but may also increase favorable investment opportunities for us, in part by allowing us to participate in larger investments, together with our co-investment affiliates, than would be available to us in the absence of such relief. 
 Prior to July 1, 2021, we were party to an administration agreement with our then administrator, Capitala Advisors Corp. As administrator, Capitala Advisors Corp. provided us with the office facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. On July 1, 2021, we entered into a new Administration Agreement with our current Administrator, BC Partners Management LLC. Pursuant to the terms of the Administration Agreement, our Administrator provides us with the office facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitativ e Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates may affect both our cost of funding and our interest income from portfolio investments and cash and cash equivalents. 
 We may hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options, and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not engage in hedging activities. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we held 48 securities bearing a variable rate of interest. Our variable rate investments represent approximately 89.4 of the fair value of our total debt investments. As of September 30, 2024, none of our variable rate securities were yielding interest at a rate equal to the established interest rate floor. As of September 30, 2024, we had 39.1 million outstanding on our KeyBank Credit Facility, which has a variable rate of interest at one-month SOFR + 2.80 , subject to an interest rate floor of 0.40 . As of September 30, 2024, all of our other interest paying liabilities, consisting of 50.0 million in 2026 Notes and 10.0 million in 2032 Convertible Notes, were bearing interest at a fixed rate. 
 Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. Because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. In addition, in a prolonged low interest rate environment, including a reduction of LIBOR to zero, the difference between the total interest income earned on interest earning assets and the total interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities may be compressed, reducing our net interest income and potentially adversely affecting our operating results. 
 Based on our September 30, 2024 consolidated statements of assets and liabilities, the following table shows the annual impact on net income (excluding the potential related incentive fee impact) of base rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate floors for variable rate securities) assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure (dollars in thousands):

Item 4. Cont rols and Procedures 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As of September 30, 2024 (the end of the period covered by this report), we, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in periodic SEC filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Notably, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. 
 Remediation of Previously Disclosed Material Weakness 
 As previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, we identified a material weakness in the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Specifically, as previously disclosed, in March 2024, we identified a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting related to our failure to satisfy the gross income requirement to maintain our special tax status as a RIC for the years ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022. 
 In response to such material weakness, management took certain actions to further enhance effective internal control measures to improve our internal control over financial reporting and to remediate the identified material weakness. Corrective actions to remediate the control deficiencies identified above, included incorporation of additional controls over the data used regarding the calculation of the gross income test for purposes of evaluating the Company s qualification as a RIC. Management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated these remedial efforts and concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our planned actions to enhance our processes and controls have addressed this material weakness. We are committed to the continuous improvement of our internal control over financial reporting and will continue to diligently review our internal control over financial reporting. 
 (b) Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 

Except for the remediation indicated above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We and our subsidiaries are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, is any material legal proceeding threatened against us or our subsidiaries. From time to time, we, or our subsidiaries may be a party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies. Our business is also subject to extensive regulation, which may result in regulatory proceedings against us.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 Other than the shares issued pursuant to our DRIP, we did not engage in any sales of unregistered securities during the period covered in this report. We issued a total of 68 shares of common stock under our DRIP during the three months ended September 30, 2024. This issuance was not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the aggregate value of the shares of our common stock issued under our DRIP was less than 0.1 million.

(1) On March 6, 2023, the Company s Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program, whereby the Company could repurchase up to an aggregate of 5.0 million of its outstanding shares of common stock in the open market. The repurchase program did not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares, and all repurchases were made in accordance with SEC Rule 10b-18 and accomplished through a Rule 10b5-1 plan, which set certain restrictions on the method, timing, price and volume of share repurchases. On March 11, 2024, the Board authorized the extension of the share repurchase program for an additional year and increased the aggregate available balance to 5.0 million. Unless extended or discontinued by the Board, the repurchase program will terminate on March 31, 2025. The repurchase program may be extended, modified or discontinued at any time for any reason without prior notice.
