CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements, as that term is defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 PSLRA ), Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Forward-looking statements include statements about our expectations, beliefs or intentions regarding our product development efforts, business, financial condition, results of operations, strategies or prospects, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that these statements do not relate strictly to historical or current matters. Rather, forward-looking statements relate to anticipated or expected events, activities, trends or results as of the date they are made. Because forward-looking statements relate to matters that have not yet occurred, these statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Many factors could cause our actual activities or results to differ materially from the activities and results anticipated in forward-looking statements. These factors include those described below and in Item 1A-Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and described from time to time in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements, except to the extent required by applicable law. We intend that all forward-looking statements be subject to the safe-harbor provisions of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and reflect our views as of the date they are made with respect to future events and financial performance. 
 
 Risks and uncertainties, the occurrence of which could adversely affect our business, include the following: 

we have had a history of losses and may not generate sustained positive cash flow sufficient to fund our operations and research and development programs; 

our need for, and ability to obtain, additional financing when needed on favorable terms, or at all; 

adverse results in material litigation matters or governmental inquiries; 

the risks inherent in developing, obtaining regulatory approvals for and commercializing new, commercially viable and competitive products and treatments; 

our research and development activities may not result in commercially viable products; 

that earlier clinical results of effectiveness and safety may not be reproducible or indicative of future results; 

that we may not generate or sustain profits or cash flow from our laboratory operations or substantial revenue from NGENLA, Rayaldee and our other pharmaceutical and diagnostic products; 

our ability to manage our growth and our expanded operations; 

that our acquisition of ModeX Therapeutics, Inc. will be successful and the products in the R D pipeline will ultimately be commercialized; 

that currently available over-the-counter and prescription products, as well as products under development by others, may prove to be as or more effective than our products for the indications being studied; 

our ability and our distribution and marketing partners ability to comply with regulatory requirements regarding the sales, marketing and manufacturing of our products and product candidates and the operation of our laboratories; 

the performance of our third-party distribution partners, licensees and manufacturers over which we have limited control; 

changes in regulation and policies in the U.S. and other countries, including increasing downward pressure on healthcare reimbursement; 

increased competition, including price competition; 

our success is dependent on the involvement and continued efforts of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; 

integration challenges for acquired businesses;

million in cash, which is subject to certain adjustments as set forth in the Labcorp Asset Purchase Agreement. These assets were part of our diagnostics segment and include BioReference's laboratory testing businesses focused on clinical diagnostics, reproductive health, and women's health across the United States, excluding BioReference's New York and New Jersey operations. 
 
 Pursuant to the Labcorp Asset Purchase Agreement, a total of approximately million was withheld at closing and deposited by Labcorp into an escrow account with an escrow account to satisfy potential indemnity claims. The escrow will be released to the Company on the twelve -month anniversary of the closing date, subject to any outstanding or liquidated indemnity claims. The Company recorded the escrow within other current assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 
 We recognized a gain of million from the BioReference Transaction for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

of our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar (USD). This compares to for the same period in 2023. Our financial statements are reported in USD; therefore, fluctuations in exchange rates affect the translation of foreign-denominated revenue and expenses. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, our most significant currency exchange rate exposures were to the Euro and the Chilean Peso. Gross accumulated currency translation adjustments, recorded as a separate component of shareholders equity, totaled million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 We are subject to foreign currency transaction risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates between the time a transaction is initiated and settled. To mitigate this risk, we use foreign currency forward contracts. These contracts fix an exchange rate, allowing us to offset potential losses (or gains) caused by exchange rate changes at the settlement date. As of September 30, 2024 , we held open foreign exchange forward contracts related to inventory purchases on letters of credit. As of December 31, 2023, we held open foreign exchange forward contracts related to inventory purchases on letters of credit. These contracts matured monthly through January 2024 with a total notional value of approximately million.

 million and million, respectively. Inventory obsolescence expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was million and million, respectively. 
 
 billion and billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. 
 
 Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, licensing and other transactions are generally recognized at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. At acquisition, we generally determine the fair value of intangible assets, including IPR D, using the income method. 
 
 Subsequent to their acquisition, goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested at least annually as of October 1 for impairment, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. 
 
 Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit for goodwill impairment is highly sensitive to changes in projections and assumptions and changes in assumptions could potentially lead to impairment. We perform sensitivity analyses around our assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the results of our testing. Ultimately, potential changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and result in an impairment if the fair value of such reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Goodwill was million and million, respectively, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . 
 
 Net intangible assets other than goodwill were million on each of September 30, 2024 , and December 31, 2023 , with IPR D accounting for million on each date. Considering the high risk nature of research and development and the industry s success rate of bringing developmental compounds to market, IPR D impairment charges may occur in future periods. Estimating the fair value of IPR D for potential impairment is highly sensitive to changes in projections and assumptions and changes in assumptions could potentially lead to impairment. 
 
 Upon regulatory approval, IPR D assets are classified as finite-lived intangible assets. These assets are then amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. If a project is abandoned, the associated IPR D costs are immediately expensed. We also regularly assess finite-lived intangible assets for impairment. This assessment involves comparing the carrying amount of an asset, which is its cost minus accumulated amortization, to its estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized to reflect the difference between the asset's carrying amount and its fair value. 

While we believe our estimates and assumptions used in impairment testing (including for goodwill and IPR D) are reasonable and reflect those used by market participants, there is a potential risk of material impairment charges. Based on the current financial performance of our diagnostics segment and our Ireland reporting unit (which includes Eirgen and Rayaldee ), we could be subject to such charges if their future performance deviates from our current estimates and assumptions. For reference, the combined goodwill of these units totaled million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. 
 
 We amortize intangible assets with definite lives on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from to years. We use the straight-line method of amortization as there is no reliably determinable pattern in which the economic benefits of our intangible assets are consumed or otherwise used up. Amortization expense was million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively. Amortization expense was million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively. 
 
 years, machinery, medical and other equipment - - years, furniture and fixtures - - years, leasehold improvements - the lesser of their useful life or the lease term, buildings and improvements - - years, and automobiles - - years. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Assets held under finance leases are included within Property, plant and equipment, net in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and are amortized over the shorter of their useful lives or the expected term of their related leases.

primarily due to the valuation allowance against certain U.S. and non-U.S. deferred tax assets, the relative mix in earnings and losses in the U.S. versus foreign tax jurisdictions, and the impact of certain discrete tax events and operating results in tax jurisdictions which do not result in a tax benefit. 
 
 Included in Other long-term liabilities is an accrual of million related to uncertain tax positions involving income recognition. In connection with an examination of foreign tax returns for the 2015 through 2021 tax years, a foreign taxing authority has issued an income tax assessment of approximately million (including interest). We are appealing this assessment, as we believe, other than for uncertain tax positions for which we have reserved, the issues are without technical merit. We intend to exhaust all judicial remedies necessary to resolve the matter as necessary, which could be a lengthy process. There can be no assurance that this matter will be resolved in our favor, and an adverse outcome, or any future tax examinations involving similar assertions, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our intangible assets and goodwill relate principally to our completed acquisitions of OPKO Renal, OPKO Biologics, EirGen, BioReference and ModeX. We amortize intangible assets with definite lives on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives by asset class are as follows: technologies - - years, customer relationships - - years, product registrations - - years, covenants not to compete - years, trade names - - years, other - years. We do not anticipate capitalizing the cost of product registration renewals, rather we expect to expense these costs, as incurred. Our goodwill is not tax deductible for income tax purposes in any jurisdiction in which we operate.

 On January 14, 2022, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the GeneDx Merger Agreement with GeneDx Holdings Corp. (f/k/a Sema4 Holdings Corp.), a Delaware corporation GeneDx Holdings ), pursuant to which GeneDx Holdings acquired our former subsidiary, GeneDx LLC (formerly GeneDx, Inc.

Investments in variable interest entities 
 
 We have determined that we hold variable interests in LeaderMed and Zebra. We made this determination as a result of our assessment that they do not have sufficient resources to carry out their principal activities without additional financial support. 
 
 In September 2021, we and LeaderMed, a pharmaceutical development company with operations based in Asia, formed a joint venture to develop, manufacture and commercialize two of OPKO s clinical stage, long-acting drug products in Greater China and eight other Asian territories. Under the terms of the agreements, we granted the joint venture exclusive rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize (a) OPK88003, an oxyntomodulin analog being developed for the treatment of obesity and diabetes, and (b) Factor VIIa-CTP, a novel long acting coagulation factor being developed to treat hemophilia, in exchange for shares ownership interest in the joint venture. In addition, we received an upfront payment of million and will be reimbursed for clinical trial material and technical support we provide the joint venture. 
 
 In order to determine the primary beneficiary of the joint venture, we evaluated our investment and our related parties investment, as well as our investment combined with the related parties investment to identify if we had the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the joint venture. Based on the capital structure, governing documents and overall business operations of the joint venture, we determined that, while a VIE, we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the joint venture s economic performance and do not have an obligation to fund expected losses. We did determine that we can significantly influence control of the joint venture through our board representation and voting power. Therefore, we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the joint venture s operations and account for our investment in the joint venture under the equity method. 
 
 We own shares of Zebra s Series A- 2 Preferred Stock and shares of Zebra restricted common stock (ownership at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . Zebra is a privately held biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of biosuperior antibody therapeutics and complex drugs. Dr. Richard Lerner, M.D., a former member of our Board of Directors, was a founder of Zebra. Dr. Frost serves as a member of Zebra s Board of Directors.

 On July 17, 2024, the Company completed a private offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes (the 2044 Notes ), pursuant to a note purchase agreement dated July 17, 2024 the 2044 Note Purchase Agreement), by and among the Company, certain purchasers from time to time party thereto, the Company s wholly owned subsidiaries OPKO Biologics OBL and EirGen as guarantors (OBL and EirGen collectively, the 2044 Note Guarantors ), and HCR Injection SPV, LLC, as agent. 
 
 The 2044 Notes mature on July 17, 2044 and bear interest at the 3 -month Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) subject to a per annum floor, plus per annum. Interest is payable on the 2044 Notes on a quarterly basis determined by profit share payments received by EirGen pursuant to the profit share arrangement with Pfizer, Inc. (the Royalty Payments set forth in the Restated Pfizer Agreement (as defined and described in Note 14 ). In the event that the aggregate amount of the Royalty Payments received by EirGen during the quarter preceding any quarterly interest payment date are less than the accrued and unpaid interest payable on such date, the excess interest payable on such date shall be paid-in-kind and added to the outstanding principal amount of the 2044 Notes. The Company will be required to pay the noteholders a exit fee in connection with any repayment in full of the 2044 Notes, whether at maturity or otherwise. In addition, in the event that the Company repays the 2044 Notes in full prior to the maturity date, the Company will be required to pay the noteholders a make whole payment in an amount necessary such that the noteholders shall have received aggregate payments of principal, interest and fees in respect of the 2044 Notes equal to at least of the initial principal amount of the 2044 Notes, in the event that such prepayment shall occur on or prior to July 17, 2029, or of the initial principal amount of the 2044 Notes, in the event that such prepayment shall occur following July 17, 2029. If the 2044 Notes have not been fully repaid by the maturity date, the Company may elect to either repay the unpaid balance of the principal amount in full, together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon and the exit fee, or elect to transfer of all future Royalty Payments to the agent and the noteholders in satisfaction of the outstanding 2044 Notes. The Company may authorize up to an additional in additional 2044 Notes to the purchasers on the same terms and conditions of the initial 2044 Notes. The 2044 Notes are secured by the Royalty Payments, and the 2044 Note Guarantors have guaranteed the obligations under the 2044 Notes by granting a security interest in certain assets of the 2044 Note Guarantors. The 2044 Note Purchase Agreement contains customary terms and covenants, including negative covenants, such as limitations on indebtedness, liens, amendments to certain material contracts and disposition of assets. 

2029 Convertible 144A Notes 
 
 In January 2024, we completed a private offering of million aggregate principal amount of our Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 (the 2029 Convertible 144A Notes in accordance with the terms of a note purchase agreement (the 144A Note Purchase Agreement entered into by and between the Company and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (the Initial Purchaser ). 
 
 Net proceeds from the 2029 Convertible 144A Notes issuance totaled approximately million after deducting fees and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We allocated approximately million of these net proceeds to repurchase shares of our Common Stock. These repurchases were from purchasers of the 2029 Convertible 144A Notes in privately negotiated transactions effected with or through the Initial Purchaser or its affiliate. The purchase price per share of the Common Stock in these transactions equaled the closing sale price of per share of Common Stock on January 4, 2024. 
 
 Contemporaneously with the closing of the offering of the 2029 Convertible 144A Notes on January 9, 2024, we issued and sold approximately million aggregate principal amount of our Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 (the 2029 Convertible Affiliate Notes and, together with the 2029 Convertible 144A Notes, the 2029 Convertible Notes pursuant to the terms of a note purchase agreement entered into on January 4, 2024 the Affiliate Note Purchase Agreement by and among the Company and certain investors, Frost Gamma Investments Trust, a trust controlled by Dr. Phillip Frost, and Dr. Jane H. Hsiao (collectively, the Affiliate Purchasers ). Pursuant to the Affiliate Note Purchase Agreement, we issued and sold the 2029 Convertible Affiliate Notes to the Affiliate Purchasers in exchange for the entirety of the million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 2023 Convertible Notes held by the Affiliate Purchasers, together with approximately million of accrued but unpaid interest thereon. 
 
 On January 9th, 2024, we recorded the million value of the embedded derivative liability within the 2029 Convertible Notes as a debt discount. To determine the fair value of this derivative, we employed the Binomial Lattice model. Key inputs and assumptions for this valuation included our common stock price, the derivative's exercise price, risk-free interest rate, volatility, annual coupon rate, and remaining contractual term. We are amortizing the debt discount as non-cash interest expense over the term of the Notes. 
 
 From the date the Notes were issued through March 31, 2024, we observed an increase in the market price of our Common Stock which resulted in a million increase in the estimated fair value of our embedded derivatives recorded in Fair value changes of derivative instruments, net in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Effective April 1, 2024, the conversion option contained in the 2029 Convertible Notes met the classification of an equity component. As a result, we reclassified million of the embedded derivative liability from debt, non-current, to additional paid-in capital section of stockholders' equity on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 the 2029 Convertible 144A Notes are currently convertible. Holders may convert their 2029 Convertible Notes at their option prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding September 15, 2028 only under the following circumstances: 1 during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on March 31, 2024 and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our Common Stock for at least trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to of the applicable conversion price on each applicable trading day; 2 during the consecutive business day period after any consecutive trading day period (the convertible note measurement period in which the trading price per 1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the convertible note measurement period was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of our Common Stock and the applicable conversion rate on each such trading day; or 3 upon the occurrence of specified corporate events specified in the indenture governing the 2029 Convertible Notes. On or after September 15, 2028 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing conditions. Upon conversion of a note, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our Common Stock or a combination of cash and shares of our Common Stock, at our election. 

The conversion rate is initially equal to shares of Common Stock per 1,000 principal amount of notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share of Common Stock). The conversion rate for the 2029 Convertible Notes will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date of the notes, in certain circumstances we will increase the conversion rate of the 2029 Convertible Notes for a holder who elects to convert its notes in connection with such a corporate event. 
 
 We may not redeem the notes prior to the maturity date, and sinking fund is provided for the notes. If we undergo a fundamental change, holders may require us to purchase the notes in whole or in part for cash at a fundamental change purchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change purchase date. The 2029 Convertible Notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the notes, and equal in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated. The notes are effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries. 
 
 The indenture governing the notes provides for customary events of default which include (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods), among others, the following: nonpayment of principal or interest; breach of covenants or other agreements in the indenture; defaults in failure to pay certain other indebtedness; judgment defaults; and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency. Generally, if an event of default occurs and is continuing under the indenture, the trustee thereunder or the holders of at least in aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding may declare of the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any on all then-outstanding notes to be immediately due and payable. In certain circumstances, we may, for a period of time, elect to pay additional interest on the notes as the sole remedy to holders of the notes in the case of an event of default related to certain failures by us to comply with certain reporting covenants in the indenture.

million (including interest) related to uncertain tax positions involving income recognition in connection with an examination of foreign tax returns for the 2014 through 2020 tax years. We recognize that local tax law is inherently complex and the local taxing authorities may not agree with certain tax positions taken. We are appealing this assessment, as we believe, other than for uncertain tax positions for which we have reserved, the issues are without technical merit. We intend to exhaust all judicial remedies necessary to resolve the matter, as necessary, which could be a lengthy process. There can be no assurance that this matter will be resolved in our favor, and an adverse outcome, or any future tax examinations involving similar assertions, could have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 The Company and BioReference entered into (i) a settlement agreement (the Settlement Agreement ), effective July 14, 2022, with the United States of America, acting through the United States Department of Justice and on behalf of the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services OIG-HHS ), and the Defense Health Agency, acting on behalf of the TRICARE Program (collectively, the United States ), the Commonwealth of Massachusetts , the State of Connecticut, and the relator identified therein Relator ), and (ii) a Corporate Integrity Agreement, effective July 14, 2022 the CIA ), with the OIG-HHS, to resolve the investigation and related civil action concerning alleged fee-for-service claims for payment to the Medicare Program, the Medicaid Program, and the TRICARE Program (collectively, the Federal Health Care Programs ). 
 
 Under the Settlement Agreement, the Company and BioReference admitted only to having made payments to certain physicians and physicians groups for office space rentals for amounts that exceeded fair market value, and that it did not report or return any such overpayments to the Federal Health Care Programs (the Covered Conduct ). The Covered Conduct had commenced prior to the Company s acquisition of BioReference in 2015. With the exception of the Covered Conduct, the Company and BioReference expressly deny the allegations of the Relator as set forth in her civil action. The Company has paid a total of plus accrued interest from September 24, 2021 at a rate of per annum (the Settlement Amount ). The Settlement Amount consists of payable to the United States, payable to the Commonwealth and payable to Connecticut, in each case plus interest and was paid on July 18, 2022. Conditioned upon payment of the Settlement Amount, the United States, Massachusetts and Connecticut agreed to release the Company and BioReference from any civil or administrative monetarily liability arising from the Covered Conduct. Upon payment of the Settlement Amount and the amount due under a separate agreement with the Relator, the Relator released the Company and BioReference from any and all claims and potential claims. Further, in consideration of the obligations of the Company and BioReference in the Settlement Agreement and the CIA, the OIG-HHS released and refrained from instituting any administrative action seeking to exclude the Company or BioReference from participating in Medicare, Medicaid or other Federal health care programs as a result of the Covered Conduct. 
 
 Under the CIA, which has a term of 5 years, BioReference is required to, among other things: (i) maintain a Compliance Officer, a Compliance Committee, board review and oversight of certain federal healthcare compliance matters, compliance programs, and disclosure programs; (ii) provide management certifications and compliance training and education; (iii) establish written compliance policies and procedures to meet federal health care program requirements; (iv) create procedures designed to ensure compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute and/or Stark Law; (v) engage an independent review organization to conduct a thorough review of BioReference s systems, policies, processes and procedures related to certain arrangements; (vi) implement a risk assessment and internal review process; (vii) establish a disclosure program for whistleblowers; and (viii) report or disclose certain events and physician payments. The Company s or BioReference s failure to comply with its obligations under the CIA could result in monetary penalties and the exclusion from participation in Federal Health Care Programs. The CIA does not apply to any of the Company s subsidiaries other than BioReference, and its scope is generally limited to focus arrangements , which are those arrangements (as defined in the CIA) (i) between BioReference and any actual source or recipient of health care business or referrals and involves, directly or indirectly, the offer, payment, or provision of anything of value, or (ii) is between BioReference and any physician (or a physician s immediate family member). Most of these measures have already been implemented at BioReference. Following its acquisition of BioReference, the Company and BioReference implemented robust compliance measures that substantially align with those actions required under the CIA. 

On March 1, 2019, the Company received a Civil Investigative Demand CID from the U.S. Department of Justice DOJ ), Washington, DC. The CID sets forth document requests and interrogatories in connection with allegations that the Company and certain of its affiliates violated the False Claims Act and/or the Anti-Kickback Statute. On January 13, 2022, the Federal Government notified the U.S.D.C., Middle District Florida, Jacksonville Division, that it is declining to intervene in the matter but retains the right, via the Attorney General, to consent to any proposed dismissal of the action by the Court. On February 9, 2022, the States of Florida, Georgia, and Commonwealth of Massachusetts notified the U.S.D.C., Middle District Florida, Jacksonville Division, that they are declining to intervene in the matter. Notwithstanding the above declinations, on February 17, 2022, the Company was served with the Relator s Summons and Complaint Complaint ), which had been previously sealed. The Complaint alleges violations of the False Claims Act, the California Fraud Preventions Act, the Florida False Claims Act, the Massachusetts False Claims Act, the Georgia False Medicaid Claims Act, and illegal kickbacks. A motion to dismiss the Complaint was filed on April 25, 2022 and the case was dismissed in March 2023. However, the Relator filed an amended complaint in April 2023 and a second amended complaint, both of which were dismissed. Relator then filed an appeal in the U.S. Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals which is pending before the court following a failed mediation in April 2024. While management cannot predict the outcome of these matters at this time, the ultimate outcome could be material to our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 
 From time to time, we may receive inquiries, document requests, CIDs or subpoenas from the Department of Justice, OCR, CMS, various payors and fiscal intermediaries, and other state and federal regulators regarding investigations, audits and reviews. In addition to the matters discussed in this note, we are currently responding to CIDs, subpoenas, payor audits, and document requests for various matters relating to our laboratory operations. Some pending or threatened proceedings against us may involve potentially substantial amounts as well as the possibility of civil, criminal, or administrative fines, penalties, or other sanctions, which could be material. Settlements of suits involving the types of issues that we routinely confront may require monetary payments as well as corporate integrity agreements. Additionally, qui tam or whistleblower actions initiated under the civil False Claims Act may be pending but placed under seal by the court to comply with the False Claims Act s requirements for filing such suits. Also, from time to time, we may detect issues of non-compliance with federal healthcare laws pertaining to claims submission and reimbursement practices and/or financial relationships with physicians, among other things. We may avail ourselves of various mechanisms to address these issues, including participation in voluntary disclosure protocols. Participating in voluntary disclosure protocols can have the potential for significant settlement obligations or even enforcement action. The Company generally has cooperated, and intends to continue to cooperate, with appropriate regulatory authorities as and when investigations, audits and inquiries arise. 
 
 We are a party to other litigation in the ordinary course of business. While we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of legal matters, we accrue a liability for legal contingencies when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and that we can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss. It s reasonably possible the ultimate liability could exceed amounts currently estimated and we review established accruals and adjust them to reflect ongoing negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other relevant information. To the extent new information is obtained and our views on the probable outcomes of claims, suits, assessments, investigations or legal proceedings change, changes in our accrued liabilities would be recorded in the period in which such determination is made. Because of the high degree of judgment involved in establishing loss estimates, the ultimate outcome of such matters will differ from our estimates and such differences may be material to our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 , we were committed to make future purchases for inventory and other items in 2024 that occur in the ordinary course of business under various purchase arrangements with fixed purchase provisions aggregating approximately million 

The following are descriptions of our payors for laboratory services: 
 
 Healthcare Insurers. Reimbursements from healthcare insurers are based on negotiated fee-for-service schedules. Revenues consist of amounts billed, net of contractual allowances for differences between amounts billed and the estimated consideration we expect to receive from such payors, which considers historical denial and collection experience and the terms of our contractual arrangements. Adjustments to the allowances, based on actual receipts from the third -party payors, are recorded upon settlement. 
 
 Government Payors. Reimbursements from government payors are based on fee-for-service schedules set by governmental authorities, including traditional Medicare and Medicaid. Revenues consist of amounts billed, net of contractual allowances for differences between amounts billed and the estimated consideration we expect to receive from such payors, which considers historical denial and collection experience and the terms of our contractual arrangements. Adjustments to the allowances, based on actual receipts from the government payors, are recorded upon settlement. 
 
 Client Payors. Client payors include physicians, hospitals, employers, and other institutions for which services are performed on a wholesale basis, and are billed and recognized as revenue based on negotiated fee schedules. 
 
 Patients. Uninsured patients are billed based on established patient fee schedules or fees negotiated with physicians on behalf of their patients. Insured patients (including amounts for coinsurance and deductible responsibilities) are billed based on fees negotiated with healthcare insurers. Collection of billings from patients is subject to credit risk and ability of the patients to pay. Revenues consist of amounts billed net of discounts provided to uninsured patients in accordance with our policies and implicit price concessions. Implicit price concessions represent differences between amounts billed and the estimated consideration that we expect to receive from patients, which considers historical collection experience and other factors including current market conditions. Adjustments to the estimated allowances, based on actual receipts from the patients, are recorded upon settlement. 
 
 The complexities and ambiguities of billing, reimbursement regulations and claims processing, as well as considerations unique to Medicare and Medicaid programs, require us to estimate the potential for retroactive adjustments as an element of variable consideration in the recognition of revenue in the period the related services are rendered. Actual amounts are adjusted in the period those adjustments become known. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , we recorded million and million of negative revenue adjustments primarily due to the composition of patient pay mix. 
 
 Third-party payors, including government programs, may decide to deny payment or recoup payments for testing they contend were improperly billed or not medically necessary, against their coverage determinations, or for which they believe they have otherwise overpaid (including as a result of their own error), and we may be required to refund payments already received. Our revenues may be subject to retroactive adjustment as a result of these factors among others, including without limitation, differing interpretations of billing and coding guidance and changes by government agencies and payors in interpretations, requirements, and conditions of participation in various programs. We have processed requests for recoupment from third -party payors in the ordinary course of our business, and it is likely that we will continue to do so in the future. If a third -party payor denies payment for testing or recoups money from us in a later period, reimbursement for our testing could decline. 
 
 As an integral part of our billing compliance program, we periodically assess our billing and coding practices, respond to payor audits on a routine basis, and investigate reported failures or suspected failures to comply with federal and state healthcare reimbursement requirements, as well as overpayment claims which may arise from time to time without fault on the part of the Company. We may have an obligation to reimburse Medicare, Medicaid, and third -party payors for overpayments regardless of fault. We have periodically identified and reported overpayments, reimbursed payors for overpayments and taken appropriate corrective action. 
 
 Settlements with third -party payors for retroactive adjustments due to audits, reviews or investigations are also considered variable consideration and are included in the determination of the estimated transaction price for providing services. These settlements are estimated based on the terms of the payment agreement with the payor, correspondence from the payor and our historical settlement activity, including an assessment of the probability a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will occur when the uncertainty is subsequently resolved. Estimated settlements are adjusted in future periods as adjustments become known (that is, new information becomes available), or as years are settled or are no longer subject to such audits, reviews, and investigations. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , we had liabilities of approximately million and million, respectively, within Accrued expenses and Other long-term liabilities related to reimbursements for payor overpayments. 

The composition of revenue from services by payor for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was as follows:

Revenue from products 
 
 We recognize revenue from product sales when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services. The amount of revenue recorded reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Our estimates for sales returns and allowances are based upon the historical patterns of product returns and allowances taken, matched against the sales from which they originated, and our evaluation of specific factors that may increase or decrease the risk of product returns. Product revenues are recorded net of estimated rebates, chargebacks, discounts, co-pay assistance and other deductions (collectively, Sales Deductions as well as estimated product returns which are all elements of variable consideration. Allowances are recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time product revenues are recognized. The actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from our estimates. If actual results in the future vary from our estimates, we will adjust these estimates, which would affect revenue from products in the period such variances become known. 
 
 Rayaldee is distributed in the U.S. principally through the retail pharmacy channel, which initiates with the largest wholesalers in the U.S. (collectively, Rayaldee Customers ). In addition to distribution agreements with Rayaldee Customers, we have entered into arrangements with many healthcare providers and payors that provide for government-mandated or privately-negotiated rebates, chargebacks and discounts with respect to the purchase of Rayaldee . 
 
 We recognize revenue for shipments of Rayaldee at the time of delivery to customers after estimating Sales Deductions and product returns as elements of variable consideration utilizing historical information and market research projections. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we recognized million and million, respectively, in net product revenue from sales of Rayaldee . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , we recognized million and million, respectively, in net product revenue from sales of Rayaldee .

Taxes collected from customers related to revenues from services and revenues from products are excluded from revenues. 
 
 Revenue from intellectual property and other 
 
 We recognize revenues from the transfer of intellectual property generated through license, development, collaboration and/or commercialization agreements. The terms of these agreements typically include payment to us for one or more of the following: non-refundable, up-front license fees; development and commercialization milestone payments; funding of research and/or development activities; and royalties on sales of licensed products. Revenue is recognized upon satisfaction of a performance obligation by transferring control of a good or service to the customer. 

For research, development and/or commercialization agreements that result in revenues, we identify all material performance obligations, which may include a license to intellectual property and know-how, and research and development activities. In order to determine the transaction price, in addition to any upfront payment, we estimate the amount of variable consideration at the outset of the contract either utilizing the expected value or most likely amount method, depending on the facts and circumstances relative to the contract. We constrain (reduce) our estimates of variable consideration such that it is probable that a significant reversal of previously recognized revenue will not occur throughout the life of the contract. When determining if variable consideration should be constrained, we consider whether there are factors outside of our control that could result in a significant reversal of revenue. In making these assessments, we consider the likelihood and magnitude of a potential reversal of revenue. These estimates are re-assessed each reporting period as required. 
 
 Upfront License Fees: If a license to our intellectual property is determined to be functional intellectual property distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize revenue from nonrefundable, upfront license fees based on the relative value prescribed to the license compared to the total value of the arrangement. The revenue is recognized when the license is transferred to the customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the license. For licenses that are not distinct from other obligations identified in the arrangement, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time. If the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time, we apply an appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue from nonrefundable, upfront license fees. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjust the measure of performance and related revenue recognition. 
 
 Research and Development Activities: If we are entitled to reimbursement from our customers for specified research and development expenses, we account for them as separate performance obligations if distinct. We also determine whether the research and development funding would result in revenues or an offset to research and development expenses in accordance with provisions of gross or net revenue presentation. The corresponding revenues or offset to research and development expenses are recognized as the related performance obligations are satisfied. 
 
 BARDA Contract: Revenue from the BARDA Contract is generated under terms that are cost plus fee. We recognize revenue using the incurred costs output method to measure progress. Revenue will only be recognized when research and development services are performed to the extent of actual costs incurred. 
 
 Sales-based Milestone and Royalty Payments: Our customers may be required to pay us sales-based milestone payments or royalties on future sales of commercial products. We recognize revenues related to sales-based milestone and royalty payments upon the later to occur of (i) achievement of the customer s underlying sales or (ii) satisfaction of any performance obligation(s) related to these sales, in each case assuming the license to our intellectual property is deemed to be the predominant item to which the sales-based milestones and/or royalties relate. 
 
 Other Potential Products and Services: Arrangements may include an option for license rights, future supply of drug substance or drug product for either clinical development or commercial supply at the licensee s election. We assess if these options provide a material right to the licensee and if so, they are accounted for as separate performance obligations at the inception of the contract and revenue is recognized only if the option is exercised and products or services are subsequently delivered or when the rights expire. If the promise is based on market terms and not considered a material right, the option is accounted for if and when exercised. If we are entitled to additional payments when the licensee exercises these options, any additional payments are generally recorded in license or other revenues when the licensee obtains control of the goods, which is upon delivery. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 , revenue from the transfer of intellectual property and other was million, an increase from million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . This increase was primarily attributable to million from the BARDA Contract (as defined and described in Note 14 ). Gross profit share and royalty payments for NGENLA (Somatrogon) and Pfizer's Genotropin (Somatropin) also increased to million, compared with million for the same period in 2023. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , revenue from the transfer of intellectual property and other decreased to million from million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . This decrease was primarily due to one -time milestone payments received in 2023, including a 90.0 million payment related to NGENLA, a million payment from Merck for rights granted under the Merck Agreement, a million payment from VFMCRP triggered by the German price approval for Rayaldee , and a million payment from Nicoya upon submission of an investigational new drug application to China's Center for Drug Evaluation. See Note 14 for a description of the arrangements pursuant to which such milestone payments were received. Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , included million in gross profit share and royalty payments for NGENLA (Somatrogon) and Pfizer's Genotropin (Somatropin), compared to million in the same period in 2023, as well as million from the BARDA Contract during the 2024 period. 

million supplement to further advance the development of COVID- 19 multispecific antibodies. This increased funding supports the ongoing development, manufacturing, and execution of a Phase 1 clinical trial for a next-generation MSTAR multispecific antibody with broad neutralizing activity against known SARS-CoV- 2 variants. The BARDA Amendments also provided for BARDA's exercise of the option for the development of a multispecific protein antibody for influenza or another pathogen, with million allocated to cover the expanded work under this exercised option. These modifications increased the total value of the BARDA Contract from million to million, with the potential value if BARDA exercises all options thereunder to expand ModeX's services, increasing from million to million. 
 
 As part of the research program, gene-based delivery methods for the multispecific antibodies will be developed using mRNA or DNA vectors to leverage the body's natural protein production processes. BARDA will make periodic progress assessments, and the continuation of the BARDA Contract depends on ModeX s performance, the timeliness and quality of deliverables, and other factors. The BARDA Contract contains customary government contract provisions, including BARDA's right to terminate the contract in its discretion. 
 
 The Company evaluated the BARDA Contract under ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASC 606 ), and determined that the U.S. government meets the definition of a customer. The scope of the BARDA Contract includes preclinical, clinical, and manufacturing activities, as well as regulatory, quality assurance, management, and administrative activities. The research and development effort will progress in stages covering base and option segments, with ModeX completing specific tasks in each segment. 
 
 The Company identified three potential material promises under the BARDA Contract: (i) development of a tetravalent trispecific antibody for COVID- 19; (ii) development of a multispecific protein antibody for influenza or another pathogen; and (iii) nucleic acid delivery of a multispecific antibody for influenza or another pathogen. The Company determined the promise to develop a tetravalent trispecific antibody for COVID- 19 is a separate performance obligation, as it is distinct within the contract and provides standalone value. Similarly, the exercised option to develop a multispecific protein antibody for influenza or another pathogen is also a separate performance obligation. However, the Company determined that the nucleic acid delivery option does not offer incremental discounts beyond those typically provided for such goods and services, and therefore does not represent a material right. As such, the options in (iii) were not considered performance obligations at the outset of the BARDA Contract. 

The Company concluded that research and development services performed under the BARDA Contract would be recognized as revenue when research and development services are performed to the extent of actual costs incurred including a fixed fee and will be reimbursed by BARDA. Costs incurred represent work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control of the research and development to BARDA. Types of contract costs include labor, material, and third -party services. As such, the related BARDA revenue is recognized as revenue from transfer of intellectual property and other within the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we recorded million and million in revenue under the BARDA Contract. As of September 30, 2024 , the aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations, excluding unexercised contract options, was million. We expect to recognize this amount as revenue through February 2028.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rates 
 
 Approximately 22.3 of our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar (USD). This compares to 30.7 for the same period in 2023. Our financial statements are reported in USD; therefore, fluctuations in exchange rates affect the translation of foreign-denominated revenue and expenses. During the second quarter of 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, our most significant currency exchange rate exposures were to the Euro and the Chilean Peso. Gross accumulated currency translation adjustments, recorded as a separate component of shareholders equity, totaled 36.2 million and 34.6 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 We are subject to foreign currency transaction risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates between the time a transaction is initiated and settled. To mitigate this risk, we use foreign currency forward contracts. These contracts fix an exchange rate, allowing us to offset potential losses (or gains) caused by exchange rate changes at the settlement date. As of September 30, 2024, we held no open foreign exchange forward contracts related to inventory purchases on letters of credit. As of December 31, 2023, we held 52 open foreign exchange forward contracts related to inventory purchases on letters of credit. These contracts matured monthly through January 2024 with a total notional value of approximately 2.9 million. 

FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023

Revenue. Revenue from services for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by approximately 10.4 million, a decrease of 7.9 compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a 2.0 million reduction in clinical test reimbursement rates and an 8.4 million decrease in clinical test volume, of which 3.3 million was attributable to the BioReference Transaction. 
 
 Estimated collection amounts are subject to the complexities and ambiguities of billing, reimbursement regulations and claims processing, as well as considerations unique to Medicare and Medicaid programs, and require us to consider the potential for retroactive adjustments when estimating variable consideration in the recognition of revenue in the period the related services are rendered. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded 0.7 million and 1.5 million, respectively. These adjustments reflect changes in estimated implicit price concessions for services provided in prior periods, primarily due to shifts in the composition of our client mix 
 
 The composition of revenue from services by payor for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was as follows:

Cost of revenue . Cost of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 2.5 million, an increase of 2.3 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to 4.2 million in accruals set aside to cover volume shortfalls on contracts as a result of the Labcorp transaction. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses . Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 71.0 million and 48.8 million, respectively, representing an increase of 45.4 from the prior period. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to severance expense of 26.3 million, offset by a decrease in employee-related expenses, reflecting continued cost-reduction initiatives.

Revenue from products . Revenue from products for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 1.5 million or 3.8 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was largely attributable to lower Rayaldee sales, which generated 5.8 million of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 7.3 million for the same period in 2023. In addition, demand for our products in international operations increased, foreign currency fluctuations also negatively impacted revenue. 
 
 Revenue from transfer of intellectual property and other. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenue from the transfer of intellectual property and other was 13.2 million compared to 6.3 million for the prior year period. This increase was primarily attributable to 5.5 million from the BARDA Contract (as defined and described in Note 14 to our Quarterly Financials). Gross profit share and royalty payments for NGENLA (Somatrogon) and Pfizer's Genotropin (Somatropin) also increased to 7.0 million, compared with 4.9 million for the same period in 2023. 
 
 Cost of revenue . Cost of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 0.1 million, an increase of 0.5 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of revenue increased primarily due to a shift in product mix offset by favorable foreign currency exchange, which had a positive impact on cost of revenue, reducing it by 1.5 million.

Selling, general and administrative expenses . Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 15.2 million and 13.5 million, respectively, an increase of 12.3 from the prior year period. This increase was primarily driven by higher professional fees. Additionally, employee-related expenses also contributed to the increase in SG A in our international operations. 
 
 Research and development expenses . Research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 28.2 million and 18.9 million, respectively, an increase of 49.6 from the prior year period. Research and development expenses include external and internal expenses, partially offset by third-party grants and funding arising from collaboration agreements. External expenses include clinical and non-clinical activities performed by contract research organizations, lab services, purchases of drug and diagnostic product materials and manufacturing development costs. We track external research and development expenses by individual program for phase 3 clinical trials for drug approval and premarket approval for diagnostics tests, if any. Internal expenses include employee-related expenses such as salaries, benefits and equity-based compensation expense. Other internal research and development expenses are incurred to support overall research and development activities and include expenses related to general overhead and facilities.

Research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased primarily due to higher expenses at ModeX. This increase was driven by a combination of factors, including growth in our BARDA collaboration, advancements and expansion in our early-stage programs, and higher employee-related expenses. 
 
 Contingent consideration . Contingent consideration for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was zero, as compared to 1.1 million reversal of expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Contingent consideration for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to changes in assumptions regarding the timing of achievement of future milestones for OPKO Renal, and potential amounts payable to former stockholders of OPKO Renal in connection therewith, pursuant to our acquisition agreement in 2013. 
 
 Amortization of intangible assets . Amortization of intangible assets was 16.5 million and 16.5 million, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Amortization expense reflects the amortization of acquired intangible assets with defined useful lives. Our indefinite lived IPR D assets will not be amortized until the underlying development programs are completed. Upon obtaining regulatory approval by the FDA, the IPR D assets will be accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset and amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. The assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of approximately 12 years.

Operating loss for our unallocated corporate operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 12.1 million and 10.0 million, respectively, and principally reflect general and administrative expenses incurred in connection with our corporate operations. The increase in operating loss for our unallocated corporate operations was primarily due to an increase in employee-related expenses. 

Other 

Interest income . Interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 2.9 million and 1.0 million, respectively. The increase in interest income is driven by the yield obtained in our larger cash investment. 
 
 Interest expense . Interest expense increased to 17.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.4 million in the same period of 2023. The increase in interest expense was primarily driven by 14.6 million interest incurred on the 2029 Convertible Notes and the 2044 Notes, including amortization of deferred financing and debt issuance costs. This increase was partially offset by the extinguishment of our outstanding 2023 Convertible Notes and the repurchase of the 2025 Convertible Notes. 
 
 Fair value changes of derivative instruments, net . Fair value changes of derivative instruments, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was 1.0 thousand and 88.0 thousand of expense, respectively. Derivative expense was principally related to foreign currency forward exchange contracts at OPKO Chile. 
 
 Other income (expense), net . Other income (expense), net for the three months ended September 30, 2024, resulted in 48.6 million of income compared to 11.7 million of expense for the 2023 period. This was primarily driven by changes in the fair value of our investment in GeneDx Holdings (as defined in Note 6 to our Quarterly Financials). During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded income of 35.4 million related to this investment, compared to an expense of 8.3 million in the prior-year period. Additionally, we realized a gain of 10.5 million from the sale of 1,386,929 shares of GeneDx during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Foreign currency income of 4.1 million was recorded for the 2024 period, compared with a 3.8 million expense in the 2023 period. 
 
 Income tax provision . Our income tax provision for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 23.5 million and 6.1 million, respectively. This significant increase was primarily driven by a discrete expense related to the BioReference Transaction. While the U.S. federal statutory rate is 21 , our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 differed from this rate primarily due to the relative mix in earnings and losses in the U.S. versus foreign tax jurisdictions and operating results in tax jurisdictions which do not result in a tax benefit. 
 
 Loss from investments in investees . We have invested in certain early-stage companies that we perceive to have valuable proprietary technology and significant potential to create value for us as an equity holder. We account for these investments under the equity method of accounting, resulting in the recording of our proportionate share of their losses until our share of their loss exceeds our investment. Until the investees technologies are commercialized, if ever, we anticipate they will report net losses Loss from investments in investees was 3.0 thousand and 20.0 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Revenue . Revenue from services for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by approximately 13.5 million, a decrease of 3.5 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a 6.5 million reduction in clinical test reimbursement rates and an 7.0 million decrease in clinical test volume, of which 3.3 million was attributable to the BioReference Transaction. 
 
 Estimated collection amounts are subject to the complexities and ambiguities of billing, reimbursement regulations and claims processing, as well as considerations unique to Medicare and Medicaid programs, and require us to consider the potential for retroactive adjustments when estimating variable consideration in the recognition of revenue in the period the related services are rendered. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded 2.2 million and 19.8 million, respectively, of negative revenue adjustments due to changes in estimates of implicit price concessions for performance obligations satisfied in prior periods mainly due to the composition of patient pay mix.

Revenue from products . Revenue from products for nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 6.9 million or 5.5 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. While we experienced higher sales volumes in 2024 compared to 2023, this increase was more than offset by unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations of approximately 6.7 million from our international operations, resulting in an overall decrease in revenue. Additionally, revenue from sales of Rayaldee for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 19.9 million compared to 21.7 million recorded in the same period in 2023. 
 
 Revenue from transfer of intellectual property and other. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue from the transfer of intellectual property and other was 34.3 million compared to 165.9 million for the prior period. This decrease was primarily due to one-time milestone payments received in 2023, including a 90.0 million payment triggered by the FDA approval of NGENLA (Somatrogon), a 50.0 million payment from Merck for rights granted under the Merck Agreement (as defined and described in Note 14 to our Quarterly Financials), a 7.0 million payment from VFMCRP triggered by the German price approval for Rayaldee (as described in Note 14 to our Quarterly Financials) and a 2.5 million payment from Nicoya due to Nicoya s submission of the investigational new drug application to China's Center for Drug Evaluation pursuant to the Nicoya Agreement (as described in Note 14 to our Quarterly Financials). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue from the transfer of intellectual property and other reflects 18.9 million in gross profit share and royalty payments for NGENLA (Somatrogon) and Pfizer's Genotropin (Somatropin), compared with 11.8 million received in the same period in 2023. Furthermore, revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included 12.8 million from the BARDA Contract (as defined and described in Note 14 to our Quarterly Financials). 
 
 Cost of revenue . Cost of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 4.9 million, a decrease of 6.5 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 which was primarily driven by favorable foreign exchange fluctuations. Despite increased sales volumes during the period, which typically increases cost of revenue, we were able to achieve this decrease due to a combination of factors. Favorable foreign currency fluctuations positively impacted cost of revenue, and we also realized a 2.6 million reduction in Rayaldee cost of revenue resulting from a lower standard cost per bottle. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses . Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 44.3 million and 41.9 million, respectively, an increase of 5.7 from the prior year period. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was due to higher employee-related and professional expenses related to our international operations. 
 
 Research and development expenses . Research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 73.2 million and 68.3 million, respectively, an increase of 7.1 from the prior year period. Research and development expenses include external and internal expenses, partially offset by third-party grants and funding arising from collaboration agreements. External expenses include clinical and non-clinical activities performed by contract research organizations, lab services, purchases of drug and diagnostic product materials and manufacturing development costs. We track external research and development expenses by individual program for phase 3 clinical trials for drug approval and premarket approval for diagnostics tests, if any. Internal expenses include employee-related expenses such as salaries, benefits and equity-based compensation expense. Other internal research and development expenses are incurred to support overall research and development activities and include expenses related to general overhead and facilities.

Research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased primarily to growth in our BARDA collaboration and higher employee-related expenses. These increases were partially offset by a one-time payment to Sanofi of 12.5 million made in 2023 pursuant to the Sanofi In-License Agreement, which was triggered as a result of the Merck Agreement, and lower costs related to Somatrogon (hGH-CTP) following the closure of open-label extension studies in countries where it has received marketing authorization. 
 
 Contingent consideration . Contingent consideration for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was zero, as compared to a 1.0 million reversal of expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Contingent consideration for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to changes in assumptions regarding the timing of achievement of future milestones for OPKO Renal, and potential amounts payable to former stockholders of OPKO Renal in connection therewith, pursuant to our acquisition agreement in 2013. 
 
 Amortization of intangible assets . Amortization of intangible assets was 49.4 million for both for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Amortization expense reflects the amortization of acquired intangible assets with defined useful lives. Our indefinite lived IPR D assets will not be amortized until the underlying development programs are completed. Upon obtaining regulatory approval by the FDA, the IPR D assets will be accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset and amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. The assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of approximately 12 years.

Operating loss for our unallocated corporate operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 31.8 million and 31.8 million, respectively, and principally reflect general and administrative expenses incurred in connection with our corporate operations. 
 
 Other 
 
 Interest income . Interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 4.1 million and 3.1 million, respectively. The increase is driven by higher average cash and investment balances as a result of the cash received from the BioReference Transaction and the issuance of the 2044 Notes. 
 
 Interest expense . Interest expense increased to 33.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 10.1 million in the same period of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by interest incurred on the 2029 Convertible Notes and the 2044 Senior Secured Notes, including amortization of deferred financing and debt issuance costs. This increase was partially offset by the extinguishment of our outstanding 2023 Convertible Notes in connection with their exchange for 2029 Convertible Notes and the repurchase of a portion of the 2025 Convertible Notes. 
 
 Fair value changes of derivative instruments, net . Fair value changes of derivative instruments, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was 26.2 million and 0.8 million of expense, respectively. Derivative expense was principally related to the change in fair value on the 2029 Convertible Notes and on foreign currency forward exchange contracts at OPKO Chile. 
 
 Other income (expense), net . Other income (expense), net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 128.8 million of income, compared to 16.1 million of expense for the 2023 period. Other income (expense), net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, included 118.6 million of income and 19.9 million of expense, respectively, as a result of the change in the fair value of our investment in GeneDx Holdings (as defined in Note 6 to our Quarterly Financials). Furthermore, the nine months ended September 30, 2023, reflected 8.5 million of income due to GeneDx Holdings reaching specific revenue targets for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022. Finally, a foreign currency gain of 0.1 million was recorded for the 2024 period, compared with a 1.8 million loss in the 2023 period.

Income tax provision . Our income tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was a 21.9 million and 10.5 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to the relative mix in earnings and losses in the U.S. versus foreign tax jurisdictions, a discrete expense impact related to the BioReference Transaction, the impact of the payments under Merck Agreement, and operating results in tax jurisdictions which do not result in a tax benefit. 
 
 Loss from investments in investees . We have invested in certain early stage companies that we perceive to have valuable proprietary technology and significant potential to create value for us as an equityholder. We account for these investments under the equity method of accounting, resulting in the recording of our proportionate share of their losses until our share of their loss exceeds our investment. Until the investees technologies are commercialized, if ever, we anticipate they will report net losses. Loss from investments in investees was 7.0 thousand and 99.0 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 On September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of approximately 420.1 million. Cash used in operations of 139.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by a 121.5 million gain on the sale of assets related to the BioReference Transaction and 94.6 million change in fair value from equity securities. We also incurred general and administrative expenses related to our corporate operations and research and development activities. Cash from investing activities was 236.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflected both the proceeds from the BioReference Transaction and the sale of equity securities, offset by capital expenditures. Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 224.6 million primarily reflected net borrowings on our lines of credit, the issuance of our 2029 Convertible Notes, the issuance of the 2044 Notes, the redemption of the 2025 Notes, and repurchase of shares of our Common Stock. We have historically not generated sustained positive cash flow sufficient to offset our operating and other expenses, and our primary sources of cash have been from the public and private placement of equity and debt, as well as credit facilities available to us. 
 
 In September 2024, ModeX entered into the BARDA Amendment which increased funding by 26.9 million, for the ongoing development, manufacturing, and execution of a Phase 1 clinical trial for a next-generation MSTAR multispecific antibody with broad neutralizing activity against known variants of SARS-CoV-2. The BARDA Amendment also included BARDA's exercise of an option for the development of a multispecific protein antibody for influenza or another pathogen, with the additional funding allocated to cover the expanded work. These modifications increased the total value of the BARDA Contract to 110.0 million, with a potential value, of 205.0 million if BARDA exercises all options thereunder thereunder to expand MOdeX's services. The BARDA Contract covers a five-year period through February 2028. We expect this funding will support the development of a second novel multispecific antibody to SARS-CoV-2, from preclinical through Phase 1 trials, as well as preclinical work on gene-based expression of multispecific antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, including mRNA and/or DNA vectors. In addition, ModeX will begin development of influenza multispecifics with gene and/or protein delivery modalities. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate amount remaining to be funded by BARDA, which is subject to performance obligations and excluding unexercised contract options, is 96.0 million. 
 
 On September 16, 2024, the Company consummated the BioReference Transaction, pursuant to which Labcorp acquired select assets of the Company's subsidiary, BioReference. Labcorp paid to the Company aggregate consideration of 237.5 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments as set forth in the Labcorp Asset Purchase Agreement. The assets acquired by Labcorp include BioReference's laboratory testing businesses focused on clinical diagnostics, reproductive health, and women's health across the United States, excluding New York and New Jersey operations. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, the Company sold 1,386,929 shares of GeneDx Holdings common stock at various prices per share for approximately 46.7 million in aggregate proceeds. This sale reduced the Company's total ownership in GeneDx Holdings from 13.61 to 8.1 as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate value of our GeneDx Holdings investment was 92.2 million based on the closing market price of the GeneDx Holdings common stock. 
 
 On July 18, 2024, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 100 million of our Common Stock. Under this program, we may repurchase shares through various methods, including open market purchases, block trades, privately negotiated transactions and accelerated share repurchases, as well as pursuant to pre-set trading plans meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c) of the Exchange Act, and otherwise in compliance with applicable laws. The timing and volume of repurchases will depend on market conditions, our capital management, investment opportunities, and other factors. The program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares, has no set expiration date, and may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at our discretion. In connection with this new authorization, the Company repurchased 14,893,026 shares for 23.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

On July 17, 2024, we completed a private offering of 250 million aggregate principal amount of the 2044 Notes in accordance with the terms of the 2044 Note Purchase Agreement. The 2044 Notes are secured by the Company s profit share payments from Pfizer, received under the Restated Pfizer Agreement. The 2044 Notes bear interest at the 3-month SOFR plus 7.5 , subject to a minimum interest rate of 4.0 per annum. The 2044 Notes mature in July 2044, with interest-only payments required for the first four years. 
 
 In January 2024, we completed a private offering of 230.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 2029 Convertible 144A Notes in accordance with the terms of the 144A Note Purchase Agreement entered into by and between the Company and the Initial Purchaser. 
 
 The Company received approximately 220.0 million of net proceeds from the issuance of the 2029 Convertible 144A Notes, after deducting fees and estimated offering expenses. The Company used approximately 50.0 million of the net proceeds to repurchase shares of our Common Stock from purchasers of the 2029 Convertible 144A Notes in privately negotiated transactions at a purchase price equal to the closing sale price per share of Common Stock on January 4, 2024, which was 0.9067. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 2029 Convertible 144A Notes, the Company entered into separate, privately negotiated transactions with certain holders of the Company s outstanding 4.50 Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 to repurchase, on the closing date, approximately 144.4 million aggregate principal amount of such notes. The Company effected such repurchases for cash, using 146.3 million of the net proceeds from the offering of the 2029 Convertible 144A Notes, following which only 170 thousand aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes remained outstanding. 
 
 Additionally, the Company issued and sold approximately 71.1 million aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Convertible Affiliate Notes pursuant to the terms of the Affiliate Note Purchase Agreement by and among the Company and the Affiliate Purchasers. Pursuant to the Affiliate Note Purchase Agreement, the Company issued and sold the 2029 Convertible Affiliate Notes to the Affiliate Purchasers in exchange for 55.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2023 Convertible Notes, held by the Affiliate Purchasers, together with approximately 16.1 million of accrued but unpaid interest thereon. Following such exchange, no 2023 Convertible Notes remained outstanding. 
 
 Holders may convert their 2029 Convertible Notes at their option prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding September 15, 2028 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on March 31, 2024 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our Common Stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130 of the applicable conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five consecutive business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period (the convertible note measurement period in which the trading price per 1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the convertible note measurement period was less than 98 of the product of the last reported sale price of our Common Stock and the applicable conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events specified in the indenture governing the 2029 Convertible Notes. On or after September 15, 2028 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing conditions. Upon conversion of a note, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our Common Stock or a combination of cash and shares of our Common Stock, at our election. 
 
 The conversion rate is initially equal to 869.5652 shares of Common Stock per 1,000 principal amount of notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately 1.15 per share of Common Stock). The conversion rate for the 2029 Convertible Notes is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. 
 
 On March 8, 2023, ModeX, the Company (with respect to certain sections), and Merck entered into the Merck Agreement pursuant to which Merck obtained a license to certain patent rights and know-how in connection with the development of ModeX s preclinical nanoparticle vaccine candidate targeting the Epstein -Barr Virus.

Table of Contents 

ModeX and Merck have established a strategic collaboration with a detailed research plan to guide the development of such a vaccine or related product. This plan includes the creation of a joint steering committee and the potential use of third-party contract development and manufacturing organization carry out such activities unless otherwise agreed. Merck will reimburse ModeX for development costs incurred as part of this research plan. To date, we have incurred 24.5 million of development costs related to the Epstein -Barr Virus, for which Merck has provided reimbursement in full. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the total commitments under our lines of credit with financial institutions in Chile and Spain were 30.0 million, of which 11.7 million was drawn as of September 30, 2024. On September 30, 2024, the weighted average interest rate on these lines of credit was approximately 5.4 . These lines of credit are short-term and are used primarily as a source of working capital. The highest aggregate principal balance at any time outstanding during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 23.6 million. We intend to continue to draw under these lines of credit as needed. There is no assurance that these lines of credit or other funding sources will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, in the future. 
 
 Separately, on September 16, 2024, BioReference fully repaid its obligations and terminated the Credit Agreement as amended and restated. BioReference paid approximately 9.7 million to settle its obligations, incurring no prepayment premium or penalty. 
 
 In connection with our agreements with Merck, Pfizer, VFMCRP, Nicoya and CAMP4, we are eligible to receive various milestone payments and royalty considerations. Under the terms of the Merck Agreement, we received an initial payment of 50.0 million and are also eligible to receive up to an additional 872.5 million upon the achievement of certain commercial and development milestones under several indications. We are also eligible to receive tiered royalty payments ranging from high single digits to low double digits upon achievement of certain sales targets of the Product (as defined in the Merck Agreement). Under the terms of the Restated Pfizer Agreement, we have received or are eligible to receive up to an additional 275.0 million upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones, including 90 million triggered by the FDA approval in the United States and 85 million due to the commencement of sales of NGENLA (Somatrogon) in Europe and Japan, which we received in 2022. In addition, we are eligible to receive regional, tiered gross profit sharing for both Somatrogon (hGH-CTP) and Pfizer s Genotropin . Under the terms of the VFMCRP Agreement, we are entitled to receive up to an additional 15 million in regulatory milestones and 200 million in milestone payments tied to the launch, pricing and sales of Rayaldee , including a 7 million regulatory milestone payment we recorded in the first quarter of 2023 triggered by the German price approval for Rayaldee and 3 million regulatory milestone payment we recognized in 2022 following the first sale of Rayaldee in Europe. In addition, we are eligible to receive tiered, double-digit royalty payments. Under the terms of the Nicoya Agreement, we received an initial upfront payment of 5 million and are eligible to receive an aggregate of 5 million tied to the first anniversary of the effective date of the Nicoya Agreement, of which we have received 2.5 million. Furthermore, we received the additional 2.5 million upon Nicoya s submission of the investigational new drug application to the Center for Drug Evaluation of China in March 2023. We are also eligible to receive up to an additional aggregate amount of 115 million upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and sales-based milestones by Nicoya for the Nicoya Product in the Nicoya Territory. We are also eligible to receive tiered, double digit royalty payments at rates in the low double digits on net product sales within the Nicoya Territory and in the Nicoya Field. Under the terms of the CAMP4 Agreement, we received an initial upfront payment of 1.5 million. 
 
 We believe that the cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash on hand at September 30, 2024, which includes the amounts received from the sale of the 2044 Notes and the BioReference Transaction, are sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for operations and debt service beyond the next 12 months. We based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong or are subject to change, and we may be required to use our available cash resources sooner than we currently expect. If we acquire additional assets or companies, accelerate our product development programs or initiate additional clinical trials, we will need additional funds. Our future cash requirements, and the timing of those requirements, will depend on a number of factors, including the approval and success of our products and products in development, particularly our long acting Somatrogon (hGH-CTP) for which we have received approval in over 50 markets, including the United States, Europe, Japan, Australia and Canada, the commercial success of Rayaldee , BioReference s financial performance, possible acquisitions and dispositions, the continued progress of research and development of our product candidates, the timing and outcome of clinical trials and regulatory approvals, the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending, and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights, the status of competitive products, the availability of financing, our success in developing markets for our product candidates and results of government investigations, payor claims, existing legal proceedings (including the ITA litigation) and those that may arise in the future. We have historically not generated sustained positive cash flow and if we are not able to secure additional funding when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our clinical trials or research and development programs or possible acquisitions or reduce our marketing or sales efforts or cease operations.

Contractual obligations in connection with clinical trials, which span over two years, and that depend on patient enrollment. The total amount of expenditures is dependent on the actual number of patients enrolled and as such, the contracts do not specify the maximum amount we may owe. 

Product license agreements effective during the lesser of 15 years or patent expiration whereby payments and amounts are determined by applying a royalty rate on uncapped future sales. 

Contingent consideration that includes payments upon achievement of certain milestones including meeting development milestones such as the completion of successful clinical trials, NDA approvals by the FDA and revenue milestones upon the achievement of certain revenue targets all of which are anticipated to be paid within the next seven years and are payable in either shares of our Common Stock or cash, at our option, and that may aggregate up to 125.0 million. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 
 There were no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates described in our Form 10-K that have had a material impact on our Quarterly Financials and related notes. 
 
 RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
 
 Accounting standards yet to be adopted. 
 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ASU 2023-09 ), which modifies the rules on income tax disclosures to require entities to disclose (i) specific categories in the rate reconciliation, (ii) the income or loss from continuing operations before income tax expense or benefit (separated between domestic and foreign) and (iii) income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations (separated by federal, state and foreign). ASU 2023-09 also requires entities to disclose their income tax payments to international, federal, state, and local jurisdictions, among other changes. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. ASU 2023-09 should be applied on a prospective basis, but retrospective application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this new guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

Table of Contents 

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures ASU 2023-07 ). ASU 2023-07 enhances disclosures for significant segment expenses for all public entities required to report segment information in accordance with ASC 280. ASC 280 requires a public entity to report for each reportable segment a measure of segment profit or loss that its chief operating decision maker CODM uses to assess segment performance and to make decisions about resource allocations. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 with updates to be applied on a prospective basis with the option to apply the standard retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this new guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

Recently adopted accounting standards .

In 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD established an inclusive framework on base erosion and profit shifting and agreed on a two-pillar solution Pillar Two to global taxation, focusing on global profit allocation and a 15 global minimum effective tax rate. On December 15, 2022, the EU member states agreed to implement the OECD s global minimum tax rate of 15 . The OECD issued Pillar Two model rules and continues to release guidance on these rules. The inclusive framework calls for tax law changes by participating countries to take effect in 2024 and 2025. Various countries have enacted or have announced plans to enact new tax laws to implement the global minimum tax. We considered the applicable tax law changes on Pillar Two implementation in the relevant countries, and there is no material impact to our tax results for the period. We anticipate further legislative activity and administrative guidance in 2024, and will continue to evaluate the impacts of enacted legislation and pending legislation to enact Pillar Two Model Rules in the non-US tax jurisdictions we operate in.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 In the normal course of doing business, we are exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. 
 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We operate globally, and we are subject to foreign exchange risk in our commercial operations as portions of our revenues are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily those for the Chilean Peso and the Euro. 
 
 From time to time, we manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts. Certain firmly committed transactions may be hedged with foreign exchange forward contracts. As exchange rates fluctuate, gains and losses on the exposed transactions are partially offset by gains and losses related to the hedging contracts. Both the exposed transactions and the hedging contracts are translated and fair valued, respectively, at current spot rates, with gains and losses included in earnings. We do not enter into foreign exchange or other derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes. 
 
 Our derivative activities, which consist of foreign exchange forward contracts, are intended to economically hedge forecasted cash flows that are exposed to foreign currency risk. The foreign exchange forward contracts generally require us to exchange local currencies for foreign currencies based on pre-established exchange rates at the contracts respective maturity dates. As exchange rates change, gains and losses on these contracts are generated based on the change in the exchange rates that are recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and offset the impact of the change in exchange rates on the foreign currency cash flows that are hedged. If the counterparties to the exchange contracts do not fulfill their obligations to deliver the contracted currencies, our results of operations could be negatively impacted due to effectively unhedged currency related fluctuations. Our foreign exchange forward contracts primarily hedge exchange rates on the Chilean Peso to the U.S. dollar. If Chilean Pesos were to strengthen or weaken in relation to the U.S. dollar, our loss or gain on hedged foreign currency cash-flows would be offset by the derivative contracts, with a net effect of zero.

Table of Contents 

Approximately 22.3 of our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar (USD). This compares to 30.7 for the same period in 2023. Our financial statements are reported in USD; therefore, fluctuations in exchange rates affect the translation of foreign-denominated revenue and expenses. In the first nine months of 2024 and for the year ended December 31, 2023, our most significant currency exchange rate exposures were to the Euro and the Chilean Peso. Gross accumulated currency translation adjustments, recorded as a separate component of shareholders equity, totaled 36.2 million and 34.6 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. For information on such open foreign exchange forward contracts for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 see Management s Discussion and Analysis Results of Operations Foreign Currency Exchange Rates. 
 
 We do not engage in trading market risk sensitive instruments or purchasing hedging instruments or other than trading instruments that are likely to expose us to significant market risk, whether interest rate, foreign currency exchange, commodity price, or equity price risk. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to interest rate risk relates to our cash and investments and to our borrowings. We generally maintain an investment portfolio of money market funds and marketable securities. The securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged and are subject to minimal interest rate risk due to their very short-term nature. We currently do not hedge interest rate exposure. Because of the short-term maturities of our investments, we do not believe that a change in interest rates would have a significant negative impact on the value of our investment portfolio except for reduced income resulting from declining interest rates. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of 420.1 million. The weighted average interest rate related to our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 3.1 . As of September 30, 2024, the principal outstanding balances under our Chilean and Spanish lines of credit was 11.7 million in the aggregate at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.4 . 
 
 Our outstanding convertible senior notes have fixed rates of interest; therefore, we are not exposed to interest rate risk on those instruments. 
 
 The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk. To achieve this objective, we may invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the U.S. Government and its agencies, bank obligations, repurchase agreements and high-quality corporate issuers, and money market funds that invest in such debt instruments, and, by policy, restrict our exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing concentration limits. To minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates, we maintain investments at an average maturity of generally less than three months. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on management s evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024.

 There have been no changes to the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
