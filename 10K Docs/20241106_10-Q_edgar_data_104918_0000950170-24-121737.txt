 Forward-Looki ng Statements 
 From time to time, we make forward-looking statements such as statements regarding projected or future: 
 financial performance; 

cash flows; 

capital expenditures; 

dividends; 

capital structure; 

other financial items; 

strategic goals and objectives; 

business environment; and 

plans for operations. 

These statements are based upon underlying assumptions (many of which are based, in turn, upon further assumptions). Such statements are made both in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (including this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q), and elsewhere. Forward-looking statements are all statements except those of historical fact including, without limitation, those identified by the use of words that include will, may, could, should, intends, plans, seeks, anticipates, estimates, expects, forecasts, projects, predicts, and similar expressions. 
 Forward-looking statements (including those made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q) are subject to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Most of these factors are beyond our control and may have a significant effect on our operations, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in our statements. Such risks, uncertainties and other factors include, among others: 
 Utility Regulatory Risk 
 state and federal regulatory decisions or related judicial decisions that affect our ability to recover costs and earn a reasonable return including, but not limited to, disallowance or delay in the recovery of capital investments, operating costs, commodity costs, the ordering of refunds to customers and discretion over allowed return on investment; 

the loss of regulatory accounting treatment, which could require the write-off of regulatory assets and the loss of regulatory deferral and recovery mechanisms; 

Operational Risk 
 weather conditions, which affect both energy demand and electric generating capability, including the impact of precipitation and temperature on hydroelectric resources, the impact of wind patterns on wind-generated power, weather-sensitive customer demand, and similar impacts on supply and demand in the wholesale energy markets; 

wildfires ignited, or allegedly ignited, by our equipment or facilities could cause significant loss of life and property or result in liability for resulting fire suppression costs and/or damages, thereby causing serious operational, reputational and financial harm; 

severe weather or natural disasters, including, but not limited to, avalanches, wind storms, wildfires, earthquakes, extreme temperature events, snow and ice storms that could disrupt energy generation, transmission and distribution, as well as the availability and costs of fuel, materials, equipment, supplies and support services; 

political unrest and/or conflicts between foreign nation-states, which could disrupt the global, national and local economy, result in increases in operating and capital costs, impact energy commodity prices or our ability to access energy resources, create disruption in supply chains, disrupt, weaken or create volatility in capital markets, and increase cyber

 and physical security risks. In addition, any of these factors could negatively impact our liquidity and limit our access to capital, among other implications; 

explosions, fires, accidents, mechanical breakdowns or other incidents that could impair assets and may disrupt operations of our generation facilities, transmission, and electric and natural gas distribution systems or other operations and may require us to purchase replacement power or incur costs to repair our facilities; 

interruptions in the delivery of natural gas by our suppliers, including physical problems with pipelines themselves, can disrupt our service of natural gas to our customers and/or impair our ability to operate gas-fired electric generating facilities; 

explosions, fires, accidents or other incidents arising from or allegedly arising from our operations that could cause injuries to the public or property damage; 

blackouts or disruptions of interconnected transmission systems (the regional power grid); 

terrorist attacks, cyberattacks or other malicious acts that could disrupt or cause damage to our utility assets or to the national or regional economy in general, including effects of terrorism, cyberattacks, ransomware, or vandalism that damage or disrupt information technology systems; 

pandemics, which could disrupt our business, as well as the global, national and local economy, resulting in a decline in customer demand, deterioration in the creditworthiness of our customers, increases in operating and capital costs, workforce shortages, losses or disruptions in our workforce due to vaccine mandates, delays in capital projects, disruption in supply chains, and disruption, weakness and volatility in capital markets. In addition, any of these factors could negatively impact our liquidity and limit our access to capital, among other implications; 

work-force issues, including changes in collective bargaining unit agreements, strikes, work stoppages, the loss of key executives, availability of workers in a variety of skill areas, and our ability to recruit and retain employees; 

changes in the availability and price of purchased power, fuel and natural gas, as well as transmission capacity; 

increasing costs of insurance, more restrictive coverage terms and our ability to obtain insurance; 

delays or changes in construction costs, and/or our ability to obtain required permits and materials for present or prospective facilities; 

increasing health care costs and cost of health insurance provided to our employees and retirees; 

increasing operating costs, including effects of inflationary pressures; 

third party construction of buildings, billboard signs, towers or other structures within our rights of way, or placement of fuel containers within close proximity to our transformers or other equipment, including overbuilding atop natural gas distribution lines; 

the loss of key suppliers for materials or services or other disruptions to the supply chain; 

adverse impacts to our Alaska electric utility (AEL P) that could result from an extended outage of its hydroelectric generating resources or their inability to deliver energy, due to their lack of interconnectivity to other electrical grids and the availability or cost of replacement power (diesel); 

changing river or reservoir regulation or operations at hydroelectric facilities not owned by us, which could impact our hydroelectric facilities downstream; 

2 

Table of Contents AVISTA CORPORATION 

 Climate Change Risk 
 increasing frequency and intensity of severe weather or natural disasters resulting from climate change, that could disrupt energy generation, transmission and distribution, as well as the availability and costs of fuel, materials, equipment, supplies and support services;

changes in the use, perception, or regulation of generative artificial intelligence technologies, which could limit our ability to utilize such technology, create risk of enhanced regulatory scrutiny, generate uncertainty around intellectual property ownership, licensing or use, or which could otherwise result in risk of damage to our business, reputation or financial results; 

changes in costs that impede our ability to implement new information technology systems or to operate and maintain current production technology; 

insufficient technology skills, which could lead to the inability to develop, modify or maintain our information systems; 

Strategic Risk 
 growth or decline of our customer base due to new uses for our services or decline in existing services, including, but not limited to, the effect of the trend toward distributed generation at customer sites; 

the potential effects of negative publicity regarding our business practices, whether true or not, which could hurt our reputation and result in litigation or a decline in our common stock price; 

changes in our strategic business plans, which could be affected by any or all of the foregoing, including the entry into new businesses and/or the exit from existing businesses and the extent of our business development efforts where potential future business is uncertain;

 wholesale and retail competition including alternative energy sources, growth in customer-owned power resource technologies that displace utility-supplied energy or may be sold back to the utility, and alternative energy suppliers and delivery arrangements; 

non-regulated activities may increase earnings volatility and result in investment losses; 

the risk of municipalization or other forms of service territory reduction; 

External Mandates Risk 
 changes in environmental laws, regulations, decisions and policies, including, but not limited to, regulatory responses to concerns regarding climate change, efforts to restore anadromous fish in areas currently blocked by dams, more stringent requirements related to air quality, water quality and waste management, present and potential environmental remediation costs and our compliance with these matters; 

the potential effects of initiatives, legislation or administrative rulemaking at the federal, state or local levels, including possible effects on our generating resources, prohibitions or restrictions on new or existing services, or restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate concerns over climate changes, including future limitations on the usage and distribution of natural gas; 

political pressures or regulatory practices that could constrain or place additional cost burdens on our distribution systems through accelerated adoption of distributed generation or electric-powered transportation or on our energy supply sources, such as campaigns to halt fossil fuel-fired power generation and opposition to other thermal generation, wind turbines or hydroelectric facilities; 

failure to identify changes in legislation, taxation and regulatory issues that could be detrimental or beneficial to our overall business; 

policy and/or legislative changes in various regulated areas, including, but not limited to, environmental regulation, healthcare regulations and import/export regulations; 

Financial Risk 
 our ability to obtain financing through the issuance of debt and/or equity securities and access to our funds held with financial institutions, which could be affected by various factors including our credit ratings, interest rates, other capital market conditions and global economic conditions; 

changes in interest rates that affect borrowing costs, variable interest rate borrowing and the extent to which we recover interest costs through retail rates collected from customers; 

volatility in energy commodity markets that affect our ability to effectively hedge energy commodity risks, including cash flow impacts and requirements for collateral; 

volatility in the carbon emissions allowances market that could result in increased compliance costs; 

changes in actuarial assumptions, interest rates and the actual return on plan assets for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans, which could affect future funding obligations, pension and other postretirement benefit expense and the related liabilities; 

the outcome of legal proceedings and other contingencies;

the ability to comply with the terms of the licenses and permits for our hydroelectric or thermal generating facilities at cost-effective levels. 

Our expectations, beliefs and projections are expressed in good faith. We believe they are reasonable based on, without limitation, an examination of historical operating trends, our records and other information available from third parties. There can be no assurance our expectations, beliefs or projections will be achieved or accomplished. Furthermore, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement or statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. New risks, uncertainties and other factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all such factors, nor can we assess the effect of each such factor on our business or the extent any such factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.

 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED F INANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 
 The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of Avista Corp. as of and for the interim periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 are unaudited; however, in the opinion of management, the statements reflect all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. The Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. These condensed consolidated financial statements do not contain the detail or footnote disclosure concerning accounting policies and other matters which would be included in full fiscal year consolidated financial statements; therefore, they should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (2023 Form 10-K).

Significant Judgments and Unsatisfied Performance Obligations The only significant judgments involving revenue recognition are estimates surrounding unbilled revenue and receivables from contracts with customers and estimates surrounding the amount of decoupling revenues that will be collected from customers within 24 months (discussed above). The Company has certain capacity arrangements, where the Company has a contractual obligation to provide either electric or natural gas capacity to its customers for a fixed fee. Most of these arrangements are paid for in arrears by the customers and do not result in deferred revenue and only result in receivables from the customers. The Company has one capacity agreement where the customer makes payments throughout the year. As of September 30, 2024, the Company estimates it had unsatisfied capacity performance obligations of million , which will be recognized as revenue in future periods as the capacity is provided to the customers. These performance obligations are not reflected in the financial statements, as the Company has not received payment for these services.

2026 

As of December 31, 2023 , there were expected deliveries of energy commodity derivatives after 2 26. (1) Physical transactions represent commodity transactions in which Avista Corp. will take or make delivery of either electricity or natural gas; financial transactions represent derivative instruments with delivery of cash in the amount of the benefit or cost but with no physical delivery of the commodity, such as futures, swap derivatives, options, or forward contracts. 

The electric and natural gas derivative contracts above will be included in either power supply costs or natural gas supply costs during the period they are scheduled to be delivered and will be included in the various deferral and recovery mechanisms (ERM, PCA and PGAs), or in the general rate case process, and are expected to be recovered through retail rates from customers. Foreign Currency Exchange Derivatives A significant portion of Avista Corp. s natural gas supply (including fuel for power generation) is obtained from Canadian sources. Most of those transactions are executed in U.S. dollars, which avoids foreign currency risk. A portion of Avista Corp. s short-term natural gas transactions and long-term Canadian transportation contracts are committed based on Canadian currency prices. The short-term natural gas transactions are settled within days with U.S. dollars. Avista Corp. hedges a portion of the foreign currency risk by purchasing Canadian currency exchange derivatives when such commodity transactions are initiated. The foreign currency exchange derivatives and the unhedged foreign currency risk have not had a material effect on Avista Corp. s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows and these differences in cost related to currency fluctuations are included with natural gas supply costs for ratemaking.

Exposure to Demands for Collateral Avista Corp.'s derivative contracts often require collateral (in the form of cash or letters of credit) or other credit enhancements, or reductions or terminations of a portion of the contract through cash settlement. In the event of changes in market prices or a downgrade in Avista Corp.'s credit ratings or other established credit criteria, additional collateral may be required. In periods of price volatility, the level of exposure can change significantly. As a result, sudden and significant demands may be made against Avista Corp.'s credit facilities and cash. Avista Corp. actively monitors the exposure to possible collateral calls and takes steps to mitigate capital requirements. 

Letters of credit outstanding 

letters of credit were outstanding, and cash collateral was on deposit, related to interest rate swap derivatives a s of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Certain of Avista Corp. s derivative instruments contain provisions that require Avista Corp. to maintain an "investment grade" credit rating from the major credit rating agencies. If Avista Corp. s credit ratings were to fall below "investment grade," it would be in violation of these provisions, and the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request immediate payment or demand immediate and ongoing collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions. The following table presents the aggregate fair value of energy commodity derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features in a liability position and the amount of additional collateral Avista Corp. could be required to post as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands):

Total service costs in the table above are recorded to the same accounts as labor expense. Labor and benefits expense is recorded to various projects based on whether the work is a capital project or an operating expense. Approximately percent of all labor and benefits is capitalized to utility property and percent is expensed to utility other operating expenses. The non-service portion of costs in the table above are recorded to other expense below income from operations in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income or capitalized as a regulatory asset. Approximately percent of the costs are capitalized to regulatory assets and percent is expensed to the income statement. In 2024, the Company offered pension participants an election to leave the pension plan for an alternative defined contribution 401(k) plan. In April 2024, it was determined that due to the number of participants electing to leave the pension plan, as well as the resulting decrease in expected future service, this event resulted in a curtailment of the pension plan, and an associated gain of million for the reduction in the benefit obligation. This gain was of fset against the unrecognized net actuarial loss (and recorded within a regulatory asset). There was also a million loss recognized for the acceleration of unrecognized prior service costs. The curtailment triggered a remeasurement of pension plan. The impact of the remeasurement was not material to the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements.

Avista Corp. had million and million in letters of credit outstanding under this agreement as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Letters of credit are not reflected on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. If a letter of credit were drawn upon by the holder, Avista Corp. would have an immediate obligation to reimburse the bank that issued the letter of credit. Covenants and Default Provisions The short-term borrowing agreements contain customary covenants and default provisions, including a change in control (as defined in the agreements). The events of default under each of the credit facilities also include a cross default from other indebtedness (as defined) and, in the case of the letter of credit agreement, other obligations. The committed line of credit agreement also includes a covenant which does not permit the ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated total capitalization of Avista Corp. to be greater than percent at any time. As of September 30, 2024, the Company complied with this covenant. AEL P AEL P has a committed line of credit in the amount of million that expires in . There was million outstanding under this agreement as of September 30, 2024 with an average interest rate of percent, and balance outstanding as of December 31, 2023.

The committed line of credit agreement contains customary covenants and default provisions. The credit agreement has a covenant which does not permit the ratio of "consolidated total debt at AEL P" to "consolidated total capitalization at AEL P," including the impact of the Snettisham bonds to be greater than percent at any time. As of September 30, 2024 , AEL P complied with this covenant. 

 million and million of the City of Forsyth, Montana Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds due in 2032 and 2034, respectively. The bonds are not subject to ordinary optional redemption. The bonds are secured by equal principal amounts of non-transferable first mortgage bonds of the Company. The interest rate on both series of bonds is percent. Avista Corp. purchased the Forsyth bonds upon original issuance in December 2010, with the intention to hold the bonds until market conditions were favorable for remarketing the bonds to unaffiliated investors. While the Company was the holder of these bonds, the bonds were not reflected as an asset or a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon the remarketing of these bonds, the Company recognized long term debt of million. In connection with the pricing of the Forsyth bonds in March 2024, the Company cash-settled interest rate swap derivatives (notional aggregate amount of million) and received a net amount of million, which will be amortized as a component of interest expense over the life of the bonds. See Note 5 for a discussion of interest rate swap derivatives. The net proceeds from the remarketing of the Forsyth bonds were used to repay a portion of the borrowings outstanding under the Company's committed line of credit. 

 , the Company issued Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures, Series B, with a principal amount of million to Avista Capital II, an affiliated business trust formed by the Company.

Concurrent with the issuance of the Preferred Trust Securities, Avista Capital II issued million of Common Trust Securities to the Company. The Preferred Trust Securities may be redeemed at the option of Avista Capital II at any time and mature on June 1, 2037. In December 2000, the Company purchased million of these Preferred Trust Securities. The Company owns percent of Avista Capital II and has solely and unconditionally guaranteed the payment of distributions on, and redemption price and liquidation amount for, the Preferred Trust Securities to the extent Avista Capital II has funds available for such payments from the respective debt securities. Upon maturity or prior redemption of such debt securities, the Preferred Trust Securities will be mandatorily redeemed. The Company does not include these capital trusts in its condensed consolidated financial statements as Avista Corp. is not the primary beneficiary. As such, the sole assets of the capital trusts are million of junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures of Avista Corp., which are reflected on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Interest expense to affiliated trusts in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income represents interest expense on these debentures.

Long-term debt (Level 3) 

Snettisham finance lease obligation (Level 3) 

Long-term debt to affiliated trusts (Level 3) 

These estimates of fair value of long-term debt and long-term debt to affiliated trusts were primarily based on available market information, which generally consists of estimated market prices from third party brokers for debt with similar risk and terms. The price ranges obtained from the third party brokers consisted of market prices of percent to percent of the principal amount, where percent of the principal amount (adjusted for unamortized discount or premium) represents the carrying value recorded on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Level 2 long-term debt represents publicly issued bonds with quoted market prices; however, due to their limited trading activity, they are classified as Level 2 because brokers must generate quotes and make estimates if there is no trading activity near a period end. Level 3 long-term debt consists of private placement bonds and debt to affiliated trusts, which typically have no secondary trading activity. Fair values in Level 3 are estimated based on market prices from third party brokers using secondary market quotes for debt with similar risk and terms to generate quotes for Avista Corp. bonds. Due to the unique nature of the Snettisham finance lease obligation, the estimated fair value of these items was determined based on a discounted cash flow model using available market information. The Snettisham finance lease obligation fair value is determined using the Morgan Markets A Ex-Fin discount rate as published on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

The difference between the amount of derivative assets and liabilities disclosed in respective levels in the table above and the amount of derivative assets and liabilities disclosed on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets is due to netting arrangements with certain counterparties. See Note 5 for additional discussion of derivative netting. To establish fair value for energy commodity derivatives, the Company uses quoted market prices and forward price curves to estimate the fair value of energy commodity derivative instruments included in Level 2. Electric derivative valuations are performed using market quotes, adjusted for periods in between quotable periods. Natural gas derivative valuations are estimated using New York Mercantile Exchange pricing for similar instruments, adjusted for basin differences, using market quotes. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the contract, the derivative asset or liability is included in Level 2.

The valuation methods, significant inputs and resulting fair values described above were developed by the Company and are reviewed on at least a quarterly basis to ensure they provide a reasonable estimate of fair value each reporting period. Equity Investments The Company has equity investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis. For one investment, fair value is determined using a market approach, starting with enterprise values from recent market transaction data for comparable companies with similar equity instruments. The market transaction data was used to estimate an enterprise value of the underlying investment and that value was allocated to the various classes of equity via an option pricing model and a waterfall approach. The selection of appropriate comparable companies and the expected time to a liquidation event requires management judgment. The significant assumptions in the analysis include the comparable market transactions and related enterprise values, time to liquidity event and the market discount for lack of liquidity. In the event there are relevant market transactions for the same or similar securities of the subject company or there is the reasonable possibility of a transaction occurring, those transactions are utilized as an input to the valuation with a probability weight applied to the valuation. For the second investment, the fair value is determined using an income approach utilizing a discounted cash flow model. The model is based on income statement forecasts from the underlying company to determine cash flows for the period of ownership. The model then utilizes market multiples from publicly traded comparable companies in similar industries and projects to estimate the terminal

On October 31, 2024, Ecology agreed to stay the AEL issued in September 2024 for a period of days to allow the Company to revise its emissions report (see above) and receive a positive verification statement from the third-party verifier. Under Washington law and as provided in an agreement with the Company entered into on October 31, 2024, Ecology has the authority and will adjust the AEL upon receipt of a report with a positive verification statement. Avista Corp. expects to receive a positive verification statement and for Ecology to adjust the AEL in the fourth quarter of 2024. If Avista Corp. doe s not receive a positive verification statement or if, despite the express agreement between Ecology and the Company, Ecology does not adjust the AEL, Avista Corp. estimates the additional liability could be up to million, of which million would be allocated to Idaho and million allocated to Washington. The Company does not believe such an outcome is probable and the Company would exercise all available legal and administrative remedies to preserve its rights under the law. Collective Bargaining Agreements The Company's collective bargaining agreement with the IBEW represents percent of all Avista Utilities' employees. The Company's largest represented group, representing approximately percent of Avista Utilities' bargaining unit employees in Washington and Idaho, are covered under a agreement which expires in . The current agreement includes a clause to negotiate wages in effect for the last year of the agreement. On July 31, 2024, the IBEW voted to approve new wages for 2024 and 2025, with wages for 2024 effective retroactively to March 26, 2024 and wages for 2025 taking effect on January 1, 2025. Boyds Fire (State of Washington Department of Natural Resources v. Avista) In August 2019, the Company was served with a complaint, captioned State of Washington Department of Natural Resources v. Avista Corporation, seeking recovery of up to million for fire suppression and investigation costs and related expenses incurred in connection with a wildfire that occurred in Ferry County, Washington, in August 2018. Specifically, the complaint alleges the fire, which became known as the Boyds Fire, was caused by a dead ponderosa pine tree falling into an overhead distribution line, and that Avista Corp., along with its independent vegetation management contractors Asplundh Tree Company and CN Utility Consulting, were negligent in failing to identify and remove the tree before it came into contact with the line. Avista Corp. disputes that it was negligent in failing to identify and remove the tree in question. Additional lawsuits were subsequently filed by private landowners seeking million in property damages as well as potential non-economic damages, and holders of insurance subrogation claims seeking recovery of million in insurance proceeds purportedly paid to their insureds.

 million in connection with a fire that occurred in Douglas County, Washington, in July 2020. In June 2022, those claimants filed suit in the Superior Court of Douglas County, Washington, seeking unspecified damages. The fire, which was designated as the Road 11 Fire, occurred in the vicinity of an Avista Corp. 115kv line, resulting in damage to three overhead transmission structures. The fire occurred during a high wind event and grew to acres before being contained. In June 2024, the parties reached an agreement to settle the matter for million which will result in dismissal of the lawsuit with prejudice. Labor Day 2020 Windstorm/ Babb Road Fire In September 2020, a severe windstorm occurred in eastern Washington and northern Idaho. The extreme weather event resulted in customer outages and multiple wildfires in the region, including the Babb Road Fire, which occurred near the town of Malden, Washington. The Babb Road Fire covered approximately acres and destroyed approximately structures. There are no reports of personal injury or death resulting from the fire. In May 2021 the Company learned the Washington Department of Natural Resources (DNR) had completed its investigation and issued a report on the Babb Road Fire. The DNR report concluded, among other things, that the fire was ignited when a branch of a multi-dominant Ponderosa Pine tree was broken off by the wind and fell on an Avista Corp. distribution line; 

 the tree was located approximately 30 feet from the center of Avista Corp. s distribution line and approximately 20 feet beyond Avista Corp. s right-of-way; 

 the tree showed some evidence of insect damage, a small area of scarring where a lateral branch/leader (LBL) had broken off in the past, and some past signs of Gall Rust disease. 

 The DNR report concluded that: because of the unusual configuration of the tree, and its proximity to the powerline, a closer inspection was warranted. A nearer inspection of the tree should have revealed the cut LBL ends and its previous failure, and necessitated determination of the failure potential of the adjacent LBL, implicated in starting the Babb Road Fire. The DNR report acknowledged that, other than the multi-dominant nature of the tree, the conditions mentioned above would not have been easily visible without close-up inspection of, or cutting into, the tree. The report also acknowledged that, while the presence of multiple tops would have been visible from the nearby roadway, the tree did not fail at a v-fork due to the presence of multiple tops. The Company contends that applicable inspection standards did not require a closer inspection of the otherwise healthy tree, nor was the Company negligent with respect to its maintenance, inspection or vegetation management practices. Eleven lawsuits have been filed in connection with the Babb Road fire. Asplundh Tree Company and CN Utility Consulting, which both perform vegetation management services as independent contractors to the Company, are also named as defendants in each of the lawsuits. The lawsuits include subrogation actions filed by 51 insurance companies seeking to recover approximately million purportedly paid to insureds to date; and actions on behalf of individual plaintiffs seeking unspecified damages, of which was originally filed as a class action lawsuit on behalf of three putative individual plaintiffs, but which has since been amended to assert direct claims on behalf of the named plaintiffs. In the course of discovery, individual plaintiffs have provided economic damage estimates, claiming total economic losses of approximately million, of which approximately million is covered by insurance or other forms of reimbursement. These plaintiffs may also seek as-yet unspecified non-economic damages (pain and suffering and emotional distress). The Company does not believe non-economic damages are applicable in this case and plans to dispute such claims.

 acres and seven primary residences , as well as several outbuildings. The Idaho Department of Lands investigated and has issued a report in which it concluded the fire was caused by an electrical fault igniting three separate spots which then spread uphill. The Company has a distribution line in the area near the ignition point. The Company has to date found no evidence suggesting negligence on its part. Except for two claims for damage to personal property, the Company has not, at this time, received any claims in connection with the fire. The Company will vigorously defend itself in the event any such claims are asserted; however, at this time, it is unable to estimate the likelihood of an adverse outcome nor the amount or range of a potential loss in the event of an adverse outcome.

 Agreement Between Avista and NorthWestern In January 2023, the Company entered into an agreement with NorthWestern under which, subject to the terms and conditions specified in the agreement, the Company will transfer its percent ownership in Colstrip Units 3 and 4 to NorthWestern. There is no monetary exchange included in the transaction. The transaction is scheduled to close on December 31, 2025 or such other date as the parties mutually agree upon. Under the agreement, the Company will remain obligated through the close of the transaction to pay its share of (i) operating expenses, (ii) capital expenditures, but not in excess of the portion allocable pro rata to the portion of useful life (through 2030) expired through the close of the transaction, and (iii) site remediation expenses except certain costs relating to post closing activities. In addition, the Company would enter into an agreement under which it would retain its voting rights with respect to decisions relating to remediation. The Company will retain its Colstrip transmission system assets, which are excluded from the transaction. The transaction is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions including NorthWestern's ability to enter into a new coal supply agreement by December 31, 2024. The Company does not expect this transaction to have a direct material impact on its financial results. Agreement Between PSE and NorthWestern In July 2024, PSE entered into an agreement with NorthWestern under which, PSE will transfer its percent ownership in Colstrip Units 3 and 4 to NorthWestern. There is no monetary exchange included in the transaction. The transaction is scheduled to close on December 31, 2025. Burnett et al. v. Talen et al. Multiple property owners initiated a legal proceeding (titled Burnett et al. v. Talen et al. in the Montana District Court for Rosebud County against Talen, PSE, PacifiCorp, PGE, Avista Corp., NorthWestern, and Westmoreland Rosebud Mining. The plaintiffs allege a failure to contain coal dust in connection with the operation of Colstrip, and seek unspecified damages. The Colstrip owners reached a settlement with one of the litigants, Richard Burnett, for an amount of less than million. The settlement does not involve or implicate the claims of any other litigants. The Company will vigorously defend itself in the litigation, but at this time is unable to predict the outcome, nor an amount or range of potential impact in the event of an outcome adverse to the Company s interests.

 million in connection with the incident for alleged damage to natural and cultural resources . In addition, the DOJ indicated that it may seek treble damages under the SURPA and state law, bringing its total potential claim to approximately million. In April 2024 the parties reached a settlement in principle, through which the Company has agreed to pay million in order to settle all claims and allegations relating to the matter. The settlement in principle is contingent upon execution of a mutually acceptable settlement agreement, as well as a required public notice and comment period to be initiated by NPS and/or the DOJ. Rathdrum, Idaho Natural Gas Incident In October 2021, there was an incident in Rathdrum, Idaho involving the Company s natural gas infrastructure. The incident occurred after a third party damaged those facilities during excavation work. The incident resulted in a fire which destroyed one residence and resulted in minor injuries to the occupants. In January 2023, the Company was served with a lawsuit filed in the District Court of Kootenai County, Idaho by one property owner, seeking unspecified damages. In February 2024, the Company received a second lawsuit filed by the owners of the adjacent property, seeking damages for personal injury and emotional distress from having witnessed the incident. The Company will vigorously defend itself in the legal proceedings; however, at this time the Company is unable to predict the likelihood of an adverse outcome or estimate a range of potential loss in the event of such an outcome. Other Contingencies In the normal course of business, the Company has various other legal claims and contingent matters outstanding. The Company believes any liability arising from these actions will not have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. It is possible a change could occur in the Company s estimates of the probability or amount of a liability being incurred. Such a change, should it occur, could be significant. See "Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" in the 2023 Form 10-K for additional discussion regarding other contingencies.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGIST ERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of 
 Avista Corporation 
 Results of Review of Interim Financial Information 
 We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet of Avista Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of September 30, 2024, the related condensed consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, and equity for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "interim financial information"). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial information for it to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 20, 2024, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. 
 Basis for Review Results 
 This interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company's management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our reviews in accordance with standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

Executive Overview 
 Overall Results 
 Net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the effects of general rate cases and tax customer credits. These increases in earnings were partially offset by expected increases in operating expenses, depreciation and amortization expense, taxes other than income tax and interest expense. 
 More detailed explanations of the fluctuations in revenues and expenses are provided in the results of operations and business segment discussions (Avista Utilities, AEL P, and the other businesses) that follow this summary. 
 Resource Adequacy 
 Peak Load Requirements 
 Extreme weather events, both in summer and winter, have recently occurred in the Pacific Northwest. These events have resulted in system load peaks that were higher than anticipated. Historically, we have had excess capacity as compared to peak load, but during some extreme events we have had to purchase short-term energy from the wholesale market to meet demand when our energy resources were not operating at full capacity or were otherwise unavailable. These weather events have highlighted the growing need for additional generating capacity both on our system and in the Pacific Northwest region. Accordingly, we are taking the increased peaks in demand into account as we consider our resource adequacy and generation requirements. 
 Annual Energy Requirements 
 The transition to clean energy (including the replacement of emitting facilities with non-emitting facilities, which are impacted by conditions outside of our control), and electrification, combined with expected load growth, factor into the analysis of the need for additional generation. As a result, we expect additional generating capacity will be needed earlier than reflected in our 2023 integrated resource plan (IRP). 
 41 

Table of Contents AVISTA CORPORATION 

 2025 IRP 
 A draft IRP, reflecting the accelerated addition of generating resources, was submitted to the WUTC and IPUC in October 2024, and we plan to file the final IRP in January 2025. While the draft 2025 IRP is, and even the final 2025 IRP will be, subject to change from time to time due to changing circumstances, assumptions and projections, given the exit of Colstrip (222 MW) from our system by December 31, 2025 and the expected retirement of the Northeast combustion turbine (64.8 MW) in 2030, we see the need for the addition of approximately 490 MW of generating capacity by 2030 and a total of approximately 950 MW through 2035. We believe the additional capacity would likely consist of primarily of wind resources and a natural gas combustion turbine. The new capacity would likely be a combination of resources owned by the Company and resources committed under PPAs, to be determined on a case-by-case basis depending upon financial, tax and regulatory considerations. 
 We also expect expanded transmission infrastructure will provide access to additional resources and improve reliability in our region. We have signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding to join the North Plains Connector transmission line project, constructing a transmission line from Bismarck, North Dakota to Colstrip, Montana. 
 2024 Hydroelectric Generation and Snowpack Conditions 
 During 2024, our region experienced low precipitation, resulting in low snowpack levels and streamflows when compared to historical averages. This had a negative impact on our hydroelectric generation resources. Lower hydroelectric generation increased net power supply costs and resulted in us absorbing additional costs under the ERM in Washington. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a 7.8 million pre-tax expense under the ERM in Washington. 
 Washington Climate Commitment Act (CCA) 
 Effective January 1, 2023, the CCA went into effect in the State of Washington, requiring us to secure carbon allowances to cover our carbon emissions over a certain amount each year. Costs associated with the CCA are being deferred and are included in Washington natural gas customer rates starting in April 2024. The resulting aggregate increase to customer bills was approximately 3.7 percent over a one year period, and impacts customers differently based on revenue class, income level, and meter connection date. We have proposed an additional customer bill increase to recover costs associated with the CCA of 9.1 percent to become effective in November 2024, subject to WUTC approval. 
 Costs associated with the CCA related to our electric operations are deferred and included in the ERM for Washington customers. Amounts allocated to Idaho are not approved for recovery from customers. See "Note 15 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements" for further discussion of the CCA costs associated with our electric operations and impacts on our financial results. 
 Regulatory Lag 
 Regulatory lag is inherent in utility ratemaking; a result of the delay between the investment in utility plant and/or the increase in costs and the receipt of an order of a public utility commission authorizing an increase in rates sufficient to recover such investment or costs. Regulatory lag can be mitigated to some extent by the incorporation of reasonably expected forward-looking information into an authorization of increased rates. However, there is no protection against unexpected inflation and increased interest rates, as experienced in 2022 and 2023. While we believe our recent general rate settlements are helpful, some increases in our costs will have to be addressed in future rate cases, including our 2024 Washington general rate cases. See Regulatory Matters for additional discussion of the general rate cases.

 Regulatory Matters 
 General Rate Cases 
 We regularly review the need for electric and natural gas rate changes in each state in which we provide service. We expect to continue to file for rate adjustments to: 
 seek recovery of operating costs and capital investments, and 

seek the opportunity to earn reasonable returns as allowed by regulators. 

With regard to the timing and plans for future filings, the assessment of our need for rate relief and the development of rate case plans takes into consideration short-term and long-term needs, as well as specific factors that can affect the timing of rate filings. Such factors include, but are not limited to, in-service dates of major capital investments and the timing of changes in major revenue and expense items. 
 Avista Utilities 
 Washington General Rate Cases 
 2024 General Rate Cases 
 On January 18, 2024, we filed multi-year electric and natural gas general rate cases with the WUTC. If approved, new rates would be effective in December 2024 and December 2025. 
 The proposed electric and natural gas revenue increase requests were based on a 10.4 percent ROE with a common equity ratio of 48.5 percent and an ROR of 7.61 percent. Increasing power supply costs, operating and maintenance costs, and ongoing capital investments (including clean energy hydroelectric projects, continued investment in the wildfire resiliency plan, replacement of natural gas distribution pipe and technology upgrades) were the main drivers of proposed increases. 
 In the second year of the proposed electric multi-year rate plan, in compliance with Washington s CETA, we have removed from customers rates the costs associated with Colstrip. 
 In August 2024, we filed rebuttal testimony, which updated our request as follows: 
 The proposed rates are designed to increase annual base electric revenues by 42.9 million, or 7.3 percent, effective in December 2024, and 44.9 million (representing our 69.3 million requested increase partially offset by a 24.4 million reduction in customer rates resulting from a revenue reduction in a separate Colstrip tariff) or 10.9 percent, effective in December 2025. 

For the December 2025 electric increase, the effect of increasing base power supply costs (primarily to make up for the removal of Colstrip from our generation portfolio) accounts for 54.2 million of our overall 69.3 million request. 

The proposed rates are designed to increase annual base natural gas revenues by 16.8 million, or 13.2 percent, effective December 2024, and 4.0 million, or 2.8 percent, effective December 2025. 

Additionally, we are proposing changes to the ERM. Under the present construct, the ERM consists of a 4 million deadband, and then an asymmetric sharing band between 4 million and 10 million. All costs above 10 million are shared on a 90 percent customer, 10 percent company basis. As part of this rate case on rebuttal, we are proposing to have a 2 million deadband in the rebate direction, a 2.5 million deadband in the surcharge direction, and all other costs shared on a 90 percent customer, 10 percent company basis. 
 The WUTC has up to eleven months to review the general rate case filings and issue a decision, which is expected in December 2024.

 Idaho General Rate Cases 
 2023 General Rate Cases 
 In February 2023, we filed multi-year electric and natural gas general rate cases with the IPUC. In August 2023, the IPUC approved the multi-party settlement agreement designed to increase annual base electric revenues by 22.1 million, or 8.0 percent, effective in September 2023, and 4.3 million, or 1.4 percent, effective in September 2024. The agreement was designed to increase annual base natural gas revenues by 1.3 million, or 2.7 percent, effective in September 2023, and a negligible increase effective in September 2024. 
 The settlement was based on an ROE of 9.4 percent, with a common equity ratio of 50 percent, and an ROR of 7.19 percent. 
 2025 General Rate Cases 
 We expect to file electric and natural gas general rate cases with the IPUC in the first quarter of 2025. 
 Oregon General Rate Case 
 2023 General Rate Case 
 In March 2023, we filed a natural gas general rate case with the OPUC. In October 2023, the OPUC approved the all-party settlement agreement filed in August 2023. The approved rates are designed to increase annual base natural gas revenues by 7.2 million, or 9.4 percent effective January 1, 2024. The OPUC approved an ROR of 7.24 percent, a common equity ratio of 50 percent, and an ROE of 9.5 percent. 
 2024 General Rate Case 
 In November 2024, we filed a general rate case with the OPUC, which is designed to increase overall revenue by 7.8 million, or 9.2 percent, effective September 1, 2025. The case is based on a proposed ROR of 7.67 percent with a common equity ratio of 50 percent and an ROE of 10.4 percent. Ongoing capital infrastructure investment (including replacement and expansion of natural gas distribution pipe and technology) is the main driver of the proposed increase. The OPUC has up to ten months to review the general rate case filing and issue a decision. 
 AEL P 
 Alaska General Rate Case 
 In August 2023, the RCA issued a final order related to AEL P s electric general rate case, which was originally filed in July 2022. 
 The order reflects an 11.45 percent ROE, a common equity ratio of 60.7 percent, and an ROR of 8.79 percent. The order also results in an approved base electric revenue increase of 6.0 percent (designed to increase annual electric revenues by 2.1 million), and also makes non-refundable the interim rate increase of 4.5 percent that was approved by the RCA in August 2022 and took effect in September 2022. The final increase to rates was effective in October 2023. 
 AEL P is required to file its next general rate case by August 2027. 
 Avista Utilities 
 Purchased Gas Adjustments 
 PGAs are designed to pass through changes in natural gas costs to customers with little to no change in utility margin (operating revenues less resource costs) or net income. In Washington and Idaho, all costs under the PGAs are passed through to customers. In Oregon, we absorb (cost or benefit) 10 percent of the difference between actual and projected natural gas costs included in retail rates for supply to the extent not hedged. Total net deferred natural gas costs among all jurisdictions were liabilities of 9.8 million as of 
 44 

Table of Contents AVISTA CORPORATION 

 September 30, 2024 and assets of 51.4 million as of December 31, 2023. This change primarily represents the collection of previously deferred natural gas costs and a decrease in natural gas prices. 
 Power Cost Deferrals and Recovery Mechanisms 
 The ERM is an accounting method used in Washington to track certain differences between actual power supply costs, net of the margin on wholesale sales of energy and sales of fuel, and the amount included in base retail rates for our customers. See the 2023 Form 10-K for a full discussion of the mechanics of the ERM and the various customer/Company sharing bands. Total net deferred power costs under the ERM were assets of 35.8 million and 37.6 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These deferred power cost balances represent amounts due from customers. Pursuant to WUTC requirements, should the cumulative deferral balance exceed 30 million in either the rebate or surcharge direction, we must make a filing with the WUTC to adjust customer rates to return the balance to customers or recover the balance from customers, as the case may be. As of September 30, 2024, 13.1 million of the 35.8 million is still being recovered through a rate surcharge to customers over a two-year period, effective July 1, 2023, as approved by the WUTC. 
 The PCA mechanism in Idaho allows us to modify electric rates on October 1 of each year with IPUC approval. Under the PCA mechanism, we defer 90 percent of the difference (positive or negative) between certain actual net power supply expenses and the amount included in base retail rates for our Idaho customers. The October 1 rate adjustments recover or rebate power supply costs deferred during the preceding July-June twelve-month period. Total net power supply costs deferred under the PCA mechanism were a liability of 12.5 million and an asset of 7.6 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Decoupling Mechanisms 
 Decoupling (also known as an FCA in Idaho) is a mechanism designed to sever the link between a utility's revenues and consumers' energy usage. In each of our jurisdictions, electric and natural gas revenues from residential and certain commercial customers are adjusted so as to be based on the number of customers and assumed "normal" kilowatt hour and therm sales, rather than being based on actual kilowatt hour and therm sales. The difference between revenues based on the number of customers and "normal" sales and revenues based on actual usage is deferred and either surcharged or rebated to customers beginning in the following year. See the 2023 Form 10-K for a discussion of the mechanisms in each jurisdiction. 
 Total net cumulative decoupling deferrals among all jurisdictions were regulatory assets of 8.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and regulatory liabilities of 14.9 million as of December 31, 2023. Decoupling regulatory assets represent amounts due from customers. Decoupling regulatory liabilities represent amounts due to customers. 
 See "Results of Operations - Avista Utilities" for further discussion of the amounts recorded to operating revenues in 2024 and 2023 related to the decoupling mechanisms.

 Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 
 The following graph shows the total change in net income for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, as well as the factors that caused such change (dollars in millions): 
 
 Electric utility revenues increased as a result of the effects of general rate cases and customer growth, partially offset by decreased wholesale revenues as part of our resource optimization activities. Natural gas utility revenues decreased slightly primarily due to decreased wholesale revenues. 
 Utility resource costs decreased primarily due to decreased commodity prices. These were partially offset by increased purchased volumes of power and natural gas, as well as increased amortizations of previously deferred costs compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 Utility operating expenses increased due to increased thermal generation costs, legal costs and employee medical expenses. In addition, net amortizations and deferrals associated with wildfire mitigation costs have increased, with corresponding increases to revenue which result in no impact to earnings. 
 Utility depreciation and amortization increased primarily due to additions to utility plant. 
 Interest expense increased primarily due to increased borrowings outstanding and increased interest rates compared to 2023. 
 Income tax benefits decreased primarily due to the decrease in tax customer credits which offset a portion of the bill impact of rate increases included in our prior general rate cases. This decrease in tax customer credits was partially offset by the timing impact of spreading these fewer available credits over the year as a percentage of pre-tax income based on the estimated annual effective tax rate. See "Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements" for further details and a reconciliation of our effective tax rate. 
 The decrease in earnings related to other is primarily due to increased taxes other than income tax, as well as net investment losses recorded in the third quarter of 2024 compared to net investment gains in 2023.

 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 The following graph shows the total change in net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as well as the factors that caused such change (dollars in millions): 
 
 Electric utility revenues increased as a result of the effects of general rate cases, the ERM surcharge to customers, and increased wholesale sales volumes and sales of fuel as part of our resource optimization activities. This was partially offset by decreased wholesale sale prices. Natural gas utility revenues increased primarily due to increased wholesale revenues and additional decoupling revenues associated with surcharge deferrals from lower customer use. 
 Electric utility resource costs increased primarily due to increased purchased power and fuel for generation, as well as increased power supply costs deferred in prior periods that are being amortized in 2024. Natural gas utility resource costs increased due to an increase in net amortizations of previously deferred costs. The increased net amortizations was partially offset by decreased purchased natural gas costs. 
 Utility operating expenses increased due to increased thermal generation costs, legal costs and employee medical expenses. In addition, net amortizations and deferrals associated with wildfire mitigation costs have increased, with corresponding increases to revenue which result in no impact to earnings. 
 Utility depreciation and amortization increased primarily due to additions to utility plant. 
 Interest expense increased primarily due to increased borrowings outstanding during the period and increased interest rates compared to 2023. 
 Income tax was an expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change is primarily due to the decrease in tax customer credits offsetting the bill impact of rate increases included in our prior general rate cases. This decrease in tax customer credits was partially offset by the timing impact of spreading these fewer available credits over the year as a percentage of pre-tax income based on the estimated annual effective tax rate. See "Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements" for further details and a reconciliation of our effective tax rate. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 The following discussion for Avista Utilities includes two financial measures considered non-GAAP financial measures : electric utility margin and natural gas utility margin. 
 47 

Table of Contents AVISTA CORPORATION 

 Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts included (excluded) in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Electric utility margin is electric operating revenues less electric resource costs, while natural gas utility margin is natural gas operating revenues less natural gas resource costs. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to electric and natural gas utility margin is utility operating revenues as presented in "Note 16 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements." 
 The presentation of electric utility margin and natural gas utility margin is intended to enhance the understanding of operating performance. We use these measures internally and believe they provide useful information to investors in their analysis of how changes in loads (due to weather, economic or other conditions), rates, supply costs and other factors impact our results of operations. Changes in loads, as well as power and natural gas supply costs, are generally deferred and recovered from customers through regulatory accounting mechanisms. Accordingly, the analysis of utility margin generally excludes most of the change in revenue resulting from these regulatory mechanisms. We present electric and natural gas utility margin separately below for Avista Utilities since each business has different cost sources, cost recovery mechanisms and jurisdictions, so we believe separate analysis is beneficial. These measures are not intended to replace utility operating revenues as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating performance. Reconciliations of operating revenues to utility margin are set forth below. 
 Results of Operations - Avista Utilities 
 Resource Optimization 
 We engage in resource optimization, which involves the selection from available energy resources to serve our load obligations and the use of these resources to capture economic value through wholesale market transactions, which is intended to lower net power and natural gas supply costs. Our resource optimization transactions can take the form of physical sales and purchases of energy (natural gas or electricity), electric capacity and fuel for electric generation, as well as financial derivative contracts related to capacity, energy, fuel and fuel transportation. See our 2023 Form 10-K for further discussion of our optimization activities. 
 We typically enter into multiple transactions simultaneously to capture value. Even though these transactions are considered together when determining the net impact, they are recorded in separate items within components of utility operating revenue and resource costs and can cause fluctuations in each item. Gains and losses on financial derivative contracts are included in certain line items below (such as wholesale sales and purchases of power and natural gas, sales of fuel, and other fuel costs). The ERM, PCA and PGAs are based on net supply costs and consider all transactions related to resource procurement and optimization (both physical and financial).

(a) Positive amounts are increases in decoupling revenue in the current year due to lower customer usage and will be surcharged to customers in future years. Negative amounts are decreases in decoupling revenue in the current year due to higher customer usage and will be rebated to customers in future years. 

(b) Positive amounts are increases in decoupling revenue in the current year and are related to the amortization of rebate balances that resulted in prior years due to higher customer usage and are being refunded to customers (causing a corresponding decrease in retail revenue from customers) in the current year. Negative amounts are decreases in decoupling revenue in the current year and are related to the amortization of surcharge balances that resulted in prior years due to lower customer usage and are being surcharged to customers (causing a corresponding increase in retail revenue from customers) in the current year. 

Total electric revenues increased 7.7 million for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023. The primary changes that occurred during the period were as follows: 
 A 29.6 million increase in retail electric revenue due to an increase in retail rates (increased revenues by 22.0 million), and an increase in MWhs sold (increased revenues by 7.6 million). 

o Retail rates increased mainly due to the effects of our general rate cases. 

o Retail sales volumes increased primarily due to customer growth, including a new large industrial customer that we began serving on August 1, 2024. 

A 23.8 million decrease in wholesale electric revenues due to a decrease in sales prices (decreased revenues 33.5 million), partially offset by an increase in sales volumes (increased revenues 9.7 million). The change in volumes was due to increased opportunities to optimize our generation assets based on market conditions. 

Electric decoupling revenue was consistent with the third quarter of 2023, with decreased current year rebate deferrals (due to lower use per customer), offset by decreased amortization of prior year rebate balances. 

A 3.3 million increase in other electric revenues primarily resulting from increased REC and transmission revenues.

Total natural gas revenues decreased 0.8 million for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023. The primary changes that occurred during the period were as follows: 
 A 2.0 million increase in natural gas retail revenues (including industrial, which is included in other) due to higher retail rates (increased revenues 2.9 million), partially offset by decreased sales volumes (decreased revenues 0.9 million). The decrease in sales volumes was primarily due to a 7 percent decrease in residential usage, resulting from warmer weather. Retail rates increased mainly due to the effects of our general rate cases and rate increases associated with the CCA. 

A 6.1 million decrease in wholesale natural gas revenues due to a decrease in prices (decreased revenues 8.5 million), partially offset by an increase in sales volumes (increased revenues 2.4 million). The increase in volumes is related to increased optimization opportunities. 

A 0.4 million increase in natural gas decoupling revenues primarily due decreased amortization of prior year surcharge balances. 

A 2.3 million increase in other gas revenues primarily due to amortizations of previously deferred CCA revenues, which began April 1, 2024.

 Total electric resource costs in the graph above include intracompany resource costs of 6.0 million and 12.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Total electric resource costs decreased 9.4 million for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023. The primary changes that occurred during the period were as follows: 
 A 5.2 million decrease in power purchased due to a decrease in wholesale prices (decreased costs 14.5 million), partially offset by an increase in the volume of power purchases (increased costs 9.3 million). 

A 7.6 million decrease in fuel for generation. This was due to a decrease in fuel prices, as well as a decrease in thermal generation compared to the third quarter of 2023. 

A 3.0 million decrease in other fuel costs. These costs represent fuel and the related derivative instruments purchased for generation which were later sold when conditions indicated it was more economical to sell the fuel as part of the resource optimization process. When the fuel is sold either physically or through a derivative instrument, that revenue is included in sales of fuel. 

A 6.4 million increase in other electric resource costs, primarily related to an increase in amortization of previously deferred costs, as well as an increase in the deferral of funds related to our customer assistance payment programs (low income rate assistance and demand side management).

 A 2.5 million decrease in natural gas retail revenues (including industrial, which is included in other) due to decreased sales volumes (decreased revenues 11.5 million), partially offset by higher retail rates (increased revenues 9.0 million) 

o Retail natural gas sales volumes decreased primarily due to decreased use by all our customer classes, partially offset by customer growth. Compared to the first three quarters of 2023, residential use per customer decreased 6 percent, commercial use per customer decreased 1 percent due to warmer weather and decreased heating loads. Industrial use per customer decreased 12 percent. 

o Retail rates increased mainly due to the effects of our general rate cases and rate increases associated with the CCA. 

An 8.8 million increase in wholesale natural gas revenues due to an increase in prices (increased revenues 7.9 million), and an increase in sales volumes (increased revenues 0.9 million). The increase in prices includes the impact of

 Total electric resource costs increased 63.0 million for the first three quarters of 2024 as compared to the first three quarters of 2023. The primary changes that occurred during the period were as follows: 
 A 26.6 million increase in purchased power costs due to an increase in wholesale prices (increased costs 17.3 million), and an increase in the volume of power purchases (increased costs 9.3 million). In mid-January 2024, our service territory experienced much colder than normal weather, requiring purchases at a time when wholesale prices were substantially elevated due to capacity constraints in our region. 

A 6.6 million increase in fuel for generation primarily due to financial gains recognized in the first quarter of 2023 associated with our hedging activities, which net with our physical purchases, as well as increased thermal generation as compared to the prior year, because of higher sales volumes (retail and wholesale activities combined). 

A 32.8 million increase in other electric resource costs related to an increase in amortization of previously deferred costs, and an increase in deferred benefits related to current year power supply costs. There was also an increase in the deferral of funds related to our customer assistance payment programs (low income rate assistance and demand side management).

 Total natural gas resource costs increased 19.9 million for the first three quarters of 2024 as compared to the first three quarters of 2023 primarily due to the following: 
 A 68.1 million decrease in natural gas purchased due to a decrease in the price of natural gas (decreased costs 66.7 million), and a decrease in volumes (decreased costs 1.4 million). The decrease in the price of natural gas occurred primarily in the first quarter of 2024 due to milder weather (other than a specific January cold event). 

An 88.0 million increase in other primarily related to a decrease in deferred costs during the period, as well as an increase in amortization of previously deferred costs. Deferred costs decreased during the period due to lower natural gas prices, mainly in the first quarter of 2024.

 Net income for AEL P was less than 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the first three quarters of 2024, net income was 5.1 million, compared to 5.7 million in 2023. The decrease in net income resulted from increased operating expenses. 
 Re sults of Operations - Other Businesses 
 Our other businesses had a net loss of 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net income of 0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net losses were 3.5 million for the first three quarters of 2024, compared to a net loss of 2.6 million in 2023. 
 The fluctuation in results is primarily related to higher net investment losses due to changes in fair value and recognizing our portion of equity investment losses. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements. Changes in these estimates and assumptions are considered reasonably possible and may have a material effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements and thus, actual results could differ from the amounts reported and disclosed herein. Our critical accounting policies that require the use of estimates and assumptions were discussed in detail in the 2023 Form 10-K and have not changed materially. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overall Liquidity 
 Our sources of overall liquidity and the requirements for liquidity have not materially changed in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. See the 2023 Form 10-K for further discussion. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 212.3 million of available liquidity under the Avista Corp. committed line of credit, 43.0 million of available liquidity under our letter of credit facility, and 20.7 million under the AEL P committed line of credit. With our existing credit facilities and the expected issuances of common stock and long-term debt within the next year, we believe we have adequate liquidity to meet our needs for the next 12 months. 
 In April 2024, we closed on the remarketing of 66.7 million and 17.0 million of the City of Forsyth, Montana Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds due in 2032 and 2034, respectively. The proceeds from the remarketing of these bonds were used to repay borrowings under our committed line of credit. 
 Review of Condensed Consolidated Cash Flow Statement 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 444.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 393.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Contributing to the increase are power and natural gas deferrals being amortized and recovered from customers in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to large deferrals in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net impact of these deferrals on operating cash flows was a 111.5 million increase in 2024 compared to 2023. The change in accounts payable balances during the period also contributed 63.5 million to the increased operating cash flows, as there were large balances paid during the first half of 2023 associated with elevated commodity prices at the 
 61 

Table of Contents AVISTA CORPORATION 

 end of 2022. These increases were partially offset by a 126.6 million decrease in collateral returned related to our derivative instruments and a 52.2 million decrease related to the change in accounts receivable, both of which were also impacted by elevated commodity prices at the end of 2022. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 410.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 368.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We paid 405.4 million for utility capital expenditures in 2024, compared to 359.3 million in 2023. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 60.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash used of 29.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In the first three quarters of 2024, we issued 83.7 million of long-term debt, compared to 250.0 million in the first three quarters of 2023. We also decreased our short-term borrowings by 61.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 241.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In addition, we issued 35.7 million of common stock and paid 112.5 million in dividends in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to issuing common stock of 88.2 million and paying 105.2 million in dividends in 2023. 
 Capital Resources 
 Our consolidated capital structure, including the current portion of long-term debt and short-term borrowings consisted of the following as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands):

 (1) Letters of credit are not reflected on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. If a letter of credit were drawn upon by the holder, we would have an immediate obligation to reimburse the bank that issued that letter. 

The Avista Corp. credit facilities contain customary covenant and default provisions, including a change in control (as defined in the agreements). The events of default under each of the credit facilities also include a cross default from other indebtedness (as defined) and, in the case of the letter of credit agreement, other obligations. The committed line of credit agreement also includes a covenant which does not permit our ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated total capitalization to be greater than 65 percent at any time. As of September 30, 2024, we complied with this covenant with a ratio of 54.8 percent.

 The AEL P credit facility contains customary covenants and default provisions including a covenant which does not permit the ratio of consolidated total debt at AEL P to consolidated total capitalization at AEL P (including the impact of the Snettisham obligation) to be greater than 67.5 percent at any time. As of September 30, 2024, AEL P complied with this covenant with a ratio of 47.8 percent. 
 As of September 30, 2024, Avista Corp. and its subsidiaries complied with all of the covenants of their financing agreements, and none of Avista Corp.'s subsidiaries constituted a significant subsidiary as defined in Avista Corp.'s committed line of credit. 
 See "Note 8 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements" for additional information regarding our short-term borrowing arrangements. 
 Liquidity Expectations 
 During April 2024, we remarketed revenue bonds previously held by us, resulting in an additional 83.7 million of long-term debt. We do not expect to issue any additional long-term debt in 2024. We expect to issue 70 million of common stock in 2024 (including 35.7 million issued through September 30, 2024). 
 Capital Expenditures 
 We are making capital investments to enhance service and system reliability for our customers and replace aging infrastructure, and expect Avista Utilities' capital expenditures to be about 515 million in 2024. We expect Avista Utilities' capital expenditures to be 525 million in 2025, 575 million in 2026, and 600 million in 2027. See the 2023 Form 10-K for further information on our expected capital expenditures.

 Pension Plan 
 Avista Utilities 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we contributed 10.0 million to the pension plan, and do not expect further contributions in 2024. We expect to contribute a total of 40.0 million to the pension plan in the period 2025 through 2028, with an annual contribution of 10.0 million. 
 The final determination of pension plan contributions for future periods is subject to multiple variables, most of which are beyond our control, including changes to the fair value of pension plan assets, changes in actuarial assumptions (in particular the discount rate used in determining the benefit obligation), or changes in federal legislation. We may change our pension plan contributions in the future depending on changes to any variables, including those listed above. 
 See "Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements" for additional information regarding the pension plan. 
 Environmental Issues and Contingencies 
 Our environmental issues and contingencies disclosures have not materially changed during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 except as follows: 
 Washington State Building Codes 
 In April 2022, the Washington State Building Code Council (SBCC) approved a revised energy code requiring most new commercial buildings and large multifamily buildings to install all-electric space heating. An amendment to the code allows for natural gas to supplement electric heat pumps. In addition, in November 2022, the SBCC approved new building and energy codes for residential housing, requiring new residential buildings in Washington to use electricity as the primary heat source. 
 Both the commercial and residential building and energy codes were the subject of legal challenges in both Washington State Superior Court (the State Action) and in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Washington (the Federal Action). In the Federal Action, to which the Company was a party, the plaintiffs challenged the amendments on the grounds that they were preempted by the federal Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), citing the Ninth Circuit s decision in California Restaurant Association v. Berkeley (the Berkeley Decision), which involved similar restrictions on the use of natural gas in new construction in Berkeley, California. 
 In May 2023, the SBCC voted to delay the effective date of the code amendments and commenced an emergency rulemaking process to evaluate additional amendments to the code in light of the Berkeley Decision. As a result of this action, in July 2023, the Federal District Court declined to issue a preliminary injunction to prevent the amendments from taking effect. The plaintiffs in the Federal Action subsequently dismissed the action, without prejudice to their ability to refile after the SBCC rulemaking process is complete. 
 The SBCC has since voted to approve revised residential and commercial energy regulations that continue to require new residential and commercial buildings in Washington to use electricity as the primary heat source. In light of this action, the plaintiffs in the State Action amended their complaint to challenge the new regulations. The State Action remains pending. 
 In May 2024, we, along with Cascade Natural Gas Corporation, Northwest Natural Gas Company, and a coalition of homebuilders, heating unit dealers and other parties, filed a lawsuit challenging the approved building codes on the grounds that they are preempted by EPCA. The lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington. This lawsuit remains pending. 
 Over time, the building code changes would likely have an adverse impact on our natural gas business and natural gas customers but could also have a positive effect on our electric business. While we are in the process of studying the implications of the changes on our business, at this time we are not able to quantify the likely net effect, positive or negative, on our overall results of operations over the long term. However, the changes would clearly require that additional generating capacity be available to utilities and customers in Washington state.

 Washington Climate Commitment Act 
 The CCA, and its implementing regulations, established a cap and trade program to reduce GHG emissions and achieve the GHG limits previously established under state law. The final rules implement a cap on emissions, provide mechanisms for the sale and tracking of tradable emissions allowances and establish additional compliance and accountability measures. The state issues allowances necessary to serve our Washington retail electric load; off-system wholesale sales may result in additional obligation costs. The CCA also has direct impacts on our Idaho electric operations as it applies to power that is delivered in Washington but is allocated to Idaho customers (wholesale sales) or power generated in Washington that is delivered to Idaho customers. Annually, the model and its resulting calculations must be certified by an independent third party and submitted to the Washington Department of Ecology (Ecology) for approval. If the independent third party or Ecology disagrees with the approach or any of the calculations, it could result in a change to the number of allowances needed for compliance and could result in changes to anticipated costs for our electric operations. For Washington electric, we are allowed to defer any incremental costs associated with the CCA in accordance with our regulatory accounting order; however, in Idaho we are not allowed to pass any costs associated with CCA compliance to Idaho customers. See "Note 15 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements" for further discussion of the CCA costs associated with our electric operations and impacts on our financial results. 
 For our Washington natural gas operations, we expect additional financial burdens associated with compliance which will be deferred in accordance with our regulatory accounting order in Washington (see "Executive Overview" for discussion of the CCA). 
 SEC Climate Disclosure Rules 
 In March 2024, the SEC adopted final rules requiring certain climate disclosures to be incorporated into SEC filings. The final rules as written are effective for our filings starting with the 2025 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 After the final rules were published by the SEC, multiple lawsuits were made, including allegations that the SEC does not have statutory rulemaking authority over climate reporting, among other various allegations. The SEC requested the cases be consolidated into one action, and the consolidated action is now before the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. 
 In April 2024, the SEC voluntarily stayed the implementation of the final rules. In the stay order, the SEC noted it intends to vigorously defend the validity of the final rules. 
 EPA Regulations for Power Plants 
 On April 25, 2024, the EPA released a package of final regulations addressed to electric generation facilities. These include: 
 Greenhouse gas regulations for new natural gas-based turbines and existing coal-based units, pursuant to section 111 of the Clean Air Act . This rule finalizes (a) the repeal of the Affordable Clean Energy rule; (b) guidelines for GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired steam generating electric generating units; and (c) revisions to existing performance standards for new, reconstructed or heavily modified fossil fuel-fired stationary combustion turbine electric generating units. 

Supplemental Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Steam Electric Power Generating Point Source Category (ELG Rule) . The ELG Rule applies to wastewater discharges from coal-based generating units and establishes pollution control requirements. The Rule builds upon the 2015 and 2020 ELG Rules. It includes a subcategory of requirements for coal plants that will be retired or repowered by the end of 2028 and provides additional compliance pathways for coal plants that retire by the end of 2034. 

Updated Mercury and Air Tox Standards, pursuant to section 112 of the Clean Air Act (MATS Rule) . The MATS Rule sets emissions limits for filterable particulate matter for coal-based generating units. The Rule reduces those limits from the standards that were originally set in 2012. 

Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals from Electric Utilities Legacy CCR Surface Impoundments (CCR Rule) . The CCR Rule builds on 2015 regulations, which apply to active power plants that dispose of coal combustion residuals in 

65 

Table of Contents AVISTA CORPORATION 

 surface impoundments or landfills, by regulating inactive surface impoundments at inactive power plants and CCR management units at active and inactive power plants. 

We continue to analyze each of these rules to assess the impact, if any, it may have on our existing generating units, including Colstrip and/or our natural gas-fired generating units. A substantial number of legal challenges have been filed regarding these rules. At this time, we do not believe the implementation of these rules will impact our agreement to transfer our Colstrip ownership to NorthWestern, which is planned to close on December 31, 2025. 
 In anticipation of a 2027 compliance date, Talen, as operator of Colstrip, has proposed that the owners begin design and engineering work on emission control technology that would ensure compliance with the rule. That work is anticipated to begin in 2024 and continue through completion of the project in 2027. We are currently in discussions with NorthWestern regarding how our potential share of the costs for this work should be allocated. 
 Along with the other owners (including the operator), we have assessed the CCR Rule and believe there will not be a material change to our asset retirement obligation for Colstrip. 
 See the 2023 Form 10-K for further discussion of our environmental issues and contingencies. 
 Enterprise Risk Management 
 The material risks to our businesses, and our mitigation process and procedures to address these risks, were discussed in our 2023 Form 10-K and have not materially changed during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. See the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Financial Risk 
 Our financial risks have not materially changed during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Refer to the 2023 Form 10-K. The financial risks included below are required interim disclosures, even if they have not materially changed from December 31, 2023. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We use a variety of techniques to manage our interest rate risks. We have an interest rate risk policy and a policy to limit our variable rate exposures to a percentage of total capitalization. Additionally, interest rate risk is managed by monitoring market conditions when timing the issuance of long-term debt and optional debt redemptions and establishing fixed rate long-term debt with varying maturities. See "Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements" for a summary of our interest rate swap derivatives outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and the amount of additional collateral we would have to post in certain circumstances. 
 Credit Risk 
 Under the terms of interest rate swap derivatives, we may be required to post cash or letters of credit as collateral depending on fluctuations in the fair value of the instrument. A downgrade in our credit ratings could further impact the amount of collateral required. See Credit Ratings in the 2023 Form 10-K for further information. As of September 30, 2024, we had interest rate swap derivatives outstanding with a notional amount totaling 10.0 million and we had no cash deposited as collateral and no letters of credit outstanding for these interest rate swap derivatives. If our credit ratings were lowered to below investment grade based on our interest rate swap derivatives outstanding at September 30, 2024, the amounts we would be required to post for additional collateral are immaterial. 
 66 

Table of Contents AVISTA CORPORATION 

 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash deposited as collateral of 24.8 million and letters of credit of 7.0 million outstanding related to our energy contracts. Price movements and/or a downgrade in our credit ratings or other established credit criteria could impact further the amount of collateral required. See Credit Ratings in the 2023 Form 10-K for further information. For example, in addition to limiting our ability to conduct transactions, if our credit ratings were lowered to below investment grade based on our positions outstanding at September 30, 2024 (including contracts considered derivatives and those considered non-derivatives), we would potentially be required to post the following additional collateral (in thousands):

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures about Market Risk 
 The information required by this item is set forth in the Enterprise Risk Management section of "Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and is incorporated herein by reference. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company has disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) (Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports it files or submits under the Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without 
 67 

Table of Contents AVISTA CORPORATION 

 limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. With the participation of the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the Company's management evaluated its disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Based upon this evaluation, the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective at a reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 
 There have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the third quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
