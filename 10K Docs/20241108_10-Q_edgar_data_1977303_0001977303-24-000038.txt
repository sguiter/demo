 per share, of the Company (the "Company Shares"), including the Company Shares represented by CHESS depositary interests issued by the Company and listed on the securities exchange operated by ASX Limited, then outstanding will be transferred from the shareholders of the Company to Buyer (or an affiliate of Buyer) in exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to per Company Share (the "Rio Tinto Transaction"). 
 If the Rio Tinto Transaction is consummated, the Company s ordinary shares will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and the Company s registration under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, will be terminated as promptly as practicable after the effective time of the Rio Tinto Transaction, and the quotation on the Australian Securities Exchange Ltd of the CHESS depositary interests issued by the Company will be suspended immediately prior to the effective time of the Rio Tinto Transaction. 
 The closing of the Rio Tinto Transaction is subject to customary closing conditions under the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement, including, among others: the approval of the Scheme by the Company s shareholders; all applicable governmental consents under specified antitrust and investment screening laws having been obtained and remaining in full force and effect and all applicable waiting periods having expired, lapsed or been terminated (as applicable); no governmental entity of a competent jurisdiction having issued any order that is in effect and restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits the consummation of the Rio Tinto Transaction and no governmental entity having jurisdiction over any party having adopted any law that is in effect and makes consummation of the Rio Tinto Transaction illegal or otherwise prohibited; the representations and warranties of each of the Company and Parent being true and correct to the extent required by, and subject to the applicable materiality standards set forth in, the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement; each of the Company, Parent and Buyer having in all material respects performed the obligations and complied with the covenants required to be performed or complied with by it under the

 million termination fee to Rio Tinto in the case of certain events described in the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement, including if the Company terminates the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement in connection with the Board of Directors of the Company changing its recommendation and if Rio Tinto terminates the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement due to the Board of Directors of the Company changing its recommendation. The termination fee may also become payable by the Company if the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances and the Company enters into an agreement for an alternative transaction within twelve months of such termination. However, this right to terminate the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement will not be available to the Company or Parent if such party has materially breached the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement and the breach is the principal cause of the failure of the closing to have occurred prior to such date. The Company or Parent may elect to terminate the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement in certain other circumstances, including if the Company s shareholders fail to approve the Rio Tinto Transaction at the shareholder meetings, and the Company and Parent can mutually decide to terminate the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement at any time prior to the closing, before or after the required approval by the Company s shareholders. 
 The foregoing summary of the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement and the Rio Tinto Transaction contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms and conditions of the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 to this Form 10-Q. 

Note 2: 
 The financial statements included in this report reflect all normal and recurring adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of our condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the condensed consolidated results of operations, the condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income and the condensed consolidated statement of changes in equity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the condensed consolidated cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. For entities that we control, but own less than 100 , we record the minority ownership as noncontrolling interest. The unaudited results of operations for the interim periods reported are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year. These statements, therefore, should be read in conjunction with the annual consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the "2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K").

 to days. 
 In determining when the control of goods is transferred, we typically assess, among other things, the transfer of title and risk of loss and the shipping terms of the contract. 
 We record amounts billed for shipping and handling fees as revenue. Costs incurred for shipping and handling are recorded in cost of sales. When we perform shipping and handling activities after the transfer of control to the customer (e.g., when control transfers prior to delivery), they are considered fulfillment activities, and accordingly, the costs are accrued to cost of sales when the related revenue is recognized. 
 Amounts billed for sales and use taxes, VAT, and certain excise and other specific transactional taxes imposed on revenue-producing transactions are presented on a net basis and excluded from revenue in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. We record a liability until remitted to the respective taxing authority. 
 We satisfy our obligations by transferring goods and services in exchange for consideration from customers. The timing of performance sometimes differs from the timing the associated consideration is received from the customer, thus resulting in the recognition of a contract asset or liability. These may arise from provisional pricing within certain of our customer contracts, or if the customer s payment of consideration is received prior to completion of our related performance obligation. Provisional pricing results in variable consideration which we estimate by using an expected value method taking into account all information that is reasonably available including publicly available pricing forecasts. We only include variable consideration within the transaction price to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of revenue recognized will not occur.

 The carrying amounts of the AROs as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was million and million, respectively. These amounts are included in Accrued and other current liabilities and Other long-term liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 Blue Chip Swap 
 Our wholly owned subsidiaries in Argentina use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Argentina peso-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at each balance sheet date to the official currency exchange rate then in effect which represents the exchange rate available for external commerce (import payments and export collections) and financial payments, with currency remeasurement and other transaction gains and losses recognized in earnings. In September 2019, the President of Argentina reinstituted exchange controls restricting foreign currency purchases in an attempt to stabilize Argentina s financial markets. As a result, a legal trading mechanism known as the Blue Chip Swap emerged in Argentina for all individuals or entities to transfer U.S. dollars out of and into Argentina. The Blue Chip Swap rate is the implicit exchange rate resulting from the Blue Chip Swap transaction. In the first half of 2024, U.S. dollars were transferred into Argentina through the Blue Chip Swap method whereby we realized a gain from the purchase in U.S. dollars and sale in Argentina pesos of Argentina Sovereign U.S. dollar-denominated bonds. The gain of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was recorded to Other (gains)/losses in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 Li-Metal transaction 
 On August 2, 2024, Arcadium announced it acquired the lithium metal division of Li-Metal Corp. The all-cash million USD transaction includes the intellectual property and physical assets related to lithium metal production, including a pilot production facility in Ontario, Canada.

 Arcadium Lithium CHESS Depositary Instrument (a "CDI") quoted on the Australian Stock Exchange (each CDI representing a beneficial ownership interest in Arcadium ordinary share), or Arcadium ordinary share (par value per share) and (b) a merger, whereby Merger Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary of Irish IntermediateCo (a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Arcadium) merged with and into Livent, with Livent as the surviving entity. Each share of Livent common stock, par value per share (each, a "Livent Share"), was converted into the right to receive Arcadium ordinary shares. 
 Pursuant to the Allkem Livent Merger, Arcadium ordinary shares (including related to accelerated PRSU awards) were issued to former Livent stockholders and Arcadium ordinary shares (comprising Arcadium ordinary shares and CDIs in respect of Arcadium ordinary shares) were issued to former Allkem shareholders. 
 Fair value of converted Allkem performance rights attributable to pre-combination service Total consideration 
 The Allkem Livent Merger meets the criteria to be accounted for as a business combination and is accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting with Livent being treated as the accounting acquirer. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of Allkem and its subsidiaries are recorded at their respective fair values as of the date of completion of the Allkem Livent Merger and the difference between the fair value of the consideration paid for the acquired entity and fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. 
 The fair value of the assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interest of Allkem under the business combination guidance, including the impact of income taxes, is preliminary. The preliminary fair value allocation is subject to change for up to one year subsequent to the Acquisition Date. Determining the fair value of the assets and liabilities of Allkem requires judgement and certain assumptions to be made, the most significant of these being related to the valuation of Allkem's mining properties and rights. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, adjustments were made within the permitted measurement period for the following: an increase to property, plant and equipment of million, decrease to deferred income tax assets of million, increase to accounts payable trade and other of million, decrease to income taxes of million, decrease to environmental liabilities of million, decrease to deferred income tax liabilities of million, increase to other long term liabilities of million, and a net decrease in goodwill of million. The measurement period adjustments have been reflected as current period adjustments in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, in accordance with the guidance in ASU 2015-16 Business Combinations. The measurement period adjustments had no effect on earnings or cash in the current period. 
 Transaction and related costs directly attributable to the acquisition of Allkem, consisting primarily of advisor fees, legal fees, accounting fees, and certain deal related bonuses were million and million, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The costs were expensed as incurred and are included in restructuring and other charges.

 Property, Plant and Equipment 
 Property, plant and equipment is inclusive of the fair value of mineral rights totaling million and non-mineral rights property, plant and equipment totaling million. The fair value of the mineral rights was estimated using the multi-period excess earnings method. The excess earnings methodology is an income approach methodology that estimates the projected cash flows of the business attributable to the asset, net of charges for the use of other identifiable assets of the business including working capital, fixed assets, and other intangible assets. Mineral rights are depreciated using a units-of-production method while all other property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method. 
 Goodwill 
 Goodwill from acquisitions represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. The amount disclosed within the table, subject to change for up to one year subsequent to the Acquisition Date, is attributable to the value of growth opportunities and expected synergies created by incorporating Allkem's business and operations into the Company's operations and the value of the assembled workforce. The goodwill has no amortizable basis for income tax purposes.

In addition to capital contributions made through its investment in TLC, Allkem has also provided past funding through loans. At the Acquisition Date, the carrying values of the investment in TLC and a fully reserved loan receivable were zero and fair value was deemed to be equal to carrying value.

The options granted in 2024 will vest on the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant, subject generally to continued employment, and cost is recognized over the vesting period. Incentive and non-qualified options granted under the Arcadium Plan expire not later than years from the grant date. 
 Under the Arcadium Plan, awards of restricted share units ("RSUs") vest over periods designated by the Arcadium Committee. The RSUs granted in 2024 to employees will vest equally on the first, second and third anniversaries of the grant date, subject generally to continued employment, and cost is recognized over the vesting period. The RSUs granted to non-employee directors in 2024 vest at the Company's next annual meeting of shareholders following the grant date. Compensation cost is recognized over the vesting periods based on the market value of Arcadium ordinary shares on the grant date of the award. 
 Allkem Replacement Awards 
 Pursuant to the Allkem Transaction Agreement, the equity awards of Allkem (including performance rights) outstanding as of immediately prior to the closing of the Allkem Livent Merger were converted into equity awards denominated in shares of Arcadium ordinary shares. The Company issued time-based vesting restricted shares in connection with the conversion of such awards. The estimated fair value of the portion of the Allkem equity awards for which the required service period had been completed at the time of the closing of the Allkem Livent Merger was treated as purchase consideration. The remaining estimated fair value is recorded as compensation expense over the remainder of the service period associated with the awards. The Allkem Replacement Awards are authorized for issuance under the Arcadium Plan. 
 Treatment of Equity Awards in the Rio Tinto Transaction 
 At the completion of the Rio Tinto Transaction, the Company s outstanding equity awards will be treated as follows: 
 Restricted Stock Units: Each outstanding RSU that is held by a non-employee director will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to per Company share. Each other outstanding RSU will be cancelled and exchanged for an award of restricted stock units with respect to a number of ordinary shares of either Rio Tinto plc or Rio Tinto Limited (each, a "Listed Share"), determined by multiplying the number of Company shares subject to such RSU by the Equity Award Conversion Ratio (as defined in the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement). 
 Restricted Share Rights (or "Allkem Replacement Awards" per the Allkem Transaction Agreement): Each outstanding restricted share right with respect to Company shares, whether vested or unvested (each, a "Restricted Share Right"), will be cancelled and exchanged for an award of restricted share rights with respect to a number of Listed Shares, determined by multiplying the number of Company shares subject to such Restricted Share Right by the Equity Award Conversion Ratio. 
 Stock Options: Each outstanding stock option with respect to the Company s shares, whether vested or unvested (each, a "Company Stock Option"), will be cancelled and exchanged for an option to purchase a number of applicable Listed Shares determined by multiplying (i) the number of Company shares subject to such Company Stock Option by (ii) the Equity Award Conversion Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share. Such stock option will have a per-share exercise price determined by dividing (i) the exercise price per Company share at which such Company Stock Option

 Share Options 
 The grant date fair values of the share options granted in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were estimated using the Black-Scholes option valuation model, the key assumptions for which are listed in the table below. The expected volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of a group of of our publicly traded peers that operate in the specialty chemical sector. The expected life represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury securities with terms equal to the expected timing of share option exercises as of the grant date. The dividend yield assumption reflects anticipated dividends on Arcadium's ordinary shares. Arcadium share options granted in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 will vest equally on the first, second and third anniversaries of the grant date and expire from the date of grant. 
 The following summary shows

 Note 19 : 

The estimated fair value of our foreign exchange forward contracts has been determined using standard pricing models which take into account the present value of expected future cash flows discounted to the balance sheet date. These standard pricing models utilize inputs derived from, or corroborated by, observable market data such as currency and commodity spot and forward rates. 
 Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The inputs used to measure fair value are classified into the following hierarchy: 
 
 Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
 Level 2 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, or unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability. 
 Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. 
 The estimated fair value and the carrying amount of debt were million and million, respectively, as of September 30, 2024. Our 2025 Notes are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 
 Use of Derivative Financial Instruments to Manage Risk 
 We mitigate certain financial exposures connected to currency risk through a program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates.

 A net after-tax gain of million, representing open foreign currency exchange contracts, will be realized in earnings during the year ending December 31, 2024 if spot rates in the future are consistent with market rates as of September 30, 2024. The actual effect on earnings will be dependent on the actual spot rates when the forecasted transactions occur. We recognize derivative gains and losses in the Cost of sales line in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 Derivatives Not Designated As Cash Flow Hedging Instruments 
 We hold certain forward contracts that have not been designated as cash flow hedging instruments for accounting purposes. Contracts used to hedge the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities are not designated as cash flow hedging instruments and changes in the fair value of these items are recorded in earnings.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION 
 Statement under the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: We and our representatives may from time to time make written or oral statements that are "forward-looking" and provide other than historical information, including statements contained in Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, in our other filings with the SEC, or in reports to our shareholders. 
 In some cases, we have identified forward-looking statements by such words or phrases as "will likely result," "is confident that," "expect," "expects," "should," "could," "may," "will continue to," "believe," "believes," "anticipates," "predicts," "forecasts," "estimates," "projects," "potential," "intends" or similar expressions identifying "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the negative of those words and phrases. Such forward-looking statements are based on our current views and assumptions regarding future events, future business conditions and the outlook for the Company based on currently available information. These forward-looking statements may include projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth strategies, anticipated trends in our business, the anticipated timing for, and outcome and effects of, the post-merger integration of Livent and Allkem and the anticipated timing, expected completion and impacts of the Rio Tinto Transaction and the potential effects should the Rio Tinto Transaction not be completed on a timely basis or at all for any reason. These statements are only predictions based on our current expectations and projections about future events. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from any results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forward-looking statement. 
 Investors are cautioned to carefully consider the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, level of activity, performance, achievements, timing for, or outcome and effects of, the post-merger integration of Livent and Allkem, or the timing, completion and effects of the Rio Tinto Transaction. Moreover, neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of any of these forward-looking statements. We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. We are under no duty to and specifically decline to undertake any obligation to publicly revise or update any of these forward-looking statements after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to conform our prior statements to actual results, revised expectations or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events. 
 APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and that have or could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We have described certain of our accounting estimates in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The SEC has defined critical accounting estimates as those estimates made in accordance with U.S. GAAP that involve a significant level of measurement uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or operating performance of a company. 
 We have reviewed these accounting estimates, identifying those that we believe contain matters that are inherently uncertain, have significant levels of subjectivity and complex judgments and are critical to the preparation and understanding of our condensed consolidated financial statements. We have described our critical accounting estimates in Item 7 of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. These include revenue recognition, trade and other receivables, impairments and valuation of long-lived assets and equity method investments, accounting for business combinations, and income taxes. We have reviewed these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Critical accounting estimates are central to our presentation of results of operations and financial condition and require management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates on certain matters. We base our estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience, current conditions and other reasonable factors. In addition to the critical accounting estimates described in our Form 10-K, we have added Resources , "Inventory", "Depreciation and amortization" and "Goodwill" described hereinafter. 
 As a result of inflation, high interest rates and various global conflicts, there has been uncertainty and disruption in the global economy and financial markets. The estimates used for, but not limited to, revenue recognition and the collectability of trade receivables, impairment and valuation of long-lived assets, and income taxes could be impacted. We have assessed the impact and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially affected the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These 
 46 

estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 OVERVIEW 
 Arcadium Lithium is a leading global lithium chemicals producer with a diversified product offering and enhanced business-critical scale, including a presence in three major lithium geographies (i.e., the South American "lithium triangle," Western Australia and Canada) and a lithium deposit base that is among the largest in the world. We are a pure-play, fully integrated lithium company, with a long, proven history of producing performance lithium compounds. Our primary products, namely battery-grade lithium hydroxide, lithium carbonate, spodumene, butyllithium and high purity lithium metal are critical inputs used in various performance applications. 
 As a result of our focus on supplying performance lithium compounds for use in the rapidly growing electric vehicle ("EV") and broader energy storage battery markets, we expect our revenue generated from lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate, and from energy storage applications to increase over time. We also expect our revenue by geography to remain at similar proportions until supply chains further regionalize in North America and Europe. We intend to maintain our leadership positions in other high-performance markets such as non-rechargeable batteries, greases, pharmaceuticals and polymers. 
 We believe that we have earned a reputation as a leading supplier in the markets we serve, based on the performance of our products in our customers production processes and our ability to provide application know-how and technical support. In the EV market, we are one of a small number of lithium suppliers whose battery-grade lithium hydroxide has been qualified by global customers for use in their cathode material production that is ultimately used in numerous EV programs at scale. Throughout our history, as end market application technologies have evolved, we have worked closely with our customers to understand their changing performance requirements and have developed products to address their needs. 
 As a vertically integrated lithium producer, we benefit from operating some of the lowest cost lithium mineral deposits in the world that also have a favorable, industry leading sustainability footprint. Arcadium has been extracting lithium brine at its F nix operations at the Salar del Hombre Muerto in Argentina for more than 25 years , and has been producing various lithium compounds for approximately 80 years. Our operational history provides us with a deep understanding of the process of extracting lithium compounds from brine safely and sustainably. We have developed proprietary process knowledge that enables us to produce high quality, low impurity lithium carbonate and lithium chloride, and helps us to produce industry leading quality downstream products. We source the majority of our lithium for use in the production of performance lithium compounds from multiple low-cost operations in Argentina. Our operations in Argentina are expandable, giving us the ability to increase our lithium carbonate and lithium chloride production to meet increasing demand. We also have a hard rock mining operation in Australia producing spodumene concentrate. 
 We are one of a few lithium compound producers with global manufacturing capabilities. The battery-grade lithium hydroxide in the U.S., China and Japan that we produce today uses lithium carbonate as feedstock. We use lithium chloride to produce lithium metal, a key feedstock in the production of butyllithium products in the U.S., the United Kingdom and China, as well as in the production of high purity lithium metal in the U.S. We have significant know-how and experience in lithium hydroxide, lithium carbonate, butyllithium and high purity lithium metal production processes and product applications, which we believe provide us with a competitive advantage in these markets. 
 Pending Rio Tinto Transaction 
 On October 9, 2024, Arcadium Lithium entered into the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement with Rio Tinto, which provides that pursuant to the Scheme under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, at the closing of the Rio Tinto Transaction, all of the ordinary shares, par value 1.00 per share, of the Company will be transferred from the shareholders of the Company to Rio Tinto in exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to 5.85 per ordinary share of the Company. 
 The closing of the Rio Tinto Transaction is subject to customary closing conditions under the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement, including, among others, receipt of regulatory approvals and Company Shareholder Approval. The Rio Tinto Transaction is currently expected to close in mid-2025, subject to satisfaction of the closing conditions. 
 If the Rio Tinto Transaction is consummated, the Company's ordinary shares will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and the Company s registration under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, will be terminated as promptly as practicable after the effective time of the Rio Tinto Transaction, and the quotation on the Australian Securities Exchange Ltd of the CHESS depositary interests issued by the Company will be suspended immediately prior to the effective time of the Rio Tinto Transaction. 
 The Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement contains certain termination rights for both the Company and Rio Tinto, including if the Rio Tinto Transaction is not completed on or before October 9, 2025, subject in certain circumstances to automatic extension in two three month increments to April 9, 2026 if certain regulatory approvals have not been obtained. The Rio Tinto Transaction

Agreement provides that, if the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement is terminated, the Company will pay a 200 million termination fee to Rio Tinto in the case of certain events described in the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement, including if the Company terminates the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement in connection with the Board of Directors of the Company changing its recommendation and if Rio Tinto terminates the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement due to the Board of Directors of the Company changing its recommendation. The termination fee may also become payable by the Company if the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances and the Company enters into an agreement for an alternative transaction within twelve months of such termination. See Note 1 for details. 
 The foregoing summary of the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement and the Rio Tinto Transaction contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms and conditions of the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 to this Form 10-Q. 
 Mt Cattlin site placed into care and maintenance 
 On September 4, 2024, Arcadium Lithium announced that it will suspend Stage 4A waste stripping, and any expansionary investment beyond Stage 3, at its Mt Cattlin spodumene operation in Western Australia given the decline in spodumene prices. As a result, the Company plans to place the Mt Cattlin site into care and maintenance by the end of the first half of 2025 after it completes Stage 3 mining and ore processing. The Company does not intend to close Mt Cattlin. Care and maintenance will keep the mine and processing facilities in a position to potentially resume operations when market conditions become more favorable. The Company will also continue to explore the viability of underground mining at the Mt Cattlin site, which could potentially extend the remaining mine life. 
 In the third quarter of 2024, as a result of the plan to place Mt Cattlin into care and maintenance, the Company determined that there were indicators of impairment and upon evaluation using the income approach, the Company determined the undiscounted cash flows of Mt Cattlin's assets were not greater than their carrying value, resulting in a non-cash charge of 51.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, recorded to Impairment charges in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. See Note 10 for details. 
 Capital spending and capacity expansions 
 In response to current lithium market conditions, the Company decided to defer investment in two of its four current expansion projects. The Company still sees a strong long-term growth trajectory for lithium demand and is committed to developing its portfolio of expansion opportunities on a timeline that is supported by the market and customers. 
 Arcadium Lithium intends to pause current investment in its 40,000 metric ton lithium carbonate equivalent ("LCE") spodumene Galaxy project in Canada (formerly "James Bay"). The pause in spending will be structured to minimize both cost and timing disruption when the project is ultimately resumed. The Nemaska Lithium Project continues to be progressed. 
 Additionally, Arcadium Lithium has adjusted the sequencing of its combined 25,000 metric ton lithium carbonate projects at the Salar del Hombre Muerto in Argentina. Rather than execute F nix Phase 1B and Sal de Vida Stage 1 simultaneously as previously announced, the projects will now be completed sequentially with Sal de Vida Stage 1 expected to be finished first. 
 As part of the ongoing production start-up at Olaroz Stage 2, a 25,000 metric ton lithium carbonate expansion in Argentina, the Company has identified and is evaluating the potential need for further capital in order to address production quality and reliability. 
 Li-Metal transaction 
 On August 2, 2024, Arcadium announced it acquired the lithium metal division of Li-Metal Corp. The all-cash 11 million USD transaction includes the intellectual property and physical assets related to lithium metal production, including a pilot production facility in Ontario, Canada. 
 Arcadium Lithium uses lithium metal to manufacture specialty products, including high purity lithium metal ("HPM") and LIOVIX , a proprietary printable lithium metal formulation, for primary battery applications and next-generation batteries. Arcadium Lithium also processes lithium metal into butyllithium, as well as other lithium specialty chemicals used in medicine, agriculture, electronics and other industries. 
 Merger of Allkem and Livent 
 On January 4, 2024, Arcadium Lithium completed the Allkem Livent Merger. 
 In this Form 10-Q, because Arcadium Lithium plc is the successor company to Livent in the Allkem Livent Merger which closed on January 4, 2024, we are presenting the results of predecessor Livent s operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and as of December 31, 2023, which do not include the financial position or operations of Allkem. Subsequent to the closing of the Allkem Livent Merger on January 4, 2024, the financial statements of the Company presented 
 48 

in this Form 10-Q include the financial position and operations of Allkem. As a result of the Allkem Livent Merger, our financial information for the reporting periods after January 4, 2024, which reflect the results of operations of Allkem, will not be directly comparable to our financial information for periods prior to the Allkem Livent Merger, including the information presented in this Form 10-Q. 
 Segment Information 
 In January 2024, Arcadium Lithium completed the Allkem Livent Merger. See Note 4, Allkem Livent Merger for further details. Following the closing of the Allkem Livent Merger, we currently operate as one reportable segment based on the commonalities among our products and services. As integration evolves, we will continue to assess this determination. 
 Business Update 
 Since the closing of the Allkem Livent Merger, we have been focused on safely integrating the operations of the legacy Allkem and Livent businesses and identifying and executing on cost savings, commercial and operational synergies. This includes rationalizing office space and employee organizational structures. We are making improvements to our capital management system and process, which we believe will result in more efficient and timely capital spending decisions and outlays. Broadly, we are attempting to have our expansion activities be supported by the cash generated from our operations over time, although that may not be possible in the short-term. We continue to harmonize different processes and reporting standards between the legacy Allkem and Livent businesses, including those used for accounting and reporting mineral resources and reserves. 
 We have had many years of reliable lithium production in Argentina. Nevertheless, our operations in Argentina are subject to their own unique challenges. Foreign currency reserves in Argentina remain depleted. Although the monthly rate of inflation has slowed, Argentina continues to be a highly inflationary economy with an unstable currency. It is marked by high natural gas, oil and power prices, and social, labor and political unrest. There is also financial uncertainty over the Argentina government's ability to repay large international debt obligations that are maturing in the future. Difficulties with foreign currency reserves have led to significant restrictions on foreign exchange transactions, which in turn have placed limits on imports, including certain materials for our operations and expansion projects. Additionally, vendor concerns regarding high inflation and the inability to restock items has resulted in increased pricing uncertainty with respect to products and equipment. 
 As a result of this mix of factors in Argentina, there is increasing interest and focus from federal, provincial and municipal governments to obtain additional sources of funding, such as through customs, royalties, tax revenues and other concessions from private and/or foreign companies, including from the lithium industry. The State Prosecutor of Salta notified us of its decision to terminate the suspension agreement with respect to the Salta Royalty Claim (as previously disclosed in Part I, Item 2, Properties, Material Individual Properties, Salar del Hombre Muerto, Mineral Concession Rights and Royalties of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K) with effect as from August 9, 2024. As a result, the underlying judicial claims resumed on August 10, 2024. Our discussions with the respective Provinces of Catamarca and Salta to resolve the Salta Royalty Claim are ongoing. There can be no assurance as to the outcome or timing of our discussions. 
 In addition, on June 27, 2024, the National Congress in Argentina approved the Bases and Starting Point of the Freedom of Argentines Law No. 27,742 (Ley de Bases y Puntos de Partida para la Libertad de los Argentinos) which, in addition to amending several existing laws, created the Incentive Regime for Large Investments ("RIGI", its acronym in Spanish). This statute became effective on July 8, 2024. The RIGI is a promotional regime that is applicable to the mining sector and provides guarantees of regulatory, fiscal, customs, and exchange rate stability to projects that qualify under it for a term of 30 years from the inclusion date. On August 23, 2024, the National Government issued Decree No. 749 that approved the regulation of RIGI. However, the implementation of certain aspects of RIGI is subject to the issuance of further regulations. The Provinces of Jujuy (through Law No 6409 published in its official gazette on August 14, 2024), Salta (through Law No. 8451 published in its official gazette on September 19, 2024) and Catamarca (through Law 5863 published in its official gazette on September 27, 2024) have agreed to adhere to RIGI. The Company is currently conducting an analysis to determine the scope and application of RIGI to its own operations. 
 On June 27, 2024, the National Congress in Argentina also approved the Law No. 27,743 on Palliative and Relevant Tax Measures which, among other things, increased the cap on mining royalties payable to the provinces from three percent (3 to five percent (5 of the pithead value of the extracted mineral. This new 5 cap on royalties applies exclusively to mining projects that have not started construction (i.e., being at or prior to the exploitation stage) prior to the date of entry into force of this law. As such, this should not apply to our ongoing operations and expansion projects in Argentina that are being managed and developed by our subsidiaries MdA, SDV and SDJ. The Province of Salta implemented this new law through Provincial Law No. 8,448, published in its official gazette on September 19, 2024. 
 In Argentina and Canada, we are currently focused on integrating and streamlining the different operations of Livent and Allkem both from a cost and production efficiency perspective. Our expansion efforts (now paused and modified as noted under 
 49 

"Capital spending and capacity expansions" above) progressed at a slower pace and at higher costs than originally contemplated. We are aligning our expansion efforts to match market conditions, supply chain challenges, and local labor market capabilities. Nevertheless, we intend to deliver additional volumes needed by customers within their requested timeframes. We do not expect our current expansion efforts in Argentina to be affected by the comprehensive and cumulative environmental study to be carried out by the Province of Catamarca, as ordered by the Provincial Supreme Court of Justice, that takes into account the cumulative effect of all projects in the area. Management is continuing to monitor the cumulative impact of neighboring projects, easement and tenement claims in Argentina on our water and brine rights, existing easements, and operations. There is little legal precedent and a limited government track record on the allocation of competing rights over fluid resources such as lithium brine and water in Argentina. Management is also monitoring our levels of water use in comparison to our local competitors. 
 Generally, the global economy and business environment in the diverse group of markets we serve present us with various opportunities and challenges. The long-term demand for lithium products remains strong, driven by the increased adoption of EVs and other energy storage applications, providing us with the opportunity to continue to develop high performance lithium compound products and maintain our position as a leading global producer of butyllithium and high purity lithium metal. However, the current lithium market is characterized by overcapacity and overproduction, a slower rate of demand growth than in the recent past, strong competition, vertical integration by end users, geopolitical tensions over supply chains, and certain macroeconomic headwinds, resulting in lower pricing. Nevertheless, we believe our business fundamentals are sound and that we can manage the impact on our business of fluctuating lithium prices, inflation, high energy costs and shortages, supply chain disruptions, various global conflicts and regional challenges, higher interest rates, the strength of the U.S. dollar, and the corresponding weakening of foreign currencies. Given our extensive global capabilities, vast experience in the markets we serve, and deep customer relationships, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on future business opportunities and the accelerating trend of electrification. 
 Customers in the EV manufacturing industry are positioning their businesses for continued expected growth in electrification, although at different rates around the globe. During the first three quarters of 2024, China EV adoption as evidenced by new car sales was at record levels, and battery installations exceeded many analysts expectations. In China, lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cathode-based batteries and plug-in electric hybrid vehicles (PHEVs) have increased their share in the chemistry and EV mix in recent quarters. EV sales in the European Union and the United States were below analysts' expectations during the first three quarters of 2024, but automakers expect to launch new attractive EV models during the fourth quarter of 2024 and in 2025, and expect support from lower battery prices. Globally, EV price reductions, particularly those of a few leading automakers, will likely continue to put commercial and financial pressures on several other automakers in the world's major EV markets. The rate of transition to electric drivetrains varies across automakers with several of them recently withdrawing their prior targets related to electrification, whereas others are fully committed to their prior electrification plans. 
 To support rising battery demand for EV and stationary storage applications in the future, cell manufacturers, cathode producers and lithium chemicals producers are adding capacity in different geographies and at different rates. The customer qualification and ramp-up of these cell, cathode, and lithium chemical lines, as well as inventory in the supply chain will in turn determine overall lithium consumption. Upstream battery raw material resource development typically takes longer than capacity additions in midstream and downstream parts of the supply chain. All of these variables may continue to add volatility and uncertainty to the overall EV and battery supply chains that may impact our business. This could cause delays in our customers' demand for our high-performance lithium compounds, adversely impacting our business and growth plans. 
 The material matters that management is currently monitoring are: the closing of the Rio Tinto Transaction, continued integration activities related to the Allkem Livent Merger, costs and the pace and scope of our ongoing expansion projects and those that we decide to pause; political and economic developments in Argentina, the United States, England and other places where we do business (especially the November elections in the United States, and any resulting government policy changes); the supply and demand balance of battery-grade and total lithium compounds in the global marketplace; lithium market prices and the impact currently lower market prices may have on earnings and investment opportunities; our marginal costs of production; inflation, interest rates and fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, and the negative impact they may have on our operations, customers (and their attempts at vertical integration and/or preferences for suppliers) and key end markets such as electric vehicles; global supply chain and logistics issues, and our ability to deliver products and receive key inputs; the impact of the IRA on the Company and customer demand; global energy supply concerns and prices; the potential economic and geopolitical consequences of various global conflicts; the pricing, economic demand and geopolitical impact of tariffs in the United States, Europe and elsewhere on EVs and other products; the effects of climate change, including climate events such as wildfires, droughts and rain near or impacting our operations, insurance premiums, and ESG compliance costs and reporting requirements; community relations near our operations; and, the potential for cybersecurity breaches.

2024 Business Outlook 
 For the combined business, we expect increased volumes sold versus the prior year, excluding Mt. Cattlin, driven by the ramp up of new production capacity in the second half of the year. This results in higher lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide sales, which is offset by lower spodumene concentrate sales due to reduced production at Mt. Cattlin in 2024. Our outlook for the remainder of 2024 depends to a significant extent on the market prices of our lithium products, which declined substantially in the fourth quarter of 2023, remain below the full 2023 fiscal year average and have declined further recently. This uncertainty is reduced in part by pricing mechanisms on a portion of our existing volumes under commercial agreements. We also expect increased costs versus the prior year, with higher costs from the ramping up of new production units offset by synergy and cost saving initiatives.

 In addition to net income attributable to Arcadium Lithium plc, as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we evaluate operating performance using certain Non-GAAP measures such as EBITDA, which we define as net income attributable to Arcadium Lithium plc plus noncontrolling interests, interest expense/(income), net, income tax (benefit)/expense, and depreciation and amortization; and Adjusted EBITDA, which we define as EBITDA adjusted for Argentina remeasurement losses/(gains), impairment charges, restructuring and other charges, Allkem Livent Merger inventory-related step-up, nonrecurring Blue Chip Swap gains and other losses/(gains). Management believes the use of these Non-GAAP measures allows management and investors to compare more easily the financial performance of its underlying business from period to period. The Non-GAAP information provided may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies because of differing methods used by other companies in calculating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. These measures should not be considered as a substitute for net income or other measures of performance or liquidity reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following table reconciles EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA from net income attributable to Arcadium Lithium plc.

 1. Represents the results of predecessor Livent s operations for three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and as of December 31, 2023, which do not include the financial position or operations of Allkem. 
 a. Represents impact of currency fluctuations primarily on deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Also includes impact of currency fluctuations on other tax assets and liabilities and on long-term monetary assets associated with our capital expansion as well as foreign currency devaluations. The remeasurement losses/(gains) are included within Other (gains)/losses in our condensed consolidated statements of operations but are excluded from our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA because of: i.) their nature as income tax related; ii.) their association with long-term capital projects which will not be operational until future periods; or iii.) the severity of the devaluations and their immediate impact on our operations in the country. 
 b. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company's plan to place its Mt Cattlin spodumene operation in Western Australia into care and maintenance resulted in a non-cash charge of 51.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and was recorded to Impairment charges in the condensed consolidated statement of operations (see Note 10 for more information). The impairment charges are excluded from our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA because the charges are nonrecurring. 
 c. We continually perform strategic reviews and assess the return on our business. This sometimes results in management changes or in a plan to restructure the operations of our business. As part of these restructuring plans, demolition costs and write-downs of long-lived assets may occur. The three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 include costs related to the Allkem Livent Merger of 12.2 million and 13.6 million, respectively. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 include costs related to the Allkem Livent Merger of 99.0 million and 32.3 million, respectively. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 includes severance-related costs of 14.7 million and 2.4 million, respectively (see Note 11 for more information). 
 d. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes a 0.9 million prepayment fee incurred when the Sal de Vida Project Financing Facility was repaid in its entirety by SDJ on May 30, 2024 and 0.2 million for the partial write-off of deferred financing costs for amendments to the Revolving Credit Facility. The debt extinguishment losses are excluded from our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA because the loss is nonrecurring. 
 e. Relates to the step-up in inventory recorded for Allkem Livent Merger for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of purchase accounting, excluded from Adjusted EBITDA as the step-up is considered a one-time, non-recurring cost. 
 f. The three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily represents foreign currency remeasurement gains related to U.S. dollar-denominated cash balances temporarily held at a foreign currency-functional subsidiary. The three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, prior to consolidation of Nemaska Lithium Inc. ("NLI") on October 18, 2023, represents our 50 ownership interest in costs incurred for certain project-related costs to align NLI's reported results with Arcadium's capitalization policies and interest expense incurred by NLI, all included in Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliate in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company consolidates NLI on a one-quarter lag basis and prior to October 18, 2023, accounted for its equity method investment in NLI on a one-quarter lag basis (see Note 9 for more information). 
 g. Represents non-recurring gain from the sale in Argentina pesos of Argentina Sovereign U.S. dollar-denominated bonds due to the divergence of Argentina's Blue Chip Swap market exchange rate from the official rate. 
 h. Represents interest income received from the Argentina government for the period beginning when the recoverability of certain of our expansion-related VAT receivables were approved by the Argentina government and ending on the date when the reimbursements were 
 53 

paid by the Argentina government but is excluded from our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA because of its association with long-term capital projects which will not be operational until future periods. 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenue 
 Revenue of 203.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 (the "2024 Quarter") decreased by approximately 4 , or 8.3 million, compared to 211.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 (the "2023 Quarter") primarily due to lower volumes of lithium hydroxide of 10.6 million as well as lower pricing across all legacy Livent products of 54.3 million, partially offset by revenues contributed by Allkem post-merger of 56.6 million. 
 Gross margin 
 Gross margin of 56.2 million for the 2024 Quarter decreased by 71.6 million, or approximately 56.0 , versus 127.8 million for the 2023 Quarter. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to the impact of lower pricing across all legacy Livent products of 54.3 million and higher operating costs of 11.5 million as well as lower volumes of 2.8 million primarily driven by lithium hydroxide and the impact from Allkem post-merger gross margin loss of 3.1 million. 
 Impairment charges 
 Impairment charges of 51.7 million for the 2024 Quarter were due to the impairment of long-lived assets resulting from the plan by the Company to place the Mt Cattlin spodumene operation into care and maintenance by the end of the first half of 2025 after it completes Stage 3 mining and ore processing. See Note 10 for details. No impairment charges were recorded in the 2023 Quarter. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses of 39.7 million for the 2024 Quarter increased by 26.5 million, or approximately 201 versus 13.2 million for the 2023 Quarter. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to Allkem post merger costs of 17.6 million as well as 4.9 million related to consolidation of Nemaska Lithium on a one-quarter lag basis in the 2024 Quarter. 
 Restructuring and other charges 
 Restructuring and other charges of 9.7 million for the 2024 Quarter increased by 1.0 million versus 8.7 million for the 2023 Quarter. Restructuring and other charges for the 2024 Quarter primarily consisted of 12.2 million of costs related to the Allkem Livent Merger, and 0.6 million severance-related charges. 2023 Quarter Restructuring and other charges consisted primarily of costs related to the Allkem Livent Merger of 13.6 million and the Bessemer City plant fire insurance recovery gain of 5.0 million (see Note 11 for details). 
 Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliate 
 Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliate of 5.9 million for the 2024 Quarter arises out of our economic interest in TLC, which operates the Naraha plant and is accounted for as an equity method investment. Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliate of 6.7 million for the 2023 Quarter arises out of our ownership interest in the Nemaska Lithium Project, which is 50 and was accounted for as an equity method investment for the 2023 Quarter representing Arcadium's 50 share of project-related costs incurred by the Nemaska Lithium Project for continuing construction of the lithium hydroxide conversion plant in B cancour, Qu bec (see Note 9 for details). Nemaska Lithium was consolidated on a one-quarter lag basis for the 2024 Quarter. 
 Income tax (benefit)/expense 
 The increase in income tax benefit to 33.4 million for the 2024 Quarter resulting in an effective tax rate of 383.9 compared to the income tax expense of 9.3 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 9.6 for the 2023 Quarter, was primarily due to a decrease in pretax income from operations. Additionally, a tax benefit of 15.5 million was recorded on the impairment charge for the Mt. Cattlin spodumene operation in the 2024 Quarter. See Note 10 for details. The income tax benefit recorded due to fluctuations in foreign currency impacts in Argentina was similar for the 2024 Quarter and the 2023 Quarter. A benefit of 11.1 million was recorded for the 2024 Quarter, compared to 11.5 million for the 2023 Quarter. 
 Net income 
 Net income of 24.7 million for the 2024 Quarter decreased 62.7 million, or approximately 71.7 , versus 87.4 million for the 2023 Quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower gross margin of 71.6 million, impairment charges in the 2024 Quarter of 51.7 million and higher selling general and administrative expenses of 26.5 million, partially offset primarily by 
 54 

foreign currency remeasurement gains, gains from our sale of Argentina Sovereign U.S. dollar-denominated bonds, and an income tax benefit in the 2024 Quarter. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Adjusted EBITDA of 42.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 76.7 million, compared to 119.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the impact of lower pricing across all legacy Livent products of 54.3 million and higher operating costs of 3.1 million excluding depreciation as well as lower volumes of 2.8 million primarily driven by lithium hydroxide and the impact from Allkem post-merger loss of 14.0 million. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenue 
 Revenue of 718.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (the "2024 YTD") increased by approximately 2.6 , or 18.1 million, compared to 700.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 (the "2023 YTD") primarily due to revenues contributed by Allkem post-merger of 242.9 million, partially offset by lower pricing across all legacy Livent products of 213.1 million and lower volumes of 11.7 million primarily driven by lithium hydroxide volumes. 
 Gross margin 
 Gross margin of 243.0 million for the 2024 YTD decreased by 199.3 million, or approximately 45 , versus 442.3 million for the 2023 YTD. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to the impact of lower pricing across all legacy Livent products of 213.1 million as well as higher operating costs of 33.1 million, partially offset by volumes mix of 6.4 million and impact from Allkem post-merger of 40.4 million. 
 Impairment charges 
 Impairment charges of 51.7 million for the 2024 YTD were due to the impairment of long-lived assets resulting from the plan by the Company to place the Mt Cattlin spodumene operation into care and maintenance by the end of the first half of 2025 after it completes Stage 3 mining and ore processing. See Note 10 for details. No impairment charges were recorded in the 2023 YTD. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses of 95.1 million for the 2024 YTD increased by 48.0 million, or approximately 101.9 versus 47.1 million for the 2023 YTD. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to impact from Allkem post-merger of 35.4 million and 13.2 million related to consolidation of Nemaska Lithium on a one-quarter lag basis in the 2024 Quarter. 
 Restructuring and other charges 
 Restructuring and other charges of 111.4 million for the 2024 YTD increased by 76.4 million versus 35.0 million for the 2023 YTD. Restructuring and other charges for the 2024 YTD primarily consisted of 99.0 million of costs related to the Allkem Livent Merger, and 14.7 million severance related charges. 2023 YTD Restructuring and other charges consisted primarily of costs related to the Allkem Livent Merger of 32.3 million and the Bessemer City plant fire insurance recovery gain of 5.0 million (see Note 11 for details). 
 Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliate 
 Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliate of 5.9 million for the 2024 YTD arises out of our economic interest in TLC, which operates the Naraha plant and is accounted for as an equity method investment. Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliate of 22.0 million for the 2023 YTD arises out of our ownership interest in the Nemaska Lithium Project, which is 50 and was accounted for as an equity method investment for the 2023 YTD, representing Arcadium's 50 share of project-related costs incurred by the Nemaska Lithium Project for continuing construction of the lithium hydroxide conversion plant in B cancour, Qu bec (see Note 9 for details). Nemaska Lithium was consolidated on a one-quarter lag basis for the 2024 YTD. 
 Income tax expense 
 The income tax expense for the 2024 YTD is 55.7 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 28.6 , compared to the income tax expense of 47.8 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 14.1 for the 2023 YTD. The income tax expense increased for the 2024 YTD due to an increase in fluctuations in foreign currency impacts in Argentina of 113.4 million and (12.0) million for the 2024 YTD and 2023 YTD, respectively. In addition, the increase in income tax expense is due to changes in forecasted jurisdictional mix of earnings where the statutory rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate. The increase in income tax expense was offset by the impact of the decrease in income from operations, along with changes in 
 55 

valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets in Argentina of (77.2) million, primarily relating to the fluctuations in foreign currency impacts in Argentina. Additionally, a tax benefit of 15.5 million was recorded on the impairment charge for the Mt. Cattlin spodumene operation in the 2024 YTD. See Note 10 for details. 
 Net income 
 Net income of 139.1 million for the 2024 YTD decreased 153.3 million, or approximately 52 , versus 292.4 million for the 2023 YTD. The decrease was primarily due to lower gross margin of 199.3 million, higher Restructuring and other charges of 76.4 million and higher selling general and administrative expenses of 48.0 million, partially offset by foreign currency remeasurement gains and gain from our sale of Argentina Sovereign U.S. dollar-denominated bonds, interest income, net in the 2024 YTD and 22.0 million equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliate in the 2023 YTD compared to 5.9 million in the 2024 YTD. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Adjusted EBITDA of 250.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 160.7 million, compared to 411.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower revenues due to lower pricing of 213.1 million across all legacy Livent products and higher cost of 15.2 million excluding depreciation, partially offset by favorable volumes mix of 6.4 million and the impact from Allkem post-merger contribution of 61.1 million. 
 56 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Our prospective success in funding our cash needs will depend on the strength of the lithium market and our continued ability to generate cash from operations and raise capital from other sources. Our primary sources of cash are currently generated from operations and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. Pursuant to the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement, while the Rio Tinto Transaction is pending, we are restricted or prohibited from certain non-ordinary course capital expenditures without the consent of Rio Tinto. Additionally, during that same time, we are subject to various restrictions under the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement on raising additional capital, issuing additional equity or debt, and pursuing certain activities that could use significant amounts of our liquidity, including assuming or incurring additional debt, repurchasing equity, and entering into certain acquisition and disposition transactions, among other restrictions without the consent of Rio Tinto, which is not to be unreasonably withheld. We are permitted to continue to borrow under our Revolving Credit Facility, under existing project financing arrangements, and in connection with letters of credit entered into in the ordinary course of business. Rio Tinto has agreed to cooperate with the Company to facilitate any necessary or appropriate actions and arrangements with respect to the Company's indebtedness in anticipation of the Rio Tinto Transaction, including potentially providing new financing or otherwise. 
 Arcadium's cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, were 137.9 million and 237.6 million, respectively. The balance as of December 31, 2023 represents only predecessor Livent cash and cash equivalents. Of the cash and cash equivalents balance as of September 30, 2024, 126.2 million were held by our foreign subsidiaries, including 84.6 million at partially-owned subsidiaries. The cash held by foreign subsidiaries for permanent reinvestment is generally used to finance the subsidiaries operating activities and future foreign investments. We have not provided additional income taxes for any additional outside basis differences inherent in our investments in subsidiaries that are considered permanently reinvested. For those earnings that are not considered permanently reinvested, we have recorded the associated tax expense related to the repatriation of those earnings, where appropriate. See Note 11, Part II, Item 8 of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. 
 Statement of Cash Flows 
 Cash (used in)/provided by operating activities was (158.9) million and 261.8 million for the 2024 YTD and 2023 YTD, respectively. 
 The decrease from cash used in operating activities for the 2024 YTD as compared to the cash provided by operating activities for the 2023 YTD was primarily driven by a decrease in net income, an increase in inventories and an increase in cash tax payments for income taxes, net of refunds. 
 Cash used in investing activities was 129.8 million and 315.5 million for the 2024 YTD and 2023 YTD, respectively. 
 The decrease in cash used in investing activities for the 2024 YTD compared to the 2023 YTD is primarily due to the 682 million cash acquired in the Allkem Livent Merger and 64.9 million in net cash proceeds from the Blue Chip Swap trades in 2024 YTD compared to 21.4 million for the 2023 YTD, partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures due to the consolidation of Nemaska Lithium and increased spend on expansion projects due to the Allkem Livent Merger in the 2024 YTD. 
 Cash provided by/(used in) financing activities was 203.1 million and (21.5) million for the 2024 YTD and 2023 YTD, respectively. 
 The increase from cash provided by financing activities for the 2024 YTD compared to cash used in financing activities for the 2023 YTD is primarily due to the receipt of a customer prepayment of 150 million related to the Nemaska customer supply agreement (see Note 9 for details), an increase in net proceeds from the Company's Revolving Credit Facility of 99 million in 2024 YTD and cash contributions of 39.1 million from the noncontrolling interest in Nemaska Lithium, on a one-quarter lag, in 2024 YTD (see Note 9 for details), partially offset by 83.2 million for repayment of the SDV Project Financing Facility in its entirety and partial repayment of the Olaroz Plant Project Loan Facility in 2024 YTD and the net impact of a 21.7 million payment of deposit to Argentina Customs Authorities in 2023 YTD. 
 Other potential liquidity needs 
 We plan to meet our liquidity needs, including those related to the consummation of the Rio Tinto Transaction, through available cash, cash generated from operations, borrowings under the committed Revolving Credit Facility, and other potential financing strategies that may be available to us. Broadly, we are attempting to have our expansion activities be supported by the cash generated from our operations over time, although this may not be possible in the short-term, particularly in light of current lithium pricing. We have decided to reduce our capital spending plan to better align it with our anticipated cash generation. See "Capital spending and capacity expansions" for additional detail. As of September 30, 2024, our remaining borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility, subject to meeting our debt covenants, is 380.3 million, including letters of credit utilization. 
 57 

We repaid the 9.1 million outstanding principal balance on Stage 1 of the Olaroz Plan Project Loan Facility in its entirety in the third quarter of 2024. We repaid the 47.0 million outstanding principal balance of the SDV Project Financing Facility in the second quarter of 2024. 
 Our net leverage ratio under our Revolving Credit Facility is determined, in large part, by our ability to manage the timing and amount of our capital expenditures, which is within our control. It is also determined by our ability to achieve forecasted operating results and to pursue other working capital financing strategies that may be available to us, which is less certain and outside our control. 
 There continue to be challenges relating to expansion projects impacting both Argentina and Canada, including design and timeline modifications, labor constraints, and material shortages due to supply chain issues. This has the potential to increase costs, extend delivery times versus expectations, and reduce expected merger synergies. 
 We will look to various sources of financing for development of the Nemaska Lithium Project, in which we have a 50 economic interest, including, but not limited to third-party debt financing, government funding, financing or prepayments from customers and contribution from existing shareholders. 
 We expect the potential economic and geopolitical consequences of various global conflicts, volatile energy costs and shortages, inflation, high interest rates, and currency fluctuations to continue in the second half of 2024. The Company remains focused on maintaining its financial flexibility and will continue to manage its cash flow and capital allocation decisions to navigate through this challenging environment. 
 We believe that our available cash and cash from operations, together with our borrowing availability under the Revolving Credit Facility and other potential financing strategies that may be available to us, will provide adequate liquidity for the next 12 months. Access to capital and the availability of financing on acceptable terms in the future will be affected by many factors, including our credit rating, economic conditions and the overall liquidity of capital markets and cannot be guaranteed. 
 The following table provides a reconciliation of Arcadium Lithium's Cash and cash equivalents (GAAP) to Adjusted cash and deposits (Non-GAAP), on an unaudited basis for illustrative purposes. We define Adjusted cash and deposits (Non-GAAP) as Cash and cash equivalents, plus restricted cash in Other non-current assets, less Nemaska Lithium Cash and cash equivalents consolidated by Arcadium on a one-quarter lag, plus Nemaska Lithium Cash and cash equivalents not on a one-quarter lag. Our management believes that this measure provides useful information about the Company's balances and liquidity to investors and securities analysts. Such measure may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies because of differing methods used by other companies in calculating Adjusted cash and deposits. These measures should not be considered as a substitute for Cash and cash equivalents or other measures of liquidity reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

 ______________ 
 1. This unaudited information of the combined company as of December 31, 2023 is for illustrative purposes and was derived from the historical consolidated financial information of Livent, Allkem and Nemaska Lithium. 
 2. On May 30, 2024, SDV paid the outstanding principal balance of 47.0 million, a prepayment fee of 0.9 million and accrued interest and commitment fees of 1.3 million to repay the Project Financing Facility in its entirety. 
 3. The presentation reflects NLI's actual balance at that date, not on a one-quarter lag. This differs from Nemaska Lithium cash and 
 58 

cash equivalents included in Arcadium Lithium's condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 of 42 million, representing NLI's balance as of June 30, 2024 as we consolidate NLI on a one-quarter lag. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company contributed cash of 43.9 million to Nemaska Lithium which, due to one-quarter lag reporting, is not yet recorded in our consolidation of Nemaska. The balance is recorded to Other assets - noncurrent because the cash is expected to be used by Nemaska primarily for capital expenditures. IQ contemporaneously made an equal contribution in the third quarter of 2024 which, due to one-quarter lag reporting, is not recorded in our consolidation of Nemaska. See Note 9 for details. On March 28, 2024, Nemaska Lithium received cash of 150 million related to a second advance payment in connection with a customer supply agreement repayable in equal quarterly installments beginning in January 2027 and ending in October 2031. 
 4. 124.6 million and 176.9 million is required to be reserved or restricted at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, to provide collateral or cash backing for guarantees primarily on Allkem debt facilities, including 23.3 million and 62.1 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, in Other non-current assets in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. See Note 15 for details. 
 Commitments and Contingencies 
 See Note 20 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments 
 Information related to predecessor Livent contractual commitments as of December 31, 2023 can be found in a table included within Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations within our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Arcadium's significant commitments assumed on the Acquisition Date related to the Allkem Livent Merger include payments of 1.3 million for the remainder of 2024 and 0.9 million for each of the years 2025 through 2028 for exploration and payments of 4.9 million, 13.0 million, 12.6 million and 5.8 million for raw materials and other operating contracts in the ordinary course of business for the remainder of 2024, 2025, 2026 and 2027, respectively. 
 Climate Change 
 A detailed discussion related to climate change can be found in Part II, Item 7 of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 In addition to those described in Item 7 of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have identified "Resources", "Inventory", "Depreciation and amortization" and "Goodwill" as Critical Accounting Estimates following the Allkem Livent Merger. 
 Resources 
 We report resources in accordance with the SEC's definition set forth in Subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K. As such, our resources are the concentration or occurrence of lithium in such form, grade or quality, and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for economic extraction. Our mineral resource estimates provide a reasonable estimate of mineralization, taking into account relevant factors such as cut-off grade, likely mining dimensions, location or continuity, that, with the assumed and justifiable technical and economic conditions, is likely to, in whole or in part, become economically extractable. The determination of resources includes estimates and assumptions about a range of geological, technical and economic factors, including: quantities, grades, production techniques, recovery rates, production costs, transport costs, commodity demand, commodity prices and exchange rates. Changes in resources impact the assessment of recoverability of exploration and evaluation assets, property, plant and equipment, the carrying amount of assets depreciated on a units of production basis, provision for site restoration and the recognition of deferred tax assets, including tax losses. Estimating the quantity and/or grade of resources requires the size, shape and depth of ore or brine bodies to be determined by analyzing geological data. This process requires complex and difficult geological judgements to interpret the data. Additional information on the Arcadium s reserves and resources are found in Item 2, Mineral Properties, of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Estimates of resources may change from period to period as the economic assumptions used to estimate resource change and additional geological data is generated during the course of operations. Changes in resources may affect the Company s financial results and financial position in a number of ways, including: 
 asset carrying values may be affected due to changes in estimated future production levels, 
 depreciation, depletion and amortization charged in the statement of operations may change where such charges are determined on the units of production basis, or where the useful economic lives of assets change, 
 59 

decommissioning, site restoration and environmental provisions may change where changes in estimated resources affect expectations about the timing or cost of these activities, 
 the carrying amount of deferred tax assets may change due to changes in estimates of the likely recovery of the tax benefits. 
 Inventory 
 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Determination of the brine pond volumes and spodumene stockpiles is based on surveys, assays and technical studies using industry, engineering and scientific data. A degree of judgment is involved in determining assumptions and estimates. 
 Depreciation and amortization 
 Costs incurred to develop new properties are capitalized as incurred where the property can be economically developed based on proven and probable reserves. For properties which employ surface mining techniques, this includes the costs to delineate ore bodies and remove over burden to initially expose the ore body prior to the commencement of commercial production. After the commencement of commercial production, costs of major mine development that benefit the entire ore body are capitalized and amortized over the proven and probable reserves of the entire ore body. If costs relate to access specific pits, they are capitalized and amortized over the proven and probable reserves specific to that pit. 
 The calculation of the units of production rate of amortization could be impacted if actual production in the future is different from current production forecast based on proven and probable reserves. This may occur if there were significant changes in the reserves driven by changes in commodity price assumptions, production costs, ore grades, foreign currency exchange rates and potential expansion of the reserves and resources through exploration activities. If reserves increased, the amortization charge per unit would decrease and if reserves decreased the amortization charge per unit would increase. 
 Impairments and valuation of long-lived assets and equity method investments 
 Our long-lived assets primarily include property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. We periodically evaluate whether events or circumstances ("triggering events") indicate that the net book value of our property, plant and equipment may not be recoverable. In addition, we periodically evaluate if facts and circumstances indicate that a decrease in value of our equity method investments has occurred that is other than temporary. We exercise significant judgment in performing these evaluations, considering factors such as general market outlooks, company-specific historical results as well as future forecasts for production, operating income and cash flows. 
 In the third quarter of 2024, as a result of the plan to place Mt Cattlin spodumene operations into care and maintenance, the Company determined that there were indicators of impairment and upon evaluation using the income approach, the Company determined the undiscounted cash flows of Mt Cattlin's assets were not greater than their carrying value, resulting in a non-cash charge of 51.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, recorded to Impairment charges in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. See Note 10 for details. 
 Goodwill 
 We account for goodwill acquired in a business combination in conformity with current accounting guidance, which requires goodwill not be amortized. 
 Under that guidance, goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of reporting units to the related carrying value. Reporting units are either operating business segment or one level below operating business segments for which discrete financial information is available and for which operating results are regularly reviewed by the business management. Judgment is required to determine reporting units. In applying the goodwill impairment test, a qualitative test ("Step 0") is initially performed, where qualitative factors are first assessed to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance of the reporting units and other entity and reporting unit specific events. If after assessing these qualitative factors it is "more-likely-than-not" that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a quantitative test ("Step 1") is performed. During Step 1, the fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. Future cash flows for all reporting units include assumptions about revenue growth rates, adjusted EBITDA margins, discount rate as well as other economic or industry-related factors. Significant management judgment is involved in estimating these variables and they include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events. The Company tests its recorded goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of its reporting units below their carrying amounts.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND MARKET RISKS 
 Our earnings, cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Our policy is to minimize exposure to our cash flow over time caused by changes in interest and currency exchange rates. To accomplish this, we have implemented a controlled program of risk management consisting of appropriate derivative contracts entered into with major financial institutions. 
 The analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices. The range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one-year period. Market value estimates are based on the present value of projected future cash flows considering the market rates and prices chosen. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our net derivative financial instrument position was a net asset of 0.4 million. In the first half of 2024, we placed foreign currency hedges for 2024 projected exposure. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 Our worldwide operations expose us to currency risk from sales, purchases, expenses and intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our functional currency. The primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the Euro, the British pound, the Chinese yuan, the Argentine peso, the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar and the Japanese yen. Foreign currency debt and foreign exchange forward contracts are used in countries where we do business, thereby reducing our net asset exposure. Foreign exchange forward contracts are also used to hedge firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows. We currently do not hedge foreign currency risks associated with the Argentine peso due to the limited availability and the high cost of suitable derivative instruments. 
 To analyze the effects of changing foreign currency rates, we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels as of September 30, 2024 with all other variables (including interest rates) held constant. 
 Hedged Currency vs. Functional Currency (in Millions) Net asset position on condensed consolidated balance sheets Net liability position with 10 strengthening Net asset position with 10 weakening Net asset/(liability) position as of September 30, 2024 
 0.4 (0.7) 1.3 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 One of the strategies that we can use to manage interest rate exposure is to enter into interest rate swap agreements. In these agreements, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated on an agreed-upon notional principal amount. As of September 30, 2024, we had no material interest rate swap agreements. 
 Our debt portfolio as of September 30, 2024 is composed of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, consisting of borrowings under our 2025 Notes, Revolving Credit Facility and two project level debt facilities and eleven affiliate loans assumed in the Allkem Livent Merger. Changes in interest rates affect different portions of our variable-rate debt portfolio in different ways. As of September 30, 2024, we had 99.0 million in outstanding balances under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 Based on the variable-rate debt in our debt portfolio at September 30, 2024, a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates would have increased or decreased, respectively, gross interest expense by 0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 The information required by this item is provided in "Derivative Financial Instruments and Market Risks," under Item 2 - Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. Based on management s evaluation (with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer), the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 (b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Except as noted below, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Effective January 4, 2024, we completed the Allkem Livent Merger. We are in the process of integrating Allkem s processes and controls over financial reporting. In accordance with our integration efforts, we plan to incorporate Allkem s operations into our internal control over financial reporting program within the time provided by the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 We are involved in legal proceedings from time to time in the ordinary course of our business, including with respect to workers compensation matters. Based on information currently available and established reserves, we have no reason to believe that the ultimate resolution of any known legal proceeding will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity or results of operations. However, there can be no assurance that the outcome of any such legal proceeding will be favorable, and adverse results in certain of these legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations in any one reporting period, or liquidity. Except as set forth in Note 20 to our condensed consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated herein by reference to the extent applicable, there are no material changes from the legal proceedings previously disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is available at www.sec.gov and on our website at www.arcadiumlithium.com. Other than the risk factors set forth below, we do not believe that there have been material changes in the risk factors set forth in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results. 
 Risks Relating to the Rio Tinto Transaction : 
 The completion of the Rio Tinto Transaction contemplated by the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement is subject to a number of conditions, and the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms. As a result, the timing surrounding the closing of the Rio Tinto Transaction is uncertain and there is a risk that the Rio Tinto Transaction may not be completed. 
 On October 9, 2024, we entered into the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement with Rio Tinto. The Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement provides that pursuant to the Scheme under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, at the effective time, all of our ordinary shares, par value 1.00 per share (the "Company Shares"), including the Company Shares represented by CHESS depositary interests issued by us and listed on the securities exchange operated by ASX Limited, then outstanding will be transferred from our shareholders to Buyer (or an affiliate of Buyer designated by Buyer in accordance with the terms of the Scheme) in exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to 5.85 per Company Share. 
 The completion of the Rio Tinto Transaction is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions as set forth in the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement, including, among others: the approval of the Scheme by the our shareholders; all applicable governmental consents under specified antitrust and investment screening laws having been obtained and remaining in full force and effect and all applicable waiting periods having expired, lapsed or been terminated (as applicable); no governmental entity of a competent jurisdiction having issued any order that is in effect and restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits the consummation of the Rio Tinto Transaction and no governmental entity having jurisdiction over any party having adopted any law that is in effect and makes consummation of the Rio Tinto Transaction illegal or otherwise prohibited; the representations and warranties of each of the Company and Parent being true and correct to the extent required by, and subject to the applicable materiality standards set forth in, the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement; each of the Company, Parent and Buyer having in all material respects performed the obligations and complied with the covenants required to be performed or complied with by it under the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement; and there having been no material adverse effect (as defined in the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement). The timing surrounding whether these conditions will be satisfied or waived, if at all, is uncertain. Additionally, other events could intervene to delay or result in the failure to close the Rio Tinto Transaction. 
 If the Rio Tinto Transaction has not closed by October 9, 2025 (subject to extension until April 9, 2026 in order to obtain antitrust or investment screening law or other regulatory approvals), either we or Parent may choose to terminate the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement. However, this right to terminate the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement will not be available to us or Parent if such party has materially breached the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement and the breach is the principal cause of the failure of the closing to have occurred prior to such date. We or Parent may elect to terminate the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement in certain other circumstances, including if our shareholders fail to approve the Rio Tinto Transaction at the shareholder meeting, and we and Parent can mutually decide to terminate the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement at any time prior to the closing, before or after the required approval by our shareholders. 
 
 The termination of the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement could negatively impact us and, in certain circumstances, could require us to pay a termination fee to Rio Tinto. 
 63 

If the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms and the Rio Tinto Transaction is not completed, our ongoing business may be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities during the pendency of the Rio Tinto Transaction, the failure to obtain the anticipated benefits of completing the Rio Tinto Transaction, the payment of certain costs relating to the Rio Tinto Transaction and the focus of our management on the Rio Tinto Transaction for an extended period of time rather than on ongoing business matters or other opportunities or issues. Our stock price may fall as a result of any such termination, to the extent that the current price of our shares reflects a market assumption that the Rio Tinto Transaction will be completed (although this is difficult to predict with any certainty). In addition, the failure to complete the Rio Tinto Transaction may result in negative publicity or a negative impression of us in the investment community and may affect our relationship with employees, customers, suppliers, vendors and other partners. 
 We may be required to pay Rio Tinto a termination fee equal to 200 million if the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances specified in the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement relating to, among other things, if our board of directors changes its recommendation that our shareholders vote in favor of the Rio Tinto Transaction or if there is an intentional and material breach of certain provisions of the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement by us. Further, we will also be required to pay Rio Tinto the 200 million termination fee if the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances specified in the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement after we receive a competing transaction proposal, and, within 12 months after the date of termination, we enter into a definitive agreement with respect to, or consummate, a change of control transaction with any party. If the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement is terminated and we determine to seek another business combination or strategic opportunity, we may not be able to negotiate a transaction with another party on terms comparable to, or better than, the terms of the Rio Tinto Transaction. 
 The pendency of the Rio Tinto Transaction could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 The pendency of the Rio Tinto Transaction could cause disruptions in and create uncertainty surrounding our business, including by affecting our relationships with our existing and future customers, suppliers, vendors, partners, and employees, and our standing with local communities, regulators, and other government officials. This could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the market price of our shares, regardless of whether the Rio Tinto Transaction is completed. In particular, we could potentially lose important personnel who decide to pursue other opportunities as a result of the Rio Tinto Transaction. Any adverse effect could be exacerbated by a prolonged delay in completing the Rio Tinto Transaction. We could also potentially lose customers, suppliers or vendors, existing customers, suppliers or vendors may seek to change their existing business relationships or renegotiate their contracts with us or defer decisions concerning us and potential customers, suppliers, or vendors could defer entering into contracts with us, each as a result of uncertainty relating to the Rio Tinto Transaction. In addition, in an effort to complete the Rio Tinto Transaction, we have expended, and will continue to expend, significant management resources on matters relating to the Rio Tinto Transaction, which are being diverted from our day-to-day operations, and significant demands are being, and will continue to be, placed on our managerial, operational and financial personnel and systems in connection with efforts to complete the Rio Tinto Transaction. 
 While the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement is in effect, we are subject to restrictions on our conduct and business activities, which could adversely affect our business, financial results, financial condition or share price. 
 Under the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement, we are subject to a range of restrictions on the conduct of our business and generally must operate our business in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice prior to completing the Rio Tinto Transaction. These restrictions may constrain our ability to pursue certain business strategies. The restrictions may also prevent us from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities, making acquisitions and investments or making other changes to our business prior to the completion of the Rio Tinto Transaction or the termination of the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement. Any such lost opportunities may reduce our competitiveness or efficiency and could lead to an adverse effect on our business, financial results, financial condition or our share price. 
 The Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement contains restrictions on our ability to pursue alternatives to the Rio Titno Transaction, which may limit the value that our shareholders could receive from a transaction. 
 The Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement generally prohibits us, subject to certain exceptions, from initiating, soliciting, knowingly encouraging or otherwise knowingly facilitating any inquiries or the making of any contract, proposal, offer or indication of interest that constitute or would reasonably be expected to lead to any competing transaction proposal. 
 
 Further, subject to limited exceptions and consistent with applicable law, the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement probits our board of directors from changing, withholding, withdrawing, qualifying or modifying, in a manner adverse to the Parent, its recommendation that our shareholders approve the Rio Tinto Transaction and, in specified circumstances, the Parent and Buyer 
 64 

have a right to negotiate with us in order to match any competing transaction proposal that may be made. Although our board of directors is permitted to take certain actions in response to a superior transaction proposal or a competing transaction proposal that would reasonably be expected to result in a superior transaction proposal if it determines that the failure to do so would likely breach its statutory and fiduciary duties under applicable law, in specified situations, we may still be required to pay Rio Tinto a termination fee of 200 million. These provisions may limit our ability to pursue offers from third parties that could result in greater value to our shareholders than they would receive in the Rio Tinto Transaction. The 200 million termination fee may also discourage third parties from pursuing an acquisition proposal with respect to us. 
 There may be shareholder class actions or derivative actions, which could result in substantial costs and may delay or prevent the Rio Tinto Transaction from being completed. 
 Shareholder class action lawsuits or derivative lawsuits are often brought against companies that have entered into transaction agreements. Such litigation can be costly and time consuming and can create uncertainty. Even if the lawsuits are without merit, defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources. Additionally, if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting consummation of the Rio Tinto Transaction, then that injunction may delay or prevent the Rio Tinto Transaction from being completed. 
 One of the conditions to consummating the Rio Tinto Transaction is that no governmental entity has enacted any law or issued any order restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Rio Tinto Transaction. Consequently, if a party secures injunctive or other relief prohibiting, delaying or otherwise adversely affecting our, Parent s or Buyer s ability to complete the Rio Tinto Transaction on the terms contemplated by the Rio Tinto Transaction Agreement, then such law or injunctive or other relief may prevent consummation of the Rio Tinto Transaction in a timely manner or at all. These lawsuits also have the potential to negatively impact our reputation.
