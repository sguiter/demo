 The base management fee is calculated initially at an annual rate equal to of average invested assets (calculated as total assets excluding cash, which includes assets financed using leverage); provided, however, the base management fee is calculated at an annual rate equal to of the Company s average invested assets (calculated as total assets excluding cash, which includes assets financed using leverage) that exceeds the product of (i) and (ii) the Company s average net assets. For the avoidance of doubt, the is calculated in accordance with the asset coverage limitation as defined in the 1940 Act. This has the effect of reducing the Company s base management fee rate on assets in excess of regulatory leverage of :1 debt to equity to per annum. The base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears. 
 Base management fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were and , respectively. Base management fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were and , respectively. 
 The incentive fee consists of two parts. The first part is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears and equals of pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding quarter, subject to a annualized) preferred return, or hurdle, and a catch up feature. The foregoing incentive fee is subject to a total return requirement, which provides that no incentive fee in respect of pre-incentive fee net investment income will be payable except to the extent that of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations over the then current and preceding calendar quarters exceeds the cumulative incentive fees accrued and/or paid for the preceding calendar quarters (the Incentive Fee Limitation ). Therefore, any ordinary income incentive fee that is payable in a calendar quarter will be limited to the lesser of (1) of the amount by which pre-incentive fee net investment income for such calendar quarter exceeds the hurdle, subject to the catch-up provision, and (2) (x) of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the then current and preceding calendar quarters minus (y) the cumulative incentive fees accrued and/or paid for the preceding calendar quarters. For the foregoing purpose, the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations is the sum of pre-incentive fee net investment income, realized gains and losses and unrealized gains and losses for the then current and preceding calendar quarters. The second part of the incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year in an amount equal to of realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of the year, computed net of all realized capital losses on a cumulative basis and unrealized depreciation, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees.

 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had U.S. dollar borrowings of and , respectively, and no borrowings denominated in a foreign currency as of either date. Any borrowings denominated in a foreign currency may be positively or negatively affected by movements in the rate of exchange between the U.S. dollar and the respective foreign currency. These movements are beyond the control of the Company and cannot be predicted. Borrowings denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars based on the spot rate at each balance sheet date. The impact resulting from changes in foreign currency borrowings is included in net change in unrealized gain (loss) on foreign currency and other transactions on the Company s consolidated statements of operations. 
 Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest, at the Company s election, at an annual rate of SOFR (one-month or three-month at the Company s discretion based on the term of the borrowing) plus or at a daily rate equal to per annum plus the greater of , the prime interest rate, the federal funds rate plus or SOFR plus , with a SOFR floor of . In addition to the stated interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee and certain conditional fees based on usage of the expanded borrowing base and usage of the asset coverage ratio flexibility. A commitment fee of per annum on any unused portion of the revolving credit facility if the utilized portion of the facility is greater than of the then available maximum borrowing or a commitment fee of per annum on any unused portion of the revolving credit facility if the utilized portion of the facility is less than or equal to of the then available maximum borrowing. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the outstanding borrowings were accruing at a weighted average interest rate of and , respectively.

 and , respectively, in outstanding commitments to fund investments under undrawn revolvers, delayed draw commitments and subscription agreements, excluding unfunded commitments in SLF. As described in Note 3, the Company had unfunded commitments of , to SLF as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, that may be contributed primarily for the purpose of funding new investments approved by the SLF investment committee. Drawdowns of the commitments to SLF require authorization from one of the Company s representatives on SLF s board of managers. Management believes that the Company s available cash balances and/or ability to draw on the revolving credit facility provide sufficient funds to cover its unfunded commitments as of September 30, 2024. 
 Indemnification: In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and agreements that contain a variety of representations and warranties that provide general indemnification. The Company s maximum exposure under these agreements is unknown, as these involve future claims that may be made against the Company but that have not occurred. The Company expects the risk of any future obligations under these indemnification provisions to be remote. 
 Concentration of credit and counterparty risk: Credit risk arises primarily from the potential inability of counterparties to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract. In the event that the counterparties do not fulfill their obligations, the Company may be exposed to risk. The risk of default depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparties or issuers of the instruments. It is the Company s policy to review, as necessary, the credit standing of each counterparty. 
 Market risk: The Company s investments and borrowings are subject to market risk. Market risk is the potential for changes in the value due to market changes. Market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the investments and borrowings are traded. 
 Legal proceedings: In the normal course of business, the Company may be subject to legal and regulatory proceedings that are generally incidental to its ongoing operations. While there can be no assurance of the ultimate disposition of any such proceedings, the Company is not currently aware of any such proceedings or disposition that would have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 Contingencies : As of September 30, 2024, the Company has recorded a contingent liability related to a Level 1 equity investment, identified on the consolidated schedule of investments, that has a contingency in which a portion of the shares held by the Company would need to be returned. The contingent liability was initially recorded at an amortized cost of . As of September 30, 2024, the contingent liability is recorded at a fair value of and is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. For each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an unrealized gain on the contingent liability of which is included in net change in unrealized gain (loss) on foreign currency and other transactions on the consolidated statements of operations. Please refer to the footnotes to the schedule of investments as of September 30, 2024 for additional information.

 (1) The per share data was derived by using the weighted average shares outstanding during the periods presented. 
 (2) Management monitors available taxable earnings, including net investment income and realized capital gains, to determine if a tax return of capital may occur for the year. To the extent the Company s taxable earnings fall below the total amount of the Company s distributions for that fiscal year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a tax return of capital to the Company s stockholders. The tax character of distributions will be determined at the end of the fiscal year. However, if the character of such distributions were determined as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, none of the distributions would have been characterized as a tax return of capital to the Company s stockholders; this tax return of capital may differ from the return of capital calculated with reference to net investment income for financial reporting purposes. 
 (3) Total return based on market value is calculated assuming a purchase of common shares at the market value on the first day and a sale at the market value on the last day of the periods reported. Distributions, if any, are assumed for purposes of this calculation to be reinvested at prices obtained under the Company s DRIP. Total return based on market value does not reflect brokerage commissions. Return calculation is not annualized.

 Overview 
 Monroe Capital Corporation is an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act ). In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company RIC under subchapter M of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). We currently qualify and intend to continue to qualify annually to be treated as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 We are a specialty finance company that is focused on providing financing solutions primarily to lower middle-market companies in the United States and Canada. We provide customized financing solutions focused primarily on senior secured, junior secured and unitranche secured (a combination of senior secured and junior secured debt in the same facility in which we syndicate a first out portion of the loan to an investor and retain a last out portion of the loan) debt and, to a lesser extent, unsecured subordinated debt and equity, including equity co-investments in preferred and common stock, and warrants. 
 Our shares are currently listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol MRCC . 
 77 

Table of Contents 

As of September 30, 2024, our portfolio included approximately 79.2 senior secured loans, 0.8 unitranche secured loans, 6.4 junior secured loans and 13.6 equity securities, compared to December 31, 2023, when our portfolio included approximately 79.6 senior secured loans, 2.8 unitranche secured loans, 5.5 junior secured loans and 12.1 equity securities. 
 While our primary focus is to maximize current income and capital appreciation through debt investments in thinly traded or private U.S. companies, we may invest a portion of the portfolio in opportunistic investments in order to seek to enhance returns to stockholders. Such investments may include investments in real estate, specialty finance, litigation finance, fund finance, high-yield bonds, distressed debt, private equity or securities of public companies that are not thinly traded and securities of middle-market companies located outside of the United States. We expect that these public companies generally will have debt securities that are non-investment grade. 
 Investment income 
 We generate interest income on the debt investments in portfolio company investments that we originate or acquire. Our debt investments, whether in the form of senior secured, unitranche secured or junior secured debt, typically have an initial term of three to seven years and bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. In some instances, we receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. In some cases, our investments provide for deferred interest of payment-in-kind PIK interest. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, amendment, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income. We record prepayment premiums and prepayment gains (losses) on loans as interest income. As the frequency or volume of the repayments which trigger these prepayment premiums and prepayment gains (losses) may fluctuate significantly from period to period, the associated interest income recorded may also fluctuate significantly from period to period. Interest and fee income is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent we expect to collect such amounts. Interest income is accrued based upon the outstanding principal amount and contractual terms of debt and preferred equity investments. Interest is accrued on a daily basis. We record fees on loans based on the determination of whether the fee is considered a yield enhancement or payment for a service. If the fee is considered a yield enhancement associated with a funding of cash on a loan, the fee is generally deferred and recognized into interest income using the effective interest method if captured in the cost basis or using the straight-line method if the loan is unfunded and therefore there is no cost basis. If the fee is not considered a yield enhancement because a service was provided, and the fee is payment for that service, the fee is deemed earned and recorded as other income in the period the service is completed. 
 Dividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies. Each distribution received from limited liability company LLC and limited partnership LP investments is evaluated to determine if the distribution should be recorded as dividend income or a return of capital. Generally, we will not record distributions from equity investments in LLCs and LPs as dividend income unless there are sufficient accumulated tax-basis earnings and profits in the LLC or LP prior to the distribution. Distributions that are classified as a return of capital are recorded as a reduction in the cost basis of the investment. The frequency and volume of the distributions on common equity securities and LLC and LP investments may fluctuate significantly from period to period.

Expenses 
 Our primary operating expenses include the payment of base management and incentive fees to MC Advisors, under the investment advisory and management agreement (the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement ), the payment of fees to MC Management for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses under the administration agreement (the Administration Agreement and other operating costs. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements and Related Party Transactions below for additional information on our Investment Advisory and Management Agreement and Administration Agreement. Our expenses also include interest expense on indebtedness. We bear all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions. 
 Net gain (loss) 
 We recognize realized gains or losses on investments, foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency and other transactions based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the cost basis without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized within net realized gain (loss) on the consolidated statements of operations. We record current period changes in fair value of investments, foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency and other transactions within net change in unrealized gain (loss) on the consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 Portfolio and Investment Activity 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we invested 11.1 million in three new portfolio companies and we invested 14.7 million in 30 existing portfolio companies and had 38.3 million in aggregate amount of sales and principal repayments, resulting in a net decrease in investments of 12.5 million for the period. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we invested 27.6 million in six new portfolio companies and 44.1 million in 51 existing portfolio companies and had 86.3 million in aggregate amount of sales and principal repayments, resulting in a net decrease in investments of 14.6 million for the period. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we invested 2.0 million in one new portfolio companies and 10.7 million in 29 existing portfolio companies and had 6.7 million in aggregate amount of sales and principal repayments, resulting in a net decrease in investments of 6.0 million for the period. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we invested 18.1 million in six new portfolio companies and 34.1 million in 43 existing portfolio companies and had 63.7 million in aggregate amount of sales and principal repayments, resulting in a net decrease in investments of 11.5 million for the period.

 (1) The weighted average annualized contractual coupon yield at period end is computed by dividing (a) the interest income on our debt investments and preferred equity investments (with a stated coupon rate) at the period end contractual coupon rate for each investment by (b) the par value of our debt investments (excluding debt investments acquired for no cost in a restructuring on non-accrual status) and the cost basis of our preferred equity investments. We exclude loans acquired for no cost in a restructuring on non-accrual status within this metric as management believes this disclosure provides a better indication of return on invested capital. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no loans excluded from the weighted average contractual coupon yield. 
 (2) The weighted average annualized effective yield on portfolio investments at period end is computed by dividing (a) interest income on our debt investments and preferred equity investments (with a stated coupon rate) at the period end effective rate for each investment by (b) the par value of our debt investments (excluding debt investments acquired for no cost in a restructuring on non-accrual status) and the cost basis of our preferred equity investments. We exclude loans acquired for no cost in a restructuring on non-accrual status within this metric as management believes this disclosure provides a better indication of return on invested capital. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no loans excluded from the weighted average effective yield. The weighted average annualized effective yield on portfolio investments is a metric on the investment portfolio alone and does not represent a return to stockholders. This metric is not inclusive of our fees and expenses, the impact of leverage on the portfolio or sales load that may be paid by stockholders.

 Our portfolio composition remained relatively consistent with our portfolio at December 31, 2023. The decreases in yields were primarily due to the decline in base rates during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and an increase in the number of portfolio companies on non-accrual status.

 MC Advisors portfolio management staff closely monitors all credits, with senior portfolio managers covering agented and more complex investments. MC Advisors segregates our capital markets investments by industry. The MC Advisors monitoring process and projections developed by Monroe Capital both have daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly components and related reports, each to evaluate performance against historical, budget and underwriting expectations. MC Advisors analysts will monitor performance using standard industry software tools to provide consistent disclosure of performance. When necessary, MC Advisors will update our internal risk ratings, borrowing base criteria and covenant compliance reports. 
 81 

Table of Contents 

As part of the monitoring process, MC Advisors regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our investments and rates each of them based on an internal proprietary system that uses the categories listed below, which we refer to as MC Advisors investment performance risk rating. For any investment rated in Grades 3, 4 or 5, MC Advisors, through its internal Portfolio Management Group PMG ), will increase its monitoring intensity and prepare regular updates for the investment committee, summarizing current operating results and material impending events and suggesting recommended actions. The PMG is responsible for oversight and management of any investments rated in Grades 3, 4, or 5. MC Advisors monitors and, when appropriate, changes the investment ratings assigned to each investment in our portfolio. In connection with our valuation process, MC Advisors reviews these investment performance risk ratings on a quarterly basis. The investment performance risk rating system is described as follows: 
 Investment 
 Performance 
 Risk Rating 
 Summary Description Grade 1 Includes investments exhibiting the least amount of risk in our portfolio. The issuer is performing above expectations or the issuer s operating trends and risk factors are generally positive. Grade 2 Includes investments exhibiting an acceptable level of risk that is similar to the risk at the time of origination. The issuer is generally performing as expected or the risk factors are neutral to positive. Grade 3 Includes investments performing below expectations and indicates that the investment s risk has increased somewhat since origination. The issuer may be out of compliance with debt covenants; however, scheduled loan payments are generally not past due. Grade 4 Includes an issuer performing materially below expectations and indicates that the issuer s risk has increased materially since origination. In addition to the issuer being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, scheduled loan payments may be past due (but generally not more than six months past due). Grade 5 Indicates that the issuer is performing substantially below expectations and the investment risk has substantially increased since origination. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance or payments are substantially delinquent. Investments graded 5 are not anticipated to be repaid in full. 
 Our investment performance risk ratings do not constitute any rating of investments by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or reflect or represent any third-party assessment of any of our investments. 
 In the event of a delinquency or a decision to rate an investment Grade 4 or Grade 5, the PMG, in consultation with the investment committee, will develop an action plan. Such a plan may require a meeting with the borrower s management or the lender group to discuss reasons for the default and the steps management is undertaking to address the under-performance, as well as amendments and waivers that may be required. In the event of a dramatic deterioration of a credit, MC Advisors and the PMG will form a team or engage outside advisors to analyze, evaluate and take further steps to preserve our value in the credit. In this regard, we would expect to explore all options, including in a private equity sponsored investment, assuming certain responsibilities for the private equity sponsor or a formal sale of the business with oversight of the sale process by us. The PMG and the investment committee have extensive experience in running debt work-out transactions and bankruptcies.

Investment income decreased primarily due to a decline in interest income and PIK interest income as a result of a decrease in average invested assets and the placement of additional portfolio companies on non-accrual status.

Additionally, decreases in interest expense primarily from lower average debt outstanding and base management fees from lower invested assets during the current year periods contributed to the decreases in operating expenses. 
 Income Taxes, Including Excise Taxes 
 We have elected to be treated, currently qualify, and intend to continue to qualify annually as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and operate in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment available to RICs. To maintain qualification as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements and distribute to stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90 of our investment company taxable income, which is generally our net ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses. 
 Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may choose to carry forward such taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions from such current year taxable income into the next year and pay U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates and a 4 excise tax on such income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income may exceed estimated current year dividend distributions, we accrue excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as such taxable income is earned. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a net expense on the consolidated statements of operations of 0.1 million and 0.3 million, respectively, for U.S. federal excise tax. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a net expense on the consolidated statements of operations of 0.2 million and 0.3 million, respectively, for U.S. federal excise tax. 
 Certain of our consolidated subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal and state corporate-level income taxes. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a net tax expense (benefit) of zero and (13) thousand on the consolidated statements of operations for these subsidiaries, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a net tax expense of zero and 0.2 million on the consolidated statements of operations for these subsidiaries, respectively.

 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had sales or dispositions of investments resulting in 0.6 million and 30 thousand of net realized gain (loss) on investments, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had sales or dispositions of investments resulting in 1.1 million and 39.1) million of net realized gain (loss) on investments, respectively. The net realized gains during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily related to the realization of the previously recorded unrealized losses on our investments in Seran BioScience, LLC and AdTheorent, Inc. The net realized losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily related to the realization of the previously recorded unrealized losses on our investment in Vinci Brands LLC, California Pizza Kitchen, Inc. and Forman Mills. 
 We may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. For both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 there were no foreign currency forward contracts held. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had no net realized gain (loss) on foreign currency and other transactions and 4) thousand of net realized gain (loss) on foreign currency and other transactions, respectively.

 Net Change in Unrealized Gain (Loss) 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our investments had 2.2) million and 5.7) million of net change in unrealized gain (loss), respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our investments had 8.3) million and 19.8 million of net change in unrealized gain (loss), respectively. The net change in unrealized gain (loss) includes both unrealized gain on investments in our portfolio with mark-to-market gains during the periods and unrealized loss on investments in our portfolio with mark-to-market losses during the periods. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the net change in unrealized gain (loss) on investments was primarily attributable to unrealized mark-to-market losses attributable to certain portfolio companies that have underlying credit performance concerns that were still held as of September 30, 2024, partially offset by net unrealized gains on the remainder of the portfolio. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the net change in unrealized gain (loss) on investments was primarily attributable to unrealized mark-to-market losses related to financial performance of a few specific portfolio companies still held in the portfolio that were affected by macroeconomic and idiosyncratic challenges which impacted financial performance and unrealized mark-to-market losses attributable to our investment in SLF. The SLF s underlying investments are loans to middle-market borrowers that are generally larger than the rest of our portfolio, which is focused on lower middle-market companies. These upper middle-market loans held within the SLF experienced higher volatility in valuation than the rest of the portfolio. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the net change in unrealized gain (loss) on investments was primarily attributable to the reversal of previously recorded unrealized losses upon the disposition of certain assets during the period. This was offset by unrealized mark-to-market losses related to financial performance of a few specific portfolio companies still held in the portfolio and unrealized mark-to-market losses attributable to our investment in SLF.

Distributions 
 Our Board will determine the timing and amount, if any, of our distributions. We intend to pay distributions on a quarterly basis. In order to avoid corporate-level tax on the income we distribute as a RIC, we must distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, on an annual basis out of the assets legally available for such distributions. In addition, we also intend to distribute any realized net capital gains (i.e., realized net long-term capital gains in excess of realized net short-term capital losses) at least annually out of the assets legally available for such distributions. Distributions to stockholders for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled (5.4) million 0.25 per share) and (16.3) million 0.75 per share), and (16.3) million 0.75 per share), respectively. The tax character of such distributions is determined at the end of the fiscal year. However, if the character of such distributions were determined as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, no portion of these distributions would have been characterized as a return of capital to stockholders. 
 In October 2012, we adopted an opt out DRIP for our common stockholders. When we declare a distribution, our stockholders cash distributions will automatically be reinvested in additional shares of our common stock unless a stockholder specifically opts out of our DRIP. If a stockholder opts out, that stockholder will receive cash distributions. Although distributions paid in the form of additional shares of our common stock will generally be subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes in the same manner as cash distributions, stockholders participating in our DRIP will not receive any corresponding cash distributions with which to pay any such applicable taxes. 
 
 MRCC Senior Loan Fund I, LLC

Investments held by SLF are measured at fair value using the same valuation methodologies as described below. Our investment is illiquid in nature as SLF does not allow for withdrawal from the LLC or the sale of a member s interest unless approved by the board members of SLF.

 Related Party Transactions 
 We have a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following: 
 We have an Investment Advisory and Management Agreement with MC Advisors, an investment advisor registered with the SEC, to manage our investing activities. We pay MC Advisors a fee for its services under the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement consisting of two components - a base management fee and an incentive fee. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements and Significant Accounting Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies - Capital Gains Incentive Fee for additional information. 
 100 

Table of Contents 

 We have an Administration Agreement with MC Management to provide us with the office facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 SLF has an administration agreement with MC Management to provide SLF with certain loan servicing and administrative functions. SLF may reimburse MC Management for its allocable share of overhead and other expenses incurred by MC Management. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements and Liquidity and Capital Resources - MRCC Senior Loan Fund I, LLC for additional information. 
 Theodore L. Koenig, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board is also a manager of MC Advisors and the Chief Executive Officer of MC Management. Lewis W. Solimene, Jr., our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Investment Officer, is also a managing director of MC Management. 
 We have a license agreement with Monroe Capital LLC, under which Monroe Capital LLC has agreed to grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name Monroe Capital for specified purposes in our business. 
 In addition, we have adopted a formal code of ethics that governs the conduct of MC Advisors officers, directors and employees. Our officers and directors also remain subject to the duties imposed by both the 1940 Act and Maryland General Corporation Law. 
 
 Commitments and Contingencies and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 Commitments and Contingencies 
 Commitments: As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had outstanding commitments to fund investments under undrawn revolvers, delayed draw commitments and subscription agreements, excluding unfunded commitments in SLF, totaling 37.9 million and 37.2 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had unfunded commitments to SLF of 7.3 million, that may be contributed primarily for the purpose of funding new investments approved by the SLF investment committee. Drawdowns of the commitments to SLF require authorization from one of our representatives on SLF s board of managers. Additionally, we have entered into certain contracts with other parties that contain a variety of indemnifications. Our maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, we have not experienced claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and believe the risk of loss related to such indemnifications to be remote. 
 Contingencies: As of September 30, 2024, we have recorded a contingent liability related to a Level 1 equity investment, identified on the consolidated schedule of investments, that has a contingency in which a portion of the shares held by us would need to be returned. The contingent liability was initially recorded at an amortized cost of 0.2 million. As of September 30, 2024, the contingent liability is recorded at a fair value of 0.1 million and is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. For each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded an unrealized gain on the contingent liability of 20 thousand which is included in net change in unrealized gain (loss) on foreign currency and other transactions on the consolidated statements of operations. Please refer to the footnotes to the schedule of investments as of September 30, 2024 for additional information. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 Other than contractual commitments and other legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of our business, we do not have any off-balance sheet financings or liabilities. 
 
 Market Trends 
 We have identified the following general trends that may affect our business: 
 Target Market : We believe that small and middle-market companies in the United States with annual revenues between 10.0 million and 2.5 billion represent a significant growth segment of the U.S. economy and often require substantial capital investments to grow. Middle-market companies have generated a significant number of investment opportunities for investment funds managed or advised by Monroe Capital, and we believe that this market segment will continue to produce significant investment opportunities for us. 
 101 

Table of Contents 

 Specialized Lending Requirements : We believe that several factors render many U.S. financial institutions ill-suited to lend to U.S. middle-market companies. For example, based on the experience of our management team, lending to U.S. middle-market companies (1) is generally more labor intensive than lending to larger companies due to the smaller size of each investment and the fragmented nature of information for such companies, (2) requires due diligence and underwriting practices consistent with the demands and economic limitations of the middle-market and (3) may also require more extensive ongoing monitoring by the lender. 
 Demand for Debt Capital : We believe there is a large pool of uninvested private equity capital for middle-market companies. We expect private equity firms will seek to leverage their investments by combining equity capital with senior secured loans and mezzanine debt from other sources, such as us. 
 Competition from Other Lenders : We believe that many traditional bank lenders, in recent years, de-emphasized their service and product offerings to middle-market businesses in favor of lending to large corporate clients and managing capital market transactions. In addition, many commercial banks face significant balance sheet constraints as they seek to build capital and meet future regulatory capital requirements. These factors may result in opportunities for alternative funding sources to middle-market companies and therefore drive increased new investment opportunities for us. Conversely, there has been a significant amount of capital raised over the past several years dedicated to middle market lending which has increased competitive pressure in the BDC and investment company marketplace for senior and subordinated debt, which in turn could result in lower yields and weaker financial covenants for new assets. 
 Pricing and Deal Structures : We believe that the volatility in global markets over the last several years and current macroeconomic issues including changes in bank regulations for middle-market banks has reduced access to, and availability of, debt capital to middle-market companies, causing a reduction in competition and generally more favorable capital structures and deal terms. Sizable recent capital raises in the private debt marketplace have created significantly increased competition over the last few years, reducing available pricing and creating less favorable capital structures; however, we believe that current market conditions for our target market may continue to create favorable opportunities to invest at attractive risk-adjusted returns. 
 Market Environment: We believe middle market investments are attractive in the uncertain market environments such as the current market environment where inflationary pressure and interest rates remain elevated. Directly originated middle market loans have demonstrated the ability to outperform competing markets through varying economic cycles including downturns and prior periods of monetary policy tightening. Through the global financial crisis, the higher interest rate environment in 2005-2006, market bottom in 2008 and the subsequent recovery period, as well as throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, these investments have historically generated considerable yield premium with more favorable capital structures for lenders, resulting in higher returns when compared to the market for U.S. high yield bonds and U.S. traded loans. (1) Middle market direct lending also offers a natural hedge to higher interest rates with floating rate structures that benefit from higher interest rates, while providing broad diversification in an environment where there is a risk of increased default rate activity. We believe that direct lending volumes will continue outpacing syndicated loan transaction volumes due to capital requirements and liquidity constraints faced by banks. From late 2022 and throughout 2023, the middle market saw a consistent trend toward lower leverage and loan-to-value structures coupled with increased spreads. However, as M A activity has continued to rebound throughout 2024, leverage and loan-to-value attachment points have stabilized while spreads have compressed in certain pockets of the market. (2) We believe that the increase in M A activity, which will be further bolstered by the most recent Federal Reserve rate cut, will continue to drive deal flow in the middle market. That said, we note that a softening macroeconomic environment and elevated interest rates could result in increased default rates. If default rates become more prevalent, we would expect to experience decreased net interest income, lower yields and increased risk of credit loss. However, we believe that Monroe Capital s scale, product suite, diversification, and strong historical recovery rate track record will continue to allow us to find attractive investment opportunities and navigate this uncertain market environment while generating attractive risk-adjusted returns.

 Recent Developments 
 On October 22, 2024, Monroe Capital LLC Monroe Capital ), an affiliate of ours, announced that Monroe Capital has entered into a definitive agreement with Wendel Group (Euronext: MF:FP) Wendel relating to Wendel s strategic investment in Monroe Capital. 
 The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory clearances and approvals and client consents. In connection with the transaction, we expect to seek approval of a new investment advisory agreement between us and our investment adviser, MC Advisors, an affiliate of Monroe Capital, from our Board of Directors and our stockholders, the terms of which are expected to remain substantively similar to the current investment advisory agreement. It is anticipated that all of the officers and investment professionals of the investment adviser will remain at the investment adviser. 
 
 Significant Accounting Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies 
 Revenue Recognition 
 We record interest and fee income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. For loans and debt securities with contractual PIK interest, we do not accrue PIK interest if the portfolio company valuation indicates that such PIK interest is not collectible. We do not accrue as a receivable interest on loans and debt securities if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such interest. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized and amortized into interest income over the contractual life of the respective investment using the effective interest method. Upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, any unamortized premium or discount or loan origination fees are recorded as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income when we receive such amounts. Interest income is accrued based upon the outstanding principal amount and contractual terms of debt and preferred equity investments. Interest is accrued on a daily basis. We record fees on loans based on the determination of whether the fee is considered a yield enhancement or payment for a service. If the fee is considered a yield enhancement associated with a funding of cash on a loan, the fee is generally deferred and recognized into interest income using the effective interest method if captured in the cost basis or using the straight-line method if the loan is unfunded and therefore there is no cost basis. If the fee is not considered a yield enhancement because a service was provided, and the fee is payment for that service, the fee is deemed earned and recorded as other income in the period the service is completed. 
 Dividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies. Each distribution received from LLC and LP investments is evaluated to determine if the distribution should be recorded as dividend income or a return of capital. Generally, we will not record distributions from equity investments in LLCs and LPs as dividend income unless there are sufficient accumulated tax-basis earnings and profits in the LLC or LP prior to the distribution. Distributions that are classified as a return of capital are recorded as a reduction in the cost basis of the investment. 
 Valuation of Portfolio Investments 
 For periods prior to September 30, 2022, the Board determined the fair value of our investments in good faith on a quarterly basis. On September 30, 2022, pursuant to SEC Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, the Board designated MC Advisors as our valuation designee (the Valuation Designee ). The Board is responsible for oversight of the Valuation Designee. The Valuation Designee has established a valuation committee to determine in good faith the fair value of our investments, based on input of the Valuation Designee s management and personnel and independent valuation firms which are engaged at the direction of the valuation committee to assist in the valuation of certain portfolio investments lacking a readily available market quotation. The valuation committee determines fair values pursuant to a valuation policy approved by the Board and pursuant to a consistently applied valuation process. 
 103 

Table of Contents 

 Under the valuation policy, the Valuation Designee values investments for which market quotations are readily available and within a recent date at such market quotations. When doing so, the Valuation Designee determines whether the quote obtained is sufficient in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America GAAP to determine the fair value of the security. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available or whose market prices are not regularly updated are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Valuation Designee. Because we expect that there will not be a readily available market for many of the investments in our portfolio, we expect to value many of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our Valuation Designee using a documented valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. Such determination of fair values may involve subjective judgments and estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments, and the differences could be material. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we could realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material. 
 With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, the Valuation Designee undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below: 
 the quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially evaluated and rated by the investment professionals of the Valuation Designee responsible for the credit monitoring of the portfolio investment; 
 our Valuation Designee engages an independent valuation firm to conduct independent appraisals of a selection of investments for which market quotations are not readily available. We will consult with an independent valuation firm relative to each portfolio company at least once in every calendar year, but the independent appraisals are generally received quarterly for each investment; 
 to the extent an independent valuation firm is not engaged to conduct an investment appraisal on an investment for which market quotations are not readily available, the investment will be valued by the Valuation Designee; 
 preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with the valuation committee of the Valuation Designee; 
 the valuation conclusions are approved by the valuation committee of the Valuation Designee; and 
 a report prepared by the Valuation Designee is presented to the Board quarterly to allow the Board to perform its oversight duties of the valuation process and the Valuation Designee. 
 The Valuation Designee generally uses the income approach to determine fair value for loans where market quotations are not readily available, as long as it is appropriate. If there is deterioration in credit quality or a debt investment is in workout status, the Valuation Designee may consider other factors in determining the fair value, including the value attributable to the debt investment from the enterprise value of the portfolio company or the proceeds that would be received in a liquidation analysis. This liquidation analysis may also include probability weighting of alternative outcomes. The Valuation Designee generally considers our debt to be performing if the borrower is not in default, the borrower is remitting payments in a timely manner, the loan is in covenant compliance and the loan is otherwise not deemed to be impaired. In determining the fair value of the performing debt, the Valuation Designee considers fluctuations in current interest rates, the trends in yields of debt instruments with similar credit ratings, financial condition of the borrower, economic conditions and other relevant factors, both qualitative and quantitative. In the event that a debt instrument is not performing, as defined above, the Valuation Designee will evaluate the value of the collateral utilizing the same framework described above for a performing loan to determine the value of the debt instrument. 
 Under the income approach, discounted cash flow models are utilized to determine the present value of the future cash flow streams of our debt investments, based on future interest and principal payments as set forth in the associated loan agreements. In determining fair value under the income approach, the Valuation Designee also considers the following factors: applicable market yields and leverage levels, recent transactions, credit quality, prepayment penalties, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments, and changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets that generally may affect the price at which similar investments may be made. 
 104 

Table of Contents 

 Under the market approach, the enterprise value methodology is typically utilized to determine the fair value of an investment. There is no one methodology to estimate enterprise value and, in fact, for any one portfolio company, enterprise value is generally best expressed as a range of values, from which the Valuation Designee derives a single estimate of enterprise value. In estimating the enterprise value of a portfolio company, the Valuation Designee analyzes various factors consistent with industry practice, including but not limited to original transaction multiples, the portfolio company s historical and projected financial results, applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and leverage levels, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, and comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public. Typically, the enterprise values of private companies are based on multiples of earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA ), cash flows, net income, revenues, or in limited cases, book value. 
 In addition, for certain investments, the Valuation Designee may base its valuation on indicative bid and ask prices provided by an independent third-party pricing service. Bid prices reflect the highest price that we and others may be willing to pay. Ask prices represent the lowest price that we and others may be willing to accept. The Valuation Designee generally use the midpoint of the bid/ask range as our best estimate of fair value of such investment. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our Valuation Designee determined, in good faith, the fair value of our investment portfolio in accordance with GAAP and our valuation procedures based on the facts and circumstances known by us at that time, or reasonably expected to be known at that time. 
 Net Realized Gain or Loss and Net Change in Unrealized Gain or Loss 
 We measure realized gain or loss by the difference between the net proceeds from the sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized gain or loss previously recognized. Net change in unrealized gain or loss reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized gain or loss, when gain or loss is realized. Additionally, we do not isolate the change in fair value resulting from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations from the changes in the fair values of the underlying investment. All fluctuations in fair value are included in net change in unrealized gain (loss) on investments on our consolidated statements of operations. 
 Capital Gains Incentive Fee 
 Pursuant to the terms of the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement with MC Advisors, the incentive fee on capital gains earned on liquidated investments of our portfolio is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement). This fee equals 20 of our incentive fee capital gains (i.e., our realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception, calculated as of the end of the applicable period, net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis), less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fees. On a quarterly basis, we accrue for the capital gains incentive fee by calculating such fee as if it were due and payable as of the end of such period. 
 While the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement with MC Advisors neither includes nor contemplates the inclusion of unrealized gains in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee, pursuant to an interpretation of an American Institute for Certified Public Accountants Technical Practice Aid for investment companies, we include unrealized gains in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee expense and related accrued capital gains incentive fee. This accrual reflects the incentive fees that would be payable to MC Advisors if our entire portfolio was liquidated at its fair value as of the balance sheet date even though MC Advisors is not entitled to an incentive fee with respect to unrealized gains unless and until such gains are actually realized. 
 During both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not have any further reductions in accrued capital gains incentive fees as they were already at zero, primarily as a result of accumulated realized and unrealized losses on the portfolio.

 New Accounting Pronouncements 
 In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform ASU 2020-04 ). The amendments in ASU 2020-04 provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The standard is effective as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2024. We did not utilize the optional expedients and exceptions provided by ASU 2020-04 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) ASU 2022-03 ), which affects all entities that have investments in equity securities measured at fair value that are subject to a contractual sale restriction. The amendments in ASU 2022-03 clarify that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring the fair value. The amendments also require additional disclosures for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions that are measured at fair value in accordance with Topic 820. The amendments in ASU 2022-03 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2022-03 on our financial statements. 
 In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280) ASU 2023-07 ), which enhances disclosure requirements about significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (the CODM ). ASU 2023-07, among other things, (i) requires a single segment public entity to provide all of the disclosures as required by Topic 280, (ii) requires a public entity to disclose the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources and (iii) provides the ability for a public entity to elect more than one performance measure. ASU 2023-07 is effective for the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted and retrospective adoption is required for all prior periods presented. We are currently assessing the impact of this guidance, however, we do not expect a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 , Income Taxes (Topic 740) ASU 2023-09 ), which updates income tax disclosure requirements related to rate reconciliation, income taxes paid and other disclosures. ASU 2023-09 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 and is to be adopted on a prospective basis with the option to apply retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2023-09 on our financial statements. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including valuation risk, interest rate risk, currency risk and inflation and supply chain risk. The prices of securities held by us may decline in response to certain events, including those directly involving the companies we invest in; conditions affecting the general economy; overall market changes; legislative reform; local, regional, national or global political, social or economic instability, including related to the elevated inflation; and interest rate fluctuations. 
 Valuation Risk 
 Our investments may not have readily available market quotations (as such term is defined in Rule 2a-5, under the 1940 Act), and those investments which do not have readily available market quotations are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our Valuation Designee in accordance with our valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, these estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed, and it is possible that the difference could be material. 
 In accordance with Rule 2a-5, under the 1940 Act, our Board periodically assesses and manages material risks associated with the determination of the fair value of our investments. 
 106 

Table of Contents 

 Interest Rate Risk 
 The majority of the loans in our portfolio have floating interest rates, and we expect that our loans in the future may also have floating interest rates. These loans are usually based on a floating SOFR and typically have interest rate re-set provisions that adjust applicable interest rates under such loans to current market rates on a monthly or quarterly basis. The majority of the loans in our current portfolio have interest rate floors that will effectively convert the loans to fixed rate loans in the event interest rates decrease. In addition, our revolving credit facility has a floating interest rate provision, whereas our 2026 Notes have fixed interest rates until maturity. We expect that other credit facilities into which we may enter in the future may also have floating interest rate provisions. 
 Assuming that the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2024 was to remain constant and that we took no actions to alter our existing interest rate sensitivity, the following table shows the annualized impact of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates (in thousands): 
 Change in Interest Rates Increase (decrease) in interest income Increase (decrease) in interest expense Net increase 
 (decrease) in net 
 investment income (1) 
 Down 300 basis points 
 (11,337) (5,070) (6,267) Down 200 basis points (7,565) (3,380) (4,185) Down 100 basis points (3,783) (1,690) (2,093) Up 100 basis points 3,808 1,690 2,118 Up 200 basis points 7,616 3,380 4,236 Up 300 basis points 11,425 5,070 6,355 
 ________________________________________________________ 
 (1) Excludes the impact of income-based incentive fees. See Note 6 for more information on income-based incentive fees. 
 Although we believe that this analysis is indicative of our existing sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not adjust for changes in the credit market, credit quality, the size and composition of the assets in our portfolio and other business developments, including borrowing under the credit facility or other borrowings that could affect net increase in net assets resulting from operations, or net income. Accordingly, we can offer no assurances that actual results would not differ materially from the analysis above. 
 We may in the future hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts to the extent permitted under the 1940 Act and applicable commodities laws. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to the investments in our portfolio with fixed interest rates or interest rate floors. 
 Currency Risk 
 We may also have exposure to foreign currencies related to certain investments. Such investments are translated into U.S. dollars based on the spot rate at each balance sheet date, exposing us to movements in the exchange rate. In order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates, we may borrow in foreign currency under our revolving credit facility to finance such investments or we may enter into foreign currency forward contracts. As of September 30, 2024, we held no investments in foreign currencies or foreign currency forward contracts. 
 Inflation and Supply Chain Risk 
 Economic activity has continued to accelerate across sectors and regions. Nevertheless, due to global supply chain issues, geopolitical events, a rise in energy prices and strong consumer demand as economies continue to reopen, inflation is showing signs of acceleration in the U.S. and globally. Inflation is likely to continue in the near to medium-term, particularly in the U.S., with the possibility that monetary policy may tighten in response. Persistent inflationary pressures could affect our portfolio companies profit margins.

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 In accordance with Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), we, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that, at the end of the period covered by our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and provided reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our periodic SEC filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within the Company to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in the Company s periodic reports. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 No change occurred in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
