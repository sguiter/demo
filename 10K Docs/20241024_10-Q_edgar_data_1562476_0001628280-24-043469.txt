 inventory impairment recorded. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded million of inventory impairment relating to one of our communities in our East reporting segment. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded million of impairment charges relating to one of our communities in our West reporting segment. Inventory impairments are recorded to Cost of home closings on the unaudited Condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 In certain cases, we may elect to cease development and/or marketing of an existing community if we believe the economic performance of the community would be maximized by deferring development for a period of time to allow for market conditions to improve. We refer to such communities as long-term strategic assets. The decision may be based on financial and/or operational metrics as determined by us. For those communities that have been temporarily closed or development has been discontinued, we do not allocate interest or other costs to the community's inventory until activity resumes. Such costs are expensed as incurred. In addition, if we decide to cease development, we will evaluate the project for impairment and then cease future development and marketing activity until such a time when we believe that market conditions have improved and economic performance can be maximized. Our assessment of the carrying value of our long-term strategic assets typically includes estimates of future performance, including the timing of when development will recommence, the type of product to be offered, and the margin to be realized. In the future, some of these inactive communities may be re-opened while others may be sold. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no long-term strategic assets. 
 Land banking arrangements We have land purchase agreements with various land sellers. As a method of acquiring land in staged takedowns, while limiting risk and minimizing the immediate use of funds from our available cash or other financing sources, we transfer our right under certain specific performance agreements to entities owned by third parties land banking arrangements ). These entities use equity contributions from their owners and/or incur debt to finance the acquisition and development of the land. We incur interest expense on these arrangements. Interest is based on remaining lots to be purchased and is capitalized for the percentage of lots in each project actively under development, with the remainder expensed and included in Interest expense/(income), net on the unaudited Condensed consolidated statements of operations. The entities grant us an option to acquire lots in staged takedowns. In consideration for this option, we make a non-significant and non-refundable cash deposit. We are not legally obligated to purchase the lots, but would forfeit any existing deposits and could be subject to financial and other penalties if the lots were not purchased. We do not have an ownership interest in these entities or title to their assets and do not guarantee their liabilities. As such, these entities are not consolidated. These land banking arrangements help us manage the financial and market risk associated with land holdings which are not included in the unaudited Condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had the right to purchase lots and lots under such land agreements for an aggregate purchase price of million and million, respectively. We are not legally obligated to purchase the balance of the lots. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our exposure to loss related to deposits on land banking arrangements totaled million and million, respectively.

 million of fair value adjustments for land held for sale in our West reporting segment. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had no such charges. Adjustments for land held for sale are recorded within Cost of land closings on the unaudited Condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 Real Estate Assets Held for Sale - During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we entered into an exclusive listing agreement for Build-To-Rent asset in Texas and Build-To-Rent asset in Arizona. As of September 30, 2024, we determined these Build-To-Rent assets, which are in our Corporate and Unallocated operating and reporting segment, to be classified as held for sale based on the criteria above. We expect both sales to occur during the fourth quarter of 2024. The carrying amounts for these Build-To-Rent assets are million and million, respectively and are included in property and equipment, net on the unaudited Condensed consolidated balance sheets. As the fair value is greater than the carrying value for each asset, no adjustment to fair value was recorded. There were assets classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2023. 
 We recorded impairment charges related to the investments in unconsolidated entities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 Stock Repurchase Program 
 On December 15, 2023 the Board of Directors authorized a renewal of the Company's then-existing stock repurchase program which permits the repurchase up to million of the Company s common stock through December 31, 2025. Repurchases under the program may occur from time to time through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or other transactions. On October 23, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized a renewal of the Company s stock repurchase program through December 31, 2026, which authorization replaced the Company s prior million repurchase authorization scheduled to expire on December 31, 2025. The stock repurchase program, as renewed, permits the repurchase of up to billion of the Company s Common Stock from October 23, 2024 through December 31, 2026. 
 
 Using the availability under our stock repurchase program, we entered into separate ASR agreements with the same financial institution during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We paid million for each agreement and received an initial delivery of of common stock shares, with the remaining received (or to be received) at final settlement in accordance with the terms of each ASR agreement. The final settlements for the first and second ASR agreements occurred during the third quarter of 2024, at which time, the volume-weighted average price calculations over the term of the ASR agreement were used to determine the final number of shares to be delivered. Final settlement of the third ASR agreement is expected to occur during the fourth quarter of 2024 consistent with the terms of the first and second ASR agreements. We accounted for the ASRs as common stock repurchases and forward contracts indexed to our own common stock. We determined that the equity classification criteria was met for the forward contracts; therefore, they were not accounted for as derivative instruments.

 billion and billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Although significant development and construction activities have been completed related to these site improvements, the bonds are generally not released until all development and construction activities are completed. We do not believe that it is probable that any outstanding bonds as of September 30, 2024 will be drawn upon. 
 Purchase Commitments We are subject to the usual obligations associated with entering into contracts (including land option contracts and land banking arrangements) for the purchase, development, and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business. We have a number of land purchase option contracts and land banking agreements, generally through cash deposits, for the right to purchase land or lots at a future point in time with predetermined terms. We do not have title to the property and the property owner and its creditors generally have no recourse. Our obligations with respect to such contracts are generally limited to the forfeiture of the related non-refundable cash deposits. The aggregate purchase price for land under these contracts was billion at September 30, 2024 and billion at December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Legal Proceedings We are involved in various litigation and legal claims in the normal course of business, including actions brought on behalf of various classes of claimants. We are also subject to a variety of local, state, and federal laws and regulations related to land development activities, house construction standards, sales practices, mortgage lending operations, employment practices, and protection of the environment. As a result, we are subject to periodic examination or inquiry by various governmental agencies that administer these laws and regulations. 
 We establish liabilities for legal claims and regulatory matters when such matters are both probable of occurring and any potential loss can be reasonably estimated. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our legal accruals were million and million, respectively. We accrue for such matters based on the facts and circumstances specific to each matter and revise these estimates as the matters evolve. In such cases, there may exist an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts currently accrued. Predicting the ultimate resolution of the pending matters, the related timing, or the eventual loss associated with these matters is inherently difficult. Accordingly, the liability arising from the ultimate resolution of any matter may exceed the estimate reflected in the accrued liabilities relating to such matter. While the outcome of such contingencies cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the resolution of such matters will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. 
 On April 26, 2017, a class action complaint was filed in the Circuit Court of the Tenth Judicial Circuit in and for Polk County, Florida by Norman Gundel, William Mann, and Brenda Taylor against Avatar Properties, Inc. (an acquired AV Homes entity) ("Avatar"), generally alleging that our collection of club membership fees in connection with the use of one of our amenities in our East homebuilding segment violates various laws relating to homeowner associations and other Florida-specific laws (the "Solivita litigation"). The class action complaint sought an injunction to prohibit future collection of club membership fees. On November 2, 2021, the court determined that the club membership fees were improper and that plaintiffs were entitled to million in fee reimbursements. We appealed the court s ruling to the Sixth District Court of Appeal (the "District Court") on November 29, 2021, and the plaintiffs agreed to continue to pay club membership fees pending the outcome of the appeal. On June 23, 2023 the District Court affirmed the trial court judgment in a split decision, with three separate opinions. Recognizing the potential far-reaching effects on homeowners associations throughout the State, the District Court certified a question of great public importance to the Florida Supreme Court, and we filed a notice to invoke the discretionary review of the Florida Supreme Court. On November 2, 2023, the Florida Supreme Court declined to exercise jurisdiction. 
 Following the Florida Supreme Court s decision, we paid million to the plaintiffs during the three months ended December 31, 2023, which included the amount of the trial court s judgment, club membership fees received during the pendency of our appeal, pre-judgment interest and post-judgment interest. We have recorded an accrual for our estimated liability with respect to the plaintiff s legal fees and costs for this matter, which is reflected in our legal accruals as of September 30, 2024 and is not material to our condensed consolidated financial statements. Plaintiffs have also asserted claims for additional pre-judgment interest, for which we believe we have substantial defenses. Hearings on the plaintiffs' claims for additional pre-judgment interest and legal fees were held on July 2, 2024 and July 29, 2024, respectively, and remain under the court's consideration. 
 
 After reviewing our amenity arrangements in our Florida communities to determine whether such arrangements might subject the Company to liability in light of the outcome of the Solivita litigation described above, we identified one additional community with similar claims. On August 13, 2020, Slade Chelbian, a resident of our Bellalago community in Kissimmee, Florida, filed a purported class action suit against Avatar, AV Homes, Inc. and Taylor Morrison Home Corporation in the Circuit Court of the Ninth Circuit in and for Osceola County, Florida, generally alleging that Avatar cannot earn profits from community members for use of club amenities where membership in the club is mandatory for all residents and failure to pay club membership fees could result in the foreclosure of their homes by Avatar. On February 25, 2022, the court stayed the action pending the resolution of the Solivita litigation. Following the resolution of the Solivita appeal, the court held a case

 Non-GAAP Measures 
 In addition to the results reported in accordance with GAAP, we generally provide our investors with supplemental information relating to: (i) adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per common share, (ii) adjusted income before income taxes and related margin, (iii) adjusted home closings gross margin; (iv) EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA and (v) net homebuilding debt to capitalization ratio. 
 
 Adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per common share and adjusted income before income taxes and related margin are non-GAAP financial measures that reflect net income/(loss), excluding to the extent applicable in a given period, the impact of inventory or land impairment charges, impairment of investment in unconsolidated entities, pre-acquisition abandonment charges, gain/loss on land transfers to joint ventures, extinguishment of debt, net, and legal reserves or settlements the Company deems not to be in the ordinary course of business and in the case of adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per common share, the tax impact due to such items. Adjusted home closings gross margin is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as GAAP home closings gross margin (which is inclusive of capitalized interest), excluding inventory impairment charges. 
 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures that measure performance by adjusting net income before allocation to non-controlling interests to exclude, interest expense/(income), net, amortization of capitalized interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), and non-cash compensation expense, inventory or land impairment charges, impairment of investments in unconsolidated entities, pre-acquisition abandonment charges, gain/loss on land transfers to joint ventures, extinguishment of debt, net, and legal reserves or settlements that the Company deems not to be in the ordinary course of business, in each case, as applicable in a given period. 
 
 Net homebuilding debt to capitalization ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure we calculate by dividing (i) total debt, plus unamortized debt issuance cost/(premium), net, and less mortgage warehouse facilities borrowings, net of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents net homebuilding debt ), by (ii) total capitalization (the sum of net homebuilding debt and total stockholders equity). 
 Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our performance on a consolidated basis, as well as the performance of our regions, and to set targets for performance-based compensation. We also use the net homebuilding debt to capitalization ratio as an indicator of overall leverage and to evaluate our performance against other companies in the homebuilding industry. In the future, we may include additional adjustments in the above-described non-GAAP financial measures to the extent we deem them appropriate and useful to management and investors. 
 We believe adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per common share and adjusted income before income taxes and related margin as well as EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are useful for investors in order to allow them to evaluate our operations without the effects of various items we do not believe are characteristic of our ongoing operations or performance and also because such metrics assist both investors and management in analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of our business. Adjusted EBITDA also provides an indicator of general economic performance that is not affected by fluctuations in interest rates or effective tax rates, levels of depreciation or amortization, or unusual items. Because we use net homebuilding debt to capitalization ratio to evaluate our performance against other companies in the homebuilding industry, we believe this measure is also relevant and useful to investors for that reason. We believe that adjusted home closings gross margin is useful to investors because it allows investors to evaluate the performance of our homebuilding operations without the varying effects of items or transactions we do not believe are characteristic of our ongoing operations or performance. 
 These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, the comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures of our operating performance or liquidity. Although other companies in the homebuilding industry may report similar information, their definitions may differ. We urge investors to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate similarly-titled non-GAAP financial measures before comparing their measures to ours. 
 
 A reconciliation of (i) adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per common share, (ii) adjusted income before income taxes and related margin, (iii) adjusted home closings gross margin, (iv) EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, and (v) net homebuilding debt to capitalization ratio to the comparable GAAP measures is presented below.

 Net sales orders increased 9.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to our East and Central regions as a result of new community openings. The decrease in the West was primarily driven by traditional seasonality with lower sales in the summer months as well as community close-outs. Net sales orders increased 13.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year due to strong sales in the first quarter of 2024 as a result of fewer cancellations and improved buyer confidence. Average selling prices decreased for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in the prior year as a result of a decrease in option and lot premium revenues in certain markets as well as product mix.

 (1) Cancellation rate represents the number of canceled sales orders divided by gross sales orders. 
 The total company cancellation rate decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in the prior year. We believe the decrease in cancellations is due to improved buyer confidence as a result of stabilizing macro economic factors such as mortgage interest rates and inflation.

 (1) Sales order backlog represents homes under contract for which revenue has not yet been recognized at the end of the period (including homes sold but not 
 yet started). Some of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies including mortgage loan approval and buyers selling their existing 
 homes, which can result in cancellations. 
 Total sold homes in backlog and total sales value decreased by 7.0 and 6.5 at September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease in units in the East is primarily due to improved cycle times in the current year as well as the prior year backlog including homes relating to the opportunistic bulk sale transactions to real estate investors. The decrease in backlog units in the Central region is due to the closeout of certain high volume communities and improved cycle times. The increase in backlog units in the West is due to an improvement in the cancellation rate coupled with strong sales in the first half of the year in certain master planned communities and other recent community openings. In addition, we had more Quick Move-In homes which sold and closed during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which further contributed to the decrease in company-wide sales order backlog.

 The number of homes closed increased by 28.6 and 12.3 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in the prior year, respectively. The increases are generally due to improved sales pace and cycle times. In addition, the West region had several master plan communities that began closing homes during the current year periods. Average selling price decreased company-wide as a result of home closings mix and a decrease in option revenue and lot premium revenue in certain markets for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in the prior year. Despite the decrease in average selling price, home closings revenue, net increased company-wide for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in the prior year as a result of the increase in homes closed being greater than the decrease in average selling price.

 We generally purchase land and lots with the intent to build and sell homes. However, in some locations where we act as a developer, we occasionally purchase land that includes commercially zoned parcels or areas designated for school or government use, which we typically sell to commercial developers or municipalities, as applicable. We also sell residential lots or land parcels to manage our land and lot supply on larger tracts of land. Land and lot sales occur at various intervals and varying degrees of profitability. Therefore, the revenue and gross margin from land closings will fluctuate from period to period, depending upon market opportunities and our land management strategy. Land closings revenue in the West for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was mainly due to lot sales in one of our Portland markets. Land closings revenue in the Central region for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to land sales in our Texas markets. The prior year included lots sales in certain Florida markets within our East region.

 Consolidated home closings gross margin increased 170 basis points to 24.8 from 23.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 40 basis points to 24.2 from 23.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in the prior year. The decreases in the East and Central region are primarily a result of closing product mix. In addition, a decrease in lot premium and option revenue as well as an increase in finance incentives at the time of closing further contributed to the changes in home closings gross margin for the East and Central regions. The increase in the West region is due to closing product mix and a decrease in incentives and discounts. In addition, the West region was negatively impacted by an impairment charge in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Financial Services 
 The following is a summary for the periods presented of our financial services income before income taxes as well as supplemental data:

 Total financial services revenue increased by 24.0 and 24.3 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in the prior year. These increases are a result of a 33 and 21 increase, respectively, in mortgage originations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in the prior year. In addition, the revenue earned on the sale of loans also increased in the current year periods compared to the prior year periods. 
 
 Sales, Commissions and Other Marketing Costs 
 Sales, commissions and other marketing costs, as a percentage of home closings revenue, net, decreased to 5.8 from 6.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by the increase in home closings revenue, net as well as leverage in controllable sales and marketing costs. Sales, commissions and other marketing costs, as a percentage of home closings revenue, net, increased to 6.0 from 5.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to an increase in external commissions costs and advertising costs in an effort to maintain sales traffic.

 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses as a percentage of home closings revenue, net, decreased to 4.0 from 4.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to the increase in home closings revenue, net as well as leverage in fixed general and administrative costs. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of home closings revenue, net, increased to 4.2 from 3.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll related expenses. 
 Net Income from Unconsolidated Entities 
 Net income from unconsolidated entities was 0.7 million and 6.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 1.9 million and 7.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease in net income from unconsolidated entities is primarily due to new joint ventures which experienced start-up expenses prior to having the opportunity to generate income. 
 Interest Expense/(Income), Net 
 Interest expense, net was 3.4 million and 7.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, while interest income, net was 5.8 million and 12.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase in interest expense, net was primarily due to a decrease in interest income earned on our outstanding cash balance as well as increase in the amount of non-capitalizable interest expense relating to land banking arrangements. 
 Other (Income)/Expense, Net 
 Other income, net was 3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and other expense, net was 3.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The other income, net in the current period was primarily related to the change in estimate for our estimated development liabilities. Other expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily related to legal costs. Other expense, net was 3.0 million and 6.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, which is primarily related to an increase in self-insurance reserves. 
 Income Tax Provision 
 The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 24.4 and 24.3 , respectively, compared to 25.4 and 24.7 for the same periods in 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to state income taxes, credits related to homebuilding activities, non-deductible executive compensation, and excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. 
 
 Our income tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was lower than the same period last year primarily due to increased credits related to homebuilding activities. 
 Net Income 
 Net income and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 251.1 million and 2.37 , respectively. Net income and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was 170.7 million and 1.54 , respectively. The increases in net income and diluted earnings per share from the prior year were primarily attributable to higher home closings revenue, net and higher gross margin dollars.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity 
 We finance our operations through the following: 
 Cash generated from operations; 
 Borrowings under our 1 Billion Revolving Credit Facility; 
 Our various series of senior notes; 
 Mortgage warehouse facilities; 
 Project-level real estate financing (including non-recourse loans, land banking, and joint ventures); and 
 Performance, payment and completion surety bonds, and letters of credit. 
 
 Cash flows for each of our communities depend on the status of the development cycle and can differ substantially from reported earnings. Early stages of development or expansion require significant cash expenditures for land acquisitions, on and off-site development, construction of model homes, general landscaping and other amenities. Because these costs are a component of our inventory and are not recognized in our statement of operations until a home closes, we incur significant cash outflows prior to recognition of earnings. 
 Substantially all of our cash currently on deposit with major financial institutions exceeds insured limits. We limit exposure relating to our short-term financial instruments by diversifying these financial instruments among various counterparties, which consist of major financial institutions. Generally, deposits may be redeemed on demand and are maintained with financial institutions with reputable credit. 
 The table below summarizes our total cash and liquidity as of the dates indicated (in thousands):

 (2) During the three months ended September 30, 2024 , the 100 Million Revolving Credit Facility matured. 
 
 We believe we have adequate capital resources from cash generated from operations and sufficient access to external financing sources under our 1 Billion Revolving Credit Facility to conduct our operations for the next twelve months. Beyond the next twelve months, our primary demand for funds will be for payments of our long-term debt as it becomes due, land purchases, lot development, home and amenity construction, long-term capital investments, investments in our joint ventures, payments of ongoing operating expenses, including income taxes, and repurchases of our common stock. We believe we will generate sufficient cash from our operations to meet the demands for such payments, however we may also access the capital markets to obtain additional liquidity through debt and equity offerings or refinance debt to secure capital for such long-term demands. As part of our operations, we may also from time to time purchase our outstanding debt or common stock through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Purchases or retirement of debt and/or purchases of common stock, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. 
 Cash Flow Activities 
 Operating Cash Flow Activities 
 Our net cash used in operating activities was 228.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 550.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in cash used in operating activities is primarily due to an increase spend in real estate inventory and land deposits as well as an increase in our mortgage loans held for sale, partially offset by an increase in net income and accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities. 
 Investing Cash Flow Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 82.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 94.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to an increase in net distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities.

Financing Cash Flow Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 239.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 568.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the prior year including a 350 million repayment of senior notes. 
 Debt Instruments 
 For information regarding our debt instruments, including the terms governing our senior notes and our 1 Billion Revolving Credit Facility, see Note 7 - Debt to the unaudited Condensed consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements as of September 30, 2024 
 Investments in Land Development and Homebuilding Joint Ventures or Unconsolidated Entities 
 We participate in strategic land development and homebuilding joint ventures with related and unrelated third parties. Our participation with these entities, in some instances, enables us to acquire land to which we could not otherwise obtain access, or could not obtain access on terms that are as favorable. Our partners in these joint ventures historically have been land owners/developers, other homebuilders, and financial or strategic partners. Joint ventures with land owners/developers have given us access to sites owned or controlled by our partners. Joint ventures with other homebuilders have provided us with the ability to bid jointly with our partners for large or expensive land parcels. Joint ventures with financial or strategic partners have allowed us to combine our homebuilding expertise with access to our partners capital. 
 In certain of our unconsolidated joint ventures, the joint ventures enter into loan agreements, whereby we or one of our subsidiaries will provide the joint venture lenders with customary guarantees, including completion, indemnity and environmental guarantees subject to usual non-recourse terms. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, total cash investments of capital into unconsolidated joint ventures were 74.6 million and 47.8 million, respectively. 
 Land Option Contracts and Land Banking Agreements 
 We are subject to the usual obligations associated with entering into contracts (including land option contracts and land banking arrangements) for the purchase, development, and sale of real estate in our routine business. We have a number of land purchase option contracts and land banking agreements, generally through cash deposits, for the right to purchase land or lots at a future point in time with predetermined terms. We do not have title to the property and the creditors of the property owner generally have no recourse to the Company. Our obligations with respect to such contracts are generally limited to the forfeiture of the related non-refundable cash deposits and/or letters of credit provided to obtain the options. The aggregate purchase price for land under these contracts was 1.8 billion and 1.5 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Seasonality 
 Our business is seasonal. We have historically experienced, and in the future expect to continue to experience, variability in our results on a quarterly basis. We generally have more homes under construction, close more homes and have greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of the year. Therefore, although new home contracts are obtained throughout the year, a higher portion of our home closings occur during the third and fourth calendar quarters. Our revenue therefore may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis, and we must maintain sufficient liquidity to meet short-term operating requirements. Factors expected to contribute to these fluctuations include: 
 the timing of the introduction and start of construction of new projects; 
 the timing of sales; 
 the timing of closings of homes, lots and parcels; 
 the timing of receipt of regulatory approvals for development and construction; 
 the condition of the real estate market and general economic conditions in the areas in which we operate; 
 mix of homes closed; 
 construction timetables; 
 the cost and availability of materials and labor; and 
 weather conditions in the markets in which we build.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 As a result of seasonal activity, our quarterly results of operations and financial position are not necessarily representative of the results we expect for the full year. 
 
 Inflation 
 We and the homebuilding industry in general may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation, primarily because of higher land, financing, labor and construction material costs. In addition, higher mortgage interest rates can significantly affect the affordability of mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers. We attempt to pass through to our buyers increases in our costs through increased sales prices. However, during periods of soft housing market conditions, we may not be able to offset our cost increases with higher selling prices. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to those disclosed in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our operations are interest rate sensitive. We monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and incur both fixed rate and variable rate debt. At September 30, 2024, approximately 89 of our debt was fixed rate and 11 was variable rate. None of our market sensitive instruments were entered into for trading purposes. For fixed rate debt, changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument, but not our earnings or cash flows. Conversely, for variable rate debt, changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument but may affect our future earnings and cash flows, and may also impact our variable rate borrowing costs, which principally relate to any borrowings under our 1 Billion Revolving Credit Facility and to borrowings by TMHF under its various mortgage warehouse facilities. As of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under our 1 Billion Revolving Credit Facility. We had approximately 945.8 million of additional availability for borrowings under such facility including 145.8 million of additional availability for letters of credit as of September 30, 2024 (giving effect to 54.2 million of letters of credit outstanding as of such date). 
 Our mortgage warehouse facilities agreements as well as our 1 Billion Revolving Credit Facility use SOFR as the basis for determining interest rates. Given the limited history of this rate and potential volatility as compared to other benchmark or market rates, the future performance of this rate cannot be predicted based on historical performance. The consequences of using SOFR could include an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness. 
 We are required to offer to purchase all of our outstanding senior unsecured notes, as described in Note 8 - Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report, at 101 of their aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest upon the occurrence of specified change of control events. Other than in those circumstances, we do not have an obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity and, as a result, we would not expect interest rate risk and changes in fair value to have a significant impact on our cash flows related to our fixed rate debt until such time as we are required to refinance, repurchase or repay such debt. 
 The following table sets forth principal payments by scheduled maturity and effective weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value of our debt obligations as of September 30, 2024. The interest rate for our variable rate debt represents the interest rate on our mortgage warehouse facilities. Because the mortgage warehouse facilities are secured by certain mortgage loans held for sale which are typically sold within approximately 20 - 30 days, its outstanding balance is included as a variable rate maturity in the most current period presented. 
 Expected Maturity Date (In millions, except percentage data) 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter Total Fair Value Fixed Rate Debt 104.9 148.6 103.5 570.6 470.1 519.2 1,916.9 1,932.9 Weighted average interest rate (1) 
 2.8 2.8 2.8 5.4 5.5 5.5 5.0 Variable Rate Debt (2) 
 233.3 233.3 233.3 Weighted average interest rate 6.7 6.7 
 (1) Represents the coupon rate of interest on the full principal amount of the debt. 
 (2) Based upon the amount of variable rate debt outstanding at September 30, 2024, and holding the variable rate debt balance constant, each 1 increase in interest rates would increase the interest incurred by us by approximately 2.3 million per year.
