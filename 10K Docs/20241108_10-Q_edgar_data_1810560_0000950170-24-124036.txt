 per share (the Minimum Bid Price Requirement ). Normally, a company would be afforded a 180-calendar day period to demonstrate compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. However, pursuant to Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A)(iv) the Company is not eligible for any compliance period specified in Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) because the Company effected one or more reverse stock splits over the prior two-year period with a cumulative ratio of shares or more to . Separate from and in addition to the Minimum Bid Price Delist Letter, as previously disclosed, on August 14, 2024, the Company received a letter (the Stockholders Equity Requirement Deficiency Letter and together with the Minimum Bid Price Delist Letter, the Nasdaq Letters from the Staff of Nasdaq notifying the Company that it was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1), which requires the Company to maintain a minimum of in stockholders equity for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market (the Stockholders Equity Requirement ), nor is it in compliance with either of the alternative listing standards, market value of listed securities of at least million or net income of from continuing operations in the most recently completed fiscal year, or in two of the three most recently completed fiscal years. The Minimum Bid Price Delist Letter stated that the Company s Stockholders Equity Requirement Deficiency serves as an additional basis per Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(d)(2) for delisting the Company s securities from The Nasdaq Stock Market and that at a hearing in connection with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, the Nasdaq Hearings Panel Panel will consider the Company s Stockholders Equity Requirement Deficiency as well. By virtue of the Company s financing activities during the third quarter, the Company satisfied the Stockholders Equity Requirement as of September 30, 2024. The Company intends to take all reasonable measures available to regain compliance under the Nasdaq Listing Rules and remain listed on Nasdaq. The Company has the right to appeal the Minimum Bid Price Delist Letter by requesting a hearing before an independent panel, which it filed on October 23, 2024. The hearing request stayed any suspension or delisting action pending the conclusion of the hearing process and the expiration of any additional extension period granted by the panel following the hearing. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will receive any extension by Panel and will ultimately regain compliance with all applicable requirements for continued listing. Neither the Nasdaq Letters nor the Company s noncompliance have an immediate effect on the listing or trading of the Company s common stock or warrants, which will continue to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbols REVB and REVBW, respectively.

million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of million, a stockholders equity of million and available cash and cash equivalents of million. The Company expects to continue to incur significant operating and net losses, as well as negative cash flows from operations, for the foreseeable future as it continues to complete all necessary product development or future commercialization efforts. The Company has never generated revenue and does not expect to generate revenue from product sales unless and until it successfully completes development and obtains regulatory approval for GEM-AKI, GEM-CKD, GEM-PSI or other product candidates, which the Company expects will not be for at least several years, if ever. The Company does not anticipate that its current cash and cash equivalents balance will be sufficient to sustain operations within one-year after the date that the Company s unaudited financial statements for September 30, 2024 were issued, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. To continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, to raise additional capital resources. The Company plans to seek additional funding through public or private equity or debt financings. The Company may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all. The terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of the Company s stockholders. If the Company is unable to obtain funding, it could be required to delay, reduce or eliminate research and development programs, product portfolio expansion or future commercialization efforts, which could adversely affect the Company s business operations. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for September 30, 2024, have been prepared on the basis that the Company will continue as a going concern, and does not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the possible inability for the Company to continue as a going concern. Basis of Presentation The accompanying financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). All inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

shares of its common stock (collectively, the Class D Common Stock Existing Warrants ), to exercise their warrants at a reduced exercise price of per share, in exchange for the Company s agreement to issue new warrants for (the Class E Common Stock Warrants) as described below. The aggregate net proceeds from the exercise of the Class D Common Stock Existing Warrants and the payment of the Class E Common Stock Warrants, as described below, was million. The reduction of the exercise price of the Class D Common Stock Existing Warrants and the issuance of the Class E Common Stock Warrants (the Warrant Inducement was structured as an at-market transaction under Nasdaq rules. In consideration for the immediate exercise of the Class D Common Stock Existing Warrants for cash and the payment of per Class E Common Stock Warrants, the exercising holders received Class E Common Stock Warrants for each Class D Common Stock Existing Warrant in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). The Class E Common Stock Warrants are exercisable for a period of into an aggregate of up to shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share. In connection with the Warrant Inducement, the Company entered into a financial advisory services agreement, dated August 21, 2024, with Roth, pursuant to which the Company agreed to pay Roth a cash fee of for its services, in addition to reimbursement for certain expenses. The shares of common stock issued from the exercise of the Class D Common Stock Existing Warrants were registered pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1, as amended (File No. 333-276232), which was declared effective by the SEC on January 31, 2024. The Class E Common Stock Warrants offered in the private placement were not registered under the Securities Act or applicable state securities laws as of the issuance date, however, as part of the transaction, the Company filed a resale registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC on September 03, 2024, which was declared effective on September 12, 2024. The Holders collectively exercised an aggregate of Class D Common Stock Existing Warrants. As a result of the exercises of the Class D Common Stock Existing Warrants, the Company issued an aggregate of shares of its common stock. The Class E Common Stock Warrants closed on August 22, 2024 with the Company receiving net cash proceeds of approximately million consisting of gross cash proceeds of million, less cash equity issuance costs of approximately million. Note that while all Class D Common Stock Existing Warrants were exercised upon the closing of the Warrant Inducement, certain shares were held in abeyance until September 20, 2024, due to the holders exercise limitations. As of September 30, 2024, all underlying shares were issued and there were no shares held in abeyance as of the end of the reporting period that need to be considered. The lowering of the exercise price of the Class D Common Stock Existing Warrants is considered a warrant modification under the guidance of ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity ASC 815-40 . In addition, the warrant modification is consistent with the equity issuance classification under that guidance as the reason for the warrant modification was to induce the Holders of the Class D Common Stock Existing Warrants to a cash exercise. As pursuant to the guidance of ASC 480 and ASC 815 the Class D Common Stock Existing Warrants were classified as equity instruments before and after the warrant modification. The Company recognized the effect of the warrant modification of approximately million as a non-cash equity issuance cost netted against the additional paid-in capital recognized from the associated warrant exercises. The amount of the non-cash equity issuance cost recognized for the warrant modification used the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the incremental fair value of the modified Class D Common Stock Existing Warrants immediately before and after the warrant modification (see Note 10). Additionally, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, the Class E Common Stock Warrants issued in connection with the Warrant Inducement are treated as equity and the Company recognized approximately million as a non-cash equity issuance cost netted against the additional paid-in capital (see Note 10). Total cash and non-cash equity issuance costs recognized in the Class D Common Stock Existing Warrants modification and the issuance of the Class E Common Stock Warrants of million include cash equity issuance costs of million and non-cash equity issuance costs of approximately million.

Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of shares of the Company s common stock. In determining the expected term of stock options, the Company uses the simplified method. Under this method, the expected term is presumed to be the midpoint between the average vesting date and the end of the contractual term. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield for a period consistent with the expected term of the stock options in effect at the time of the grants. The dividend yield assumption is based on the expectation of no future dividend payments by the Company. In addition to assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model, the Company reduces stock-based compensation expense based on actual forfeitures in the period that each forfeiture occurs.

T he warrants were exercisable immediately upon issuance, provide for a cash, cashless exercise right or an alternative cashless exercise right for shares of common stock per Class C Common Stock Warrant and expire on . The Company evaluated the Class C Common Stock Warrants under ASC 815-40 and concluded that they do not meet the criteria to be classified in stockholders equity and accounted for the Class C Common Stock Warrants as current liabilities. The Company concluded that the multiplier of shares of common stock per Class C Common Stock Warrant used in the alternative cashless exercise precludes the Class C Common Stock Warrants from being considered indexed to the Company s stock. The Company recorded the Class C Common Stock Warrants as current liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value, with subsequent changes in their respective fair values recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations at each reporting date. Estimating fair values of liability-classified financial instruments requires the development of estimates that may, and are likely to, change over the duration of the instrument with related changes in internal and external market factors. In addition, option-based techniques are highly volatile and sensitive to changes in the trading market price of the Company s common stock. Because liability-classified financial instruments are initially and subsequently carried at fair value, the Company s financial results will reflect the volatility in these estimate and assumption changes. Changes in fair value are recognized as a component of other (expense) income in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. At the date of issuance, the Company valued the Class C Common Stock Warrants using a Monte-Carlo simulation model with a fair value of million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has received notices of alternative cashless exercises for Class C Common Stock Warrants issued in connection with the February 2023 Public Offering for shares of common stock.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 
 You should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our unaudited financial statements and the notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q or our Annual Report Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, particularly under the Risk Factors and Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors Summary sections. 
 
 Overview 
 
 Revelation is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on harnessing the power of trained immunity for the prevention and treatment of disease by developing and commercializing therapeutics that modulate the innate immune system. We are developing a pipeline of potential high-value products based on Gemini. Gemini is our proprietary formulation of PHAD an established TLR4 agonist that can stimulate the human body s innate immune response to prevent and treat disease. Our current Gemini based programs consist of: GEM-AKI, which is being developed as a potential therapy for the prevention and treatment of acute kidney injury as a result of cardiac surgery; GEM-CKD, which is being developed as a potential therapy for the prevention and treatment of chronic kidney disease; and GEM-PSI, which is being developed for the prevention and treatment of post surgical infection. 
 
 Since our inception, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to organizing and staffing our Company, business planning, raising capital, and research and development of GEM-AKI, GEM-CKD and GEM-PSI, our product candidates. 
 
 We have funded our operations since our inception to September 30, 2024 through the issuance and sale of our capital stock, from which we have raised net proceeds of 53.0 million. Our current cash and cash equivalents balance will not be sufficient to complete all necessary product development or future commercialization efforts. We anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents balance will not be sufficient to sustain operations within one-year after the date that our unaudited financial statements for September 30, 2024 were issued, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 We plan to seek additional funding through public or private equity or debt financings. We may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all. The terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders. If we are unable to obtain funding we could be required to delay, reduce or eliminate research and development programs, product portfolio expansion or future commercialization efforts, which could adversely affect our business operations. 
 
 We have incurred recurring losses since our inception, including a net loss of 13.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 we had an accumulated deficit of 38.8 million. We expect to continue to generate operating losses and negative operating cash flows for the foreseeable future if and as we: 
 continue the research and development of our product candidates; 

initiate clinical studies for, or preclinical development of, our product candidates; 

further develop and refine the manufacturing processes of our product candidates; 

change or add manufacturers or suppliers of product candidate materials; 

seek regulatory and marketing authorizations for any of our product candidates that successfully complete development; 

acquire or license other product candidates, technologies or biological materials; 

make milestone, royalty or other payments under future license agreements; 

obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property portfolio; 

seek to attract and retain new and existing skilled personnel; 

create additional infrastructure to support our operations as a public company and incur increased legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses; and 

experience delays or encounter issues with any of the above. 

22 

Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending on the timing of our clinical studies and our expenditures on other research and development activities. 
 
 We have never generated revenue and do not expect to generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for GEM-AKI, GEM-CKD, GEM-PSI or other product candidates, which we expect will not be for at least several years, if ever. Accordingly, until such time as we can generate significant revenue from sales of GEM-AKI, GEM-CKD, GEM-PSI or other product candidates, if ever, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings or other capital sources, including potential collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. 
 
 Recent Developments 
 
 2024 Reverse Stock Split 
 
 On January 25, 2024, the Company effected a 1-for-30 reverse stock split of our outstanding shares of common stock, which had been approved at a special meeting of stockholders. 
 NASDAQ Compliance 
 As previously reported, on October 16, 2024, the Company received the Minimum Bid Price Delist Letter from the Staff of Nasdaq, notifying the Company that it was not in compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. 
 Normally, a company would be afforded a 180-calendar day period to demonstrate compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. However, pursuant to Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A)(iv) the Company is not eligible for any compliance period specified in Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) because the Company effected one or more reverse stock splits over the prior two-year period with a cumulative ratio of 250 shares or more to one. 
 Separate from and in addition to the Minimum Bid Price Delist Letter, as previously disclosed, on August 14, 2024, the Company received the Stockholders Equity Requirement Deficiency Letter from the Staff of Nasdaq notifying the Company that it was not in compliance with the Stockholders Equity Requirement, nor is it in compliance with either of the alternative listing standards, market value of listed securities of at least 35 million or net income of 500,000 from continuing operations in the most recently completed fiscal year, or in two of the three most recently completed fiscal years. The Minimum Bid Price Delist Letter stated that the Company s Stockholders Equity Requirement Deficiency serves as an additional basis per Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(d)(2) for delisting the Company s securities from The Nasdaq Stock Market and that at a hearing in connection with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, the Panel will consider the Company s Stockholders Equity Requirement Deficiency as well. By virtue of the Company s financing activities during the third quarter, the Company satisfied the Stockholders Equity Requirement as of September 30, 2024. 
 The Company intends to take all reasonable measures available to regain compliance under the Nasdaq Listing Rules and remain listed on Nasdaq. The Company has the right to appeal the Minimum Bid Price Delist Letter by requesting a hearing before an independent panel, which it filed on October 23, 2024. The hearing request stayed any suspension or delisting action pending the conclusion of the hearing process and the expiration of any additional extension period granted by the panel following the hearing. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will receive any extension by Panel and will ultimately regain compliance with all applicable requirements for continued listing. Neither the Nasdaq Letters nor the Company s noncompliance have an immediate effect on the listing or trading of the Company s common stock or warrants, which will continue to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbols REVB and REVBW, respectively.

Research and Development 
 
 Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of our product candidates GEM-AKI, GEM-CKD and GEM-PSI. Our research and development expenses consist primarily of external costs related to clinical development, costs related to contract research organizations, costs related to consultants, costs related to acquiring and manufacturing clinical study materials, costs related to contract manufacturing organizations and other vendors, costs related to the preparation of regulatory submissions, costs related to laboratory supplies and services, and personnel costs. Personnel and related costs consist of salaries, employee benefits and stock-based compensation for personnel involved in research and development efforts. 
 
 We expense all research and development expenses in the periods in which they are incurred. We accrue for costs incurred as the services are being provided by monitoring the status of specific activities and the invoices received from our external service providers. We adjust our accrual as actual costs become known. 
 
 We expect our research and development expenses to increase substantially for the foreseeable future as we continue the development of GEM-AKI, GEM-CKD and GEM-PSI and continue to invest in research and development activities. The process of conducting the necessary clinical research and product development to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time consuming, and the successful development of GEM-AKI, GEM-CKD and GEM-PSI and any future product candidates is highly uncertain. To the extent that our product candidates continue to advance into larger and later stage clinical studies, our expenses will increase substantially and may become more variable. 
 
 The actual probability of success for GEM-AKI, GEM-CKD and GEM-PSI or any future product candidate may be affected by a variety of factors, including the safety and efficacy of our product candidates, investment in our clinical programs, manufacturing capability and competition with other products. As a result, we are unable to determine the timing of initiation, duration and completion costs of our research and development efforts or when and to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of GEM-AKI, GEM-CKD and GEM-PSI or any future product candidate. 
 
 General and Administrative 
 
 Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, expenses for outside professional services, including financial advisory, legal, human resource, audit and accounting services and consulting costs. Personnel and related costs consist of salaries, employee benefits and stock-based compensation for personnel involved in executive, finance and other administrative functions. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase for the foreseeable future as we increase the size of our administrative function to support the growth of our business and support our continued research and development activities. We also anticipate increased expenses as we continue to operate as a public company, including increased expenses related to financial advisory services, audit, legal, regulatory, investor relations costs, director and officer insurance premiums associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements. 
 
 Other (Expense) Income, Net 
 
 Other (expense) income, net primarily consists of the change in fair value of warrant liability, clinical trial related expenses, foreign currency transaction gains and losses, interest expense and interest income from our cash balances in savings accounts.

Research and development expenses decreased by 0.8 million, from 1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 1.1 million in other program expenses, offset by increases of 0.2 million in clinical study expenses related to GEM-AKI and GEM-PSI and 0.1 million in personnel expenses. Other program expenses include pre-clinical costs and clinical preparation costs primarily for programs GEM-AKI and GEM-PSI. 
 Research and development expenses decreased by 0.1 million, from 3.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 2.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to decreases of 1.6 million in other program expenses and 0.4 million in manufacturing expenses, offset by increases of 1.4 million in clinical study expenses related to GEM-AKI and GEM-PSI and 0.5 million in personnel expenses. Other program expenses include pre-clinical costs and clinical preparation costs primarily for programs GEM-AKI and GEM-PSI.

General and administrative expenses decreased by 0.2 million, from 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to an increase of 0.2 million in legal and professional fees. 
 
 General and administrative expenses increased by less than 0.1 million, from 3.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to increases of 0.5 million in personnel expenses, offset by a decrease of 0.4 million in legal and professional fees. 
 
 25 

Other (Expense) Income, Net 
 
 Other (expense) income, net was 149,521 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, related to the change in fair value of the warrant liability, foreign currency transaction gains and losses, and interest income from our cash balances in savings accounts. Other (expense) income, net was 444,879) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, related to expense in connection with the deferred underwriting commissions, the change in fair value of the warrant liability, foreign currency transaction gains and losses, and interest income from our cash balances in savings accounts. 
 
 Other (expense) income, net was 8,413,423 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, related to the change in fair value of the warrant liability, foreign currency transaction gains and losses, and interest income from our cash balances in savings accounts. Other (expense) income, net was 7,091,596) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily related to the LifeSci judgment expense, reimbursement of costs, clinical trial related settlement expenses with A-IR (defined in Part II-Other Information, Item 1. Leegal Proceedings) and expense in connection with the deferred underwriting commissions, offset by interest income from our cash balances in savings accounts. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Since our inception to September 30, 2024, we have funded our operations from the issuance and sale of our common stock, preferred stock and warrants, from which we have raised net proceeds of 53.0 million, of which 9.1 million was received during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had available cash and cash equivalents of 6.5 million and an accumulated deficit of 38.8 million. 
 
 Our use of cash is to fund operating expenses, which consist primarily of research and development expenditures related to our therapeutic product candidates, GEM-AKI, GEM-CKD and GEM-PSI. We plan to increase our research and development expenses substantially for the foreseeable future as we continue the clinical development of our current and future product candidates. At this time, due to the inherently unpredictable nature of product development, we cannot reasonably estimate the costs we will incur and the timelines that will be required to complete development, obtain marketing approval, and commercialize our current product candidate or any future product candidates. For the same reasons, we are also unable to predict when, if ever, we will generate revenue from product sales or any future license agreements which we may enter into or whether, or when, if ever, we may achieve profitability. Clinical and preclinical development timelines, the probability of success, and development costs can differ materially from expectations. In addition, we cannot forecast the timing and amounts of milestone, royalty and other revenue from licensing activities, which future product candidates may be subject to future collaborations, when such arrangements will be secured, if at all, and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements. 
 
 We expect to continue to generate substantial operating losses for the foreseeable future as we expand our research and development activities. We will continue to fund our operations primarily through utilization of our current financial resources and through additional raises of capital. 
 
 To the extent that we raise additional capital through partnerships or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our product candidates, future revenue streams or research programs or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we raise additional capital through public or private equity offerings, the ownership interest of our then-existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our stockholders rights. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, we may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or suspend one or more of our clinical studies or preclinical studies, research and development programs or commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market our product candidates even if we would otherwise prefer to develop and market such product candidates ourselves. 
 
 Going Concern 
 
 We have incurred recurring losses since our inception, including a net loss of 13.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024 we had an accumulated deficit of 38.8 million, a stockholders equity of 2.7 million and available cash and cash equivalents of 6.5 million. We expect to continue to incur significant operating and net losses, as well as negative cash flows from operations, for the foreseeable future as we continue to complete all necessary product development or future commercialization efforts. We have never generated revenue and do not expect to generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for GEM-AKI, GEM-CKD, GEM-PSI or other product candidates, which we expect will not be for at least several years, if ever. We do not anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents balance will be sufficient to sustain operations within one-year after the date that our unaudited financial statements for September 30, 2024 were issued, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 26 

To continue as a going concern, we will need, among other things, to raise additional capital resources. We plan to seek additional funding through public or private equity or debt financings. We may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all. The terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders. If we are unable to obtain funding we could be required to delay, reduce or eliminate research and development programs, product portfolio expansion or future commercialization efforts, which could adversely affect our business operations. 
 
 The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for September 30, 2024, have been prepared on the basis that we will continue as a going concern, and do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the possible inability for us to continue as a going concern.

Net Cash Used in Operating Activities 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 14.6 million, which consisted of a net loss of 13.3 million and a net change of 1.3 million in our net operating assets and liabilities. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in operating activities was 5.3 million, which consisted of a net income of 2.1 million, offset by a net change of 8.1 million comprised of the change in fair value of the warrant liability, stock-based compensation expense and depreciation expense. 
 Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities consisted of a purchase of lab equipment. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, there was no cash used in investing activities. 
 
 Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was 9.2 million, from net proceeds of 5.4 million received in connection with the February 2024 Public Offering, 0.2 million received from exercises of the Class D Common Stock Warrants and net proceeds of 3.5 million received in connection with the Warrant Inducement. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was 14.0 million, from the February 2023 Public Offering. 
 
 Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments

We have entered into an operating lease for laboratory space in San Diego, California. The table above includes future minimum lease payments under the non-cancelable lease arrangement. 
 
 We enter into contracts in the normal course of business with third party service providers and vendors. These contracts generally provide for termination on notice and, therefore, are cancellable contracts and not considered contractual obligations and commitments. We believe that our non-cancelable obligations under these agreements are not material. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. 
 
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk 
 
 We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 Our cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of highly liquid investments in money market funds and cash on hand and have an original maturity date of 90 days or less. The fair value of our cash and cash equivalents would not be significantly affected by either an increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short-term nature of these instruments. 
 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 
 Our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies in which our operations are located, which is primarily in the United States, England and Australia. We make payments to vendors for research and development services with payments denominated in foreign currencies including Australian Dollars and British Pounds. We are subject to foreign currency transaction gains or losses on our payments denominated in foreign currencies. To date, foreign currency transaction gains and losses have not been material and we have not had a formal hedging program with respect to foreign currency; however, we may consider doing so in the future. A 10 increase or decrease in currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on our financial results. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 
 
 Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenue and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are based on management s best estimates and judgment. Management regularly evaluates its estimates and assumptions using industry experience and other factors; however, actual results could differ materially from these estimates and could have an adverse effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements, we believe that the accounting policies discussed below are most critical to understanding and evaluating our historical and future performance. 
 
 28 

Research and Development Expenditures 
 
 We record accrued expenses for estimated preclinical and clinical study and research expenses related to the services performed but not yet invoiced pursuant to contracts with research institutions, contract research organizations and clinical manufacturing organizations that conduct and manage preclinical studies, and clinical studies, and research services on our behalf. Payments for these services are based on the terms of individual agreements and payment timing may differ significantly from the period in which the services were performed. Our estimates are based on factors such as the work completed, including the level of patient enrollment. We monitor patient enrollment levels and related activity to the extent reasonably possible and make judgments and estimates in determining the accrued balance in each reporting period. Our estimates of accrued expenses are based on the facts and circumstances known at the time. If we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services, our actual expenses could differ from our estimates. As actual costs become known, we adjust our accrued expenses. To date, we have not experienced significant changes in our estimates of clinical study accruals. 
 
 Stock-based Compensation 
 
 We recognize the compensation expense related to stock options, third-party warrants, and RSU awards granted, based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant. The fair value of employee stock options and third-party warrants are generally determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model using various inputs, including estimates of historic volatility, term, risk-free rate, and future dividends. The grant date fair value of the stock-based awards, which have graded vesting, is recognized using the straight-line method over the requisite service period of each stock-based award, which is generally the vesting period of the respective stock-based awards. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, there were 94 Rollover RSU awards unvested and unissued and 946 stock options outstanding. 
 
 Determination of the Fair Value of Common Stock 
 
 Prior to the Business Combination, given the absence of a public trading market for our shares of common stock, our board of directors exercised its judgment and considered a number of objective and subjective factors to determine the best estimate of the fair value of our shares of common stock, including timely valuations of our shares of common stock prepared by an unrelated third-party valuation firm, important developments in our operations, sales of common stock and convertible preferred shares, actual operating results and financial performance, the conditions in the biotechnology industry and the economy in general, the stock price performance and volatility of comparable public companies, and the lack of liquidity of our shares of common stock, among other factors. After the Business Combination, the fair value of each share of common stock is based on the closing price of our shares of common stock as reported on the date of grant. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 See Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for more information about recent accounting pronouncements, the timing of their adoption, and our assessment, to the extent we have made one yet, of their potential impact on our financial condition of results of operations. 
 
 JOBS Act Accounting Election 
 
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. 
 
 We have elected to use this extended transition period to enable us to comply with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements and our interim condensed financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. 
 29 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of such date are effective at the reasonable assurance level. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and our management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 
 On February 18, 2022, LifeSci Capital LLC LifeSci filed an action against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York seeking damages in the amount of approximately 5.3 million plus interest for unpaid banking and advisory fees. These fees arise under contracts which were entered into prior to the business combination (the Business Combination with Petra Acquisition Petra and the Company asserted that LifeSci Capital LLC was not entitled to the fee because it violated its responsibilities by misrepresenting to Petra the funds that would be available following the Business Combination, absent which Petra would not have entered into the Business Combination Agreement. Also as previously reported, on December 1, 2023 a Magistrate Judge issued a report recommending summary judgment in favor of LifeSci Capital LLC. On August 1, 2024 the District Court judge entered an order adopting the Magistrate Judge s report and granted the summary judgment and issued a judgment, including interest, totaling 7.3 million. Following the issuance of the judgment, LifeSci, filed a motion for reimbursement of costs in the amount of 0.2 million. 1.5 million of the judgment relates to deferred underwriting commissions from the Petra initial public offering, which was recorded previously in the financial statements as a current liability, the remaining 5.8 million and 0.2 million reimbursement of costs, has been expensed through the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. On August 12, 2024, the Company received a release and paid the summary judgment in full, including interest and attorney s fees, totaling 7.5 million. A satisfaction of judgment was filed with the court on August 23, 2024. As a result, no further action can be taken against the Company in connection with or relating to the Judgment, and the Company has been released from any and all claims, including the Judgment. 
 On September 27, 2022, A-IR Clinical Research Ltd. A-IR filed a claim against the Company in the High Court of Justice, in the Business and Property Courts of England and Wales, seeking 1.6 million in unpaid invoices, plus interest and costs, relating to the Company s viral challenge study. The Company had disputed the claim because many of the invoices relate to work that was not performed and A-IR had misrepresented its qualifications to perform the contracted work. On April 26, 2024 the parties settled the claim and the proceedings were withdrawn with prejudice. 
 
 30 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Our business is subject to various risks, including those described below and in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 If Revelation is not able to comply with the applicable continued listing requirements or standards of Nasdaq, Nasdaq could delist our common stock. 
 The Company s common stock and Public Warrants are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbols REVB and REVBW, respectively. 
 On October 16, 2024, the Company received the Minimum Bid Price Delist Letter from the Staff of Nasdaq notifying the Company that it was not in compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. Separate from and in addition to the Minimum Bid Price Delist Letter, as previously disclosed, on August 14, 2024, the Company received the Stockholders Equity Requirement Deficiency Letter from the Staff of Nasdaq notifying the Company that it was not in compliance with the Stockholders Equity Requirement, nor is it in compliance with either of the alternative listing standards, market value of listed securities of at least 35 million or net income of 500,000 from continuing operations in the most recently completed fiscal year, or in two of the three most recently completed fiscal years. By virtue of the Company s financing activities during the third quarter, the Company satisfied the Stockholders Equity Requirement as of September 30, 2024; however, Nasdaq may require the Company demonstrate its ability to meet the Stockholder s Equity Requirement through December 31, 2025. 
 The Company intends to take all reasonable measures available to regain compliance under the Nasdaq Listing Rules and remain listed on Nasdaq. The Company has the right to appeal the Nasdaq Letters by requesting a hearing before an independent panel, which it filed on October 23, 2024. The hearing request stayed any suspension or delisting action pending the conclusion of the hearing process and the expiration of any additional extension period granted by the panel following the hearing. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will receive any extension by the hearing panel and will ultimately regain compliance with all applicable requirements for continued listing. If Nasdaq delists the Company s common stock or Public Warrants from trading on its exchange for failure to meet the listing standards such as the Stockholders Equity Requirement or Minimum Bid Price Requirement, we and our stockholders could face significant material adverse consequences including: 
 limited availability of market quotations for our securities; 

reduced liquidity for Revelation s securities; 

a determination that the Company s common stock is a penny stock which will require brokers trading in the Company s common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for Revelation s securities; 

a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and 

a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. 

In the event a reverse stock split is required to maintain the Minimum Bid Price Requirement for continued listing on Nasdaq, the Company intends to undertake such a reverse stock split. Even if a reverse stock split is effected, there can be no assurance that the market price of the Company s common stock will maintain the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. The market price of our common stock will continue to be based, in part, on our performance and other factors unrelated to the number of shares outstanding.
