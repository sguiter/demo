included in the Units being offered, the Public Shares ), generating gross proceeds of which is described in
Note 3. 

The
Initial Public Offering transaction costs amounted to consisting of of underwriting fees paid in cash, 
of deferred underwriting fees payable (which are held in a trust account with Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company acting as
trustee (the Trust Account )), funded to the trust account and of costs related to the Initial Public
Offering. Cash of was held outside of the Trust Account on February 11, 2022 and was available for working capital purposes.
As described in Note 6, the deferred underwriting fees are contingent upon the consummation of the Business Combination. 

Simultaneously
with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the private sale (the Private Placement of an
aggregate of units (the Private Placement Units to Evergreen LLC (the Sponsor at a purchase price
of per Private Placement Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company in the amount of . 

On
February 11, 2022, the underwriters purchased an additional Option Units pursuant to the exercise of the over-allotment option.
The Option Units were sold at an offering price of per Unit, generating additional gross proceeds to the Company of .
Also, in connection with the full exercise of the over-allotment option, the Sponsor purchased an additional Option Private Placement
Units at a purchase price of per unit. 

Following
the closing of the Initial Public Offering on February 11, 2022, an amount of per Unit) from the net proceeds of
the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement was placed in a trust account Trust Account which may be invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ), with a maturity of 185 days or less or in any open-ended investment company
that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act,
as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the Trust
Account, as described below. 

The
Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering
and the sale of Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward
consummating a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully.
The Company must complete one or more initial Business Combinations with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market
value equal to at least of the value of the net assets held in the Trust Account (as defined below) (excluding the deferred underwriting
commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the Trust Account). The Company will only complete a Business Combination if
the post transaction company owns or acquires or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a
controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment
Company Act. Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering, management has agreed that an amount equal to at least per Unit
sold in the Initial Public Offering, including proceeds of the Private Placement Warrants, will be held in the Trust Account and invested
only in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of
185 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting
certain conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion
of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the funds held in the Trust Account, as described below. 

Note
1 Description of Organization and Business Operations (Continued) 

The
Company will provide the holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem
all or a portion of their Public Shares either (i) in connection with a shareholders meeting called to approve the Business Combination
or (ii) by means of a tender offer in connection with the Business Combination. The decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder
approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company. The Public Shareholders will be entitled to
redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially anticipated to be per Public
Share, plus any pro rata interest then in the Trust Account, net of taxes payable). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion
of a Business Combination with respect to the Company s warrants. The Public Shares subject to redemption will be recorded at a
redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering in accordance with the Accounting
Standards Codification ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity . 

If
the Company seeks shareholder approval of the Business Combination, the Company will proceed with a Business Combination if a majority
of the outstanding shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination, or such other vote as required by law or stock exchange
rule. If a shareholder vote is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements and the Company does not decide
to hold a shareholder vote for business or other reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its second amended and restated certificate of
incorporation (the Certificate of Incorporation ), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. 

If,
however, shareholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements, or the Company
decides to obtain shareholder approval for business or other reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy
solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If the Company seeks shareholder approval in connection
with a Business Combination, the Sponsor has agreed to vote its Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5) and any Public Shares purchased
during or after the Public Offering in favor of approving a Business Combination. Additionally, each Public Shareholder may elect to
redeem their Public Shares without voting, and if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. 

Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if the Company seeks shareholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the
tender offer rules, the Certificate of Incorporation will provide that a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder
or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more
than an aggregate of of the Public Shares, without the prior consent of the Company. 

The
holders of the Founder Shares have agreed (a) to waive their redemption rights with respect to the Founder Shares and Public Shares held
by them in connection with the completion of a Business Combination and (b) not to propose an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation
(i) to modify the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to allow redemptions in connection with a Business Combination
or to redeem of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period (as defined
below) or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders rights or pre-business combination activity, unless
the Company provides the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment. 

Note
1 Description of Organization and Business Operations (Continued) 

If
the Company has not completed a Business Combination within 12 months (or 15 months, or 18 months, as applicable from the closing of
the Initial Public Offering (the Combination Period ), the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose
of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a
per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the
funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to pay taxes (less up to of interest to pay dissolution expenses),
divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Shareholders rights
as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible
following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s remaining shareholders and the Company s board of directors,
dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors
and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Company s
warrants, which will expire worthless if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. 

The
holders of the Founders Shares have agreed to waive their liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails
to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the holders of Founder Shares acquire Public Shares in
or after the Initial Public Offering, such Public Shares will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if the
Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to
their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination
within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will
be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value
of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the Initial Public Offering price per Unit ). 

Moreover, in the event that an
executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability
for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account
due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except for the Company s independent registered
accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the
Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. 

Subsequent
to the approval by the shareholders of Evergreen Corporation EVGR or the Company) of the Amendment to EVGR s Amended
and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (the Charter Amendment ), on July 18, 2023, EVGR filed the Charter
Amendment with the Registrar of Companies in the Cayman Islands. Pursuant to the Charter Amendment, EVGR has the right to extend the
period which it has to complete a business combination by up to twelve (12) times for an additional one (1) month each time from August
11, 2023 to August 11, 2024 by depositing into its trust account, for each one-month extension, the lesser of (a) and (b) 
for each Class A ordinary share outstanding after giving effect to the redemption of public shares in connection with the Charter Amendment
in accordance with the terms of EVGR s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. In connection with the Charter
Amendment, EVGR shareholders elected to redeem an aggregate of ordinary shares. 

Subsequent
to the approval by the shareholders of EVGR of the Amendment to EVGR s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association
(the Charter Amendment ), on May 9, 2024, EVGR filed the Charter Amendment with the Registrar of Companies in the
Cayman Islands. Pursuant to the Charter Amendment, EVGR has the right to extend the period which it has to complete a business combination
by up to nine (9) times for an additional one (1) month each time from May 11, 2024 to February 11, 2025 by depositing into its trust
account, for each one-month extension, the lesser of (a) and (b) for each Class A ordinary share outstanding after giving
effect to the redemption of public shares in connection with the Charter Amendment in accordance with the terms of EVGR s amended
and restated memorandum and articles of association. EVGR s shareholders elected to redeem an aggregate of ordinary shares
or in connection with the Charter Amendment. 

On
September 5, 2024, Evergreen Corporation EVGR or the Company entered into the Merger Agreement, which was subsequently amended and restated on September 18, 2024 by and among
EVGR, Evergreen Merger Corporation, a Cayman Islands exempted company and wholly owned subsidiary of EVGR PubCo ), Evergreen
Merger Sub Inc. Merger Sub ), a company limited by shares registered in the British Virgin Islands and a wholly-owned subsidiary
of PubCo, Forekast Limited., a company limited by shares registered in the British Virgin Islands Forekast ), and Forekast
International Sdn. Bhd., a company organized under the laws of Malaysia and a wholly owned subsidiary of Forekast FISB ).
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Business Combination will be effected in two steps: (i) EVGR will reincorporate in the Cayman Islands
by merging with and into PubCo, with PubCo remaining as the surviving publicly traded entity (the Reincorporation Merger 
(ii) after the Reincorporation Merger, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Forekast, resulting in Forekast being a wholly owned subsidiary
of PubCo (the Acquisition Merger and together with the Reincorporation Merger, the Business Combination ).
In connection with the consummation of the Business Combination, EVGR will be renamed Forekast Group. 

The
aggregate consideration for the Acquisition Merger is , payable in the form of newly issued PubCo Ordinary Shares
(the Closing Payment Shares valued at per share to Forekast and its shareholders. At the closing of the Acquisition
Merger (the Closing ), the issued and outstanding shares in Forekast held by the former Forekast shareholders will be cancelled
and cease to exist, in exchange for the issuance of the Closing Payment Shares. 

Note
1 Description of Organization and Business Operations (Continued) 

Going
Concern and Management s Plan 

The
Company expects to incur significant costs in pursuit of its acquisition plans and will not generate any operating revenues until after
the completion of its initial business combination. In addition, the Company expects to have negative cash flows from operations as it
pursues an initial business combination target. In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in
accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern the Company does not currently have adequate liquidity to sustain operations, which consist
solely of pursuing a Business Combination. 

The
Company may raise additional capital through loans or additional investments from the Sponsor or its shareholders, officers, directors,
or third parties. The Company s officers and directors and the Sponsor may, but are not obligated to (except as described above),
loan the Company funds, from time to time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet the Company s
working capital needs. 

As
is customary for a special purpose acquisition company, if the Company is not able to consummate a Business Combination during the Combination
Period, it will cease all operations and redeem the Public Shares. Management plans to continue its efforts to consummate a Business
Combination during the Combination Period. 

While
the Company expects to have access to additional sources of capital if necessary, there is no current commitment on the part of any financing
source to provide additional capital and no assurances can be provided that such additional capital will ultimately be available. The
liquidity condition and mandatory liquidation raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern
until the earlier of the consummation of the Business Combination or the date the Company is required to liquidate. There is no assurance
that the Company s plans to raise additional capital (to the extent ultimately necessary) or to consummate a Business Combination
will be successful or successful within the Combination Period. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result
from the outcome of this uncertainty.

of at least of the issued and outstanding shares after the Proposed Public Offering. 

Only
holders of the Class B ordinary shares will have the right to vote on the election of directors prior to the Business Combination. Holders
of Class A ordinary shares and holders of Class B ordinary shares will vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a
vote of our shareholders except as otherwise required by law. In connection with our initial business combination, we may enter into
a shareholders agreement or other arrangements with the shareholders of the target or other investors to provide for voting or other
corporate governance arrangements that differ from those in effect upon completion of our initial public offering. 

The
Class B ordinary shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares at the time of a Business Combination, or earlier at
the option of the holder, on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment. In the case that additional Class A ordinary shares, or equity-linked
securities, are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts issued in the Initial Public Offering and related to the closing of
a Business Combination, the ratio at which Class B ordinary shares shall convert into Class A ordinary shares will be adjusted (unless
the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding Class B ordinary shares agree to waive such adjustment with respect to any such issuance
or deemed issuance) so that the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of all Class B ordinary shares will equal,
in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20 of the sum of the total number of all ordinary shares outstanding upon the completion
of Initial Public Offering plus all Class A ordinary shares and equity-linked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with a
Business Combination (net of the number of Class A ordinary shares redeemed in connection with a Business Combination), excluding any
shares or equity-linked securities issued or issuable to any seller of an interest in the target to us in a Business Combination. 

Warrants
 Public Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation
of the Units and only whole warrants will trade. The Public Warrants will become exercisable on the later of (a) 30 days after the completion
of a Business Combination and (b) 12 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering. The Public Warrants will expire 
after the completion of a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. 

The
Company will not be obligated to deliver any Class A ordinary shares pursuant to the exercise of a warrant and will have no obligation
to settle such warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the Class A ordinary
shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is then effective and a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares is
available, subject to the Company satisfying its obligations with respect to registration, or a valid exemption from registration is
available. No warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and the Company will not be obligated to issue any shares
to holders seeking to exercise their warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under
the securities laws of the state of residence of the exercising holder, or an exemption from registration is available. 

The
Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 business days after the closing of a Business Combination,
the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to file, and within 60 business days following a Business Combination to have
declared effective, a registration statement covering the issuance of the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants
and to maintain a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares until the warrants expire or are redeemed. Notwithstanding
the above, if the Class A ordinary shares is at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such
that it satisfies the definition of a covered security under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, the Company may, at
its option, require holders of Public Warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a cashless basis in accordance with
Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event the Company so elects, the Company will not be required to file or maintain in
effect a registration statement, but will use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable
blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available.

price and number of ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including
in the event of a share dividend, extraordinary dividend or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, except
as described below, the Public Warrants will not be adjusted for issuances of ordinary shares at a price below its exercise price. Additionally,
in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the Public Warrants. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination
within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of Public Warrants will not receive
any of such funds with respect to their Public Warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company s assets held
outside of the Trust Account with respect to such Public Warrants. Accordingly, the Public Warrants may expire worthless.

Overview 

We
are a blank check company formed under the laws of the Cayman Islands on October 21, 2021. We were formed for the purpose of entering
into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination
with one or more target businesses. While our efforts to identify a target business may span many industries and regions worldwide, we
focus on companies with operations in vision sensing technologies. We intend to effectuate our initial Business Combination using cash
from the proceeds of our Initial Public Offering and the private placement of the Private Units, the proceeds of the sale of our shares
in connection with our initial Business Combination, shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders
or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing. 

We
expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our initial Business Combination. We cannot assure you that our plans
to complete our initial Business Combination will be successful.

Results
of Operations 

We
have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities from inception through August 31, 2024
were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for our Initial Public Offering, described below, and, after our Initial Public
Offering, identifying a target company for an initial business combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until
after the completion of our initial business combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable
securities held in the Trust Accounts. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting
and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. 

For
the three months ended August 31, 2024, we had a net income of 544,062, which consists of formation and operating costs of 155,991,
and interest earned on investments held of 700,053. For the nine months ended August 31, 2024, we had a net income of 2,211,977, which
consists of formation and operating costs of 601,741 and interest earned on investment held of 2,813,718. For the three months ended
August 31, 2023, we had a net income of 1,111,904, which consists of formation and operating costs of 247,600, and interest earned
on investments held of 1,359,504. For the nine months ended August 31, 2023, we had a net income of 3,100,901, which consists of formation
and operating costs of 844,959, and interest earned on investments held in the Trust Account of 3,945,860. 

Liquidity,
Capital Resources and Going Concern Consideration 

On
February 11, 2022, we consummated our Initial Public Offering of 11,500,000 Units at a price of 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds
of 115,000,000. Simultaneously with the consummation of the initial public offering, we completed the private placement of an aggregate
of 532,500 units to our sponsor at a purchase price of 10.00 per private placement unit, generating total gross proceeds of 5,325,000. 

For
the nine months ended August 31, 2024, cash used in operating activities was 436,635 and for the nine months ended August 31, 2023,
the cash used in operating activities was 582,992. 

As
of August 31, 2024, we had investments of 54,519,214 held in the Trust Accounts. We intend to use substantially all of the funds held
in the Trust Accounts, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Accounts (less taxes paid and deferred underwriting
commissions) to complete our initial business combination. We may withdraw interest to pay taxes. During the nine months ended August
31, 2024, we did not withdraw any interest earned on the Trust Accounts. To the extent that our capital stock or debt is used, in whole
or in part, as consideration to complete our initial business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Accounts will be
used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth
strategies. 

As
of August 31, 2024, we had cash of 50,798 outside of the Trust Accounts. We intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Accounts
primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and
from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents
and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete our initial business combination. 

In
order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with our initial business combination, our Sponsor
or an affiliate of our Sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required.
If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that our initial business combination
does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Accounts to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds
from our Trust Accounts would be used for such repayment. Up to 1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into units identical to the
Placement Units, at a price of 10.00 per unit at the option of the lender. As of August 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023, the company
has borrowed 990,500 and 650,000 under working capital loan respectively. The Company transferred 121,000 for extension purpose
on January 5, 2024. 

We
believe we will need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditure required for operating our business. If our
estimate of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating our initial business combination
are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our initial
business combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our initial business combination or because
we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our Public Shares upon consummation of our initial business combination, in which
case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination. Subject to compliance with applicable
securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our initial business combination. If we
are unable to complete our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to
cease operations and liquidate the Trust Accounts. In addition, following our initial business combination, if cash on hand is insufficient,
we may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations.

In
connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, the liquidity condition
and mandatory liquidation raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern until the earlier
of the consummation of the Business Combination or the date the Company is required to liquidate. 

These
financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities
that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Financing Arrangements 

We
have no obligations, assets or liabilities which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements. We do not participate in transactions
that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which
would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. 

We
have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or
commitments of other entities, or entered into any non-financial agreements involving assets.
