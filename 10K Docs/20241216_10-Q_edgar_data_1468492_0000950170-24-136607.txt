our ability to meet our expectations regarding the commercial supply of our current products and any future products; 

our ability to retain key executives;

the overall global economic environment; 

the ultimate impact of health epidemics, on our business, our clinical trials, our research programs, healthcare system or the global economy as a whole;

 split (the Reverse Stock Split of its outstanding shares of Common Stock, with an effective date of May 17, 2024. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every shares of the Company's issued and outstanding pre-reverse split Common Stock were combined into one share of Common Stock, except to the extent that the Reverse Stock Split resulted in any of the Company's shareholders owning a fractional share, which was rounded up to the next highest whole share. In connection with the Reverse Stock Split, there was no change in the par value per share of . As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, equitable adjustments corresponding to the Reverse Stock Split ratio will be made to the Company s outstanding warrants and upon the exercise or vesting of all stock options such that every one hundred shares of Common Stock that may be issued upon the exercise of the warrants and stock options held immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split will represent one share of Common Stock that may be issued upon exercise of such warrants and stock options immediately following the Reverse Stock Split. Correspondingly, the exercise price per share of Common Stock attributable to the warrants and stock options immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split will be proportionately increased by a multiple of 100 following the Reverse Stock Split. All Common Stock share and per share data, and exercise price data for applicable Common Stock equivalents, included in these financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to give effect to the Reverse Stock Split for all periods presented, unless otherwise indicated. 

 million and million, respectively. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. In March 2023, the Company entered into a purchase agreement and a registration rights agreement with an institutional investor, providing for the sale, from time to time at the discretion of the Company, of up to million of the Company s common stock, par value per shares Common Stock ), over the thirty-six month term of the purchase agreement (the Equity Line ). As of October 31, 2024, the Company has issued and sold an aggregate shares of Common Stock, including commitment shares, under the Equity Line and received proceeds of approximately million (see Note 5). Subsequent to October 31, 2024 and

shares of Common Stock under the Equity Line, receiving proceeds of approximately . In September 2023, the Company entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the EDA with an institutional investor, pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell an aggregate of up to million of its shares of Common Stock in at-the-market offerings ATM Facility ). In November 2023, the EDA was further amended increasing the aggregate amount of Common Stock that may be sold under the ATM Facility from million to up to million. The Company is eligible to sell up to approximately million worth of shares of Common Stock as the aggregate market value of the Company's shares of Common Stock eligible for sale under the EDA is subject to limitations of General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3 until such time that the Company's public float equals or exceeds million. In the event the aggregate market value of the Company s outstanding Common Stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds million, then the one-third limitation on sales set forth in General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3 shall not apply to additional sales made pursuant to the EDA. From inception through October 31, 2024 , the Company has issued and sold an aggregate shares of Common Stock and received net proceeds of approximately million, a fter banker fees, legal fees and other costs under the ATM Facility (see Note 5). In September 2024, the Company entered into a note purchase agreement (the Note Purchase Agreement with Streeterville Capital, LLC, an accredited investor Streeterville ), pursuant to which the Company issued to Streeterville an unsecured promissory note in the original principal amount of (the Streeterville Note ). The Streeterville Note carried an OID of and was withheld from the Streeterville Note for reimbursement of Streeterville's transaction expenses. Additionally, the Company incurred debt financing costs of . As a result, the Company received aggregate net proceeds of approximately million in connection with the issuance of the Streeterville Note. (see Note 4). Based on the Company s business plan assumptions and expected cash burn rate, management believes that current resources would be insufficient to fund operations for the next twelve months following the issuance of these financial statements. Additionally, the FDA can delay, limit or deny clearance of a medical device for many reasons outside the Company s control which may involve substantial unforeseen costs. Management s plans include raising capital through the sale of additional equity securities, debt, or capital inflows from strategic partnerships. Management can provide no assurance that such financing or strategic relationships will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, which would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company and its financial statements. The condensed unaudited financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period.

Inventory consists mainly of raw materials and components used in the current hardware build of the MyoVista wav ECG devices and components are used for research and development purposes and device sales, which to date have been in international markets as sale of the MyoVista wav ECG in the U.S. is subject to FDA clearance. Management believes that its hardware platform is in final form, however, prior to FDA clearance and market acceptance of the MyoVista wav ECG, further hardware changes could be necessary which could have an impact on net realizable values. The majority of the Company s current inventory is intended for use to build finished products following regulatory clearance. Finished products do not contain materials that would degrade significantly over the useable life of the device and are considered to have a useable life of over . Existing inventory related to finished devices are planned to be updated to the latest hardware revision and specifically allocated to a limited distribution for field reliability studies and are not slated for general purpose sales. The Company periodically evaluates inventory and makes specific write-offs and provides an allowance for inventory that is considered obsolete due to hardware and or software related changes. If the Company does not receive FDA clearance and/or obtain market acceptance of the MyoVista wav ECG, the Company could have further material write-downs of inventory due to obsolescence in excess of the amount currently reserved.

to days. Payment terms fall within the one-year guidance for the practical expedient which allows the Company to forgo adjustment of the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component. The Company accepts product returns at its discretion or if the product is defective as manufactured. Historically, the actual product returns have been immaterial to the Company s financial statements. The Company elected to treat shipping and handling costs as a fulfillment cost and included them in the cost of goods sold as incurred. Costs associated with product sales include commissions. The Company applies the practical expedient and recognizes commissions as expense when incurred because the expense is incurred at a point in time and the amortization period is less than one year. Commissions are recorded as selling expense. The Company did not recognize material revenues during the three and six month periods ended October 31, 2024 and 2023. The Company s revenues do not require significant estimates or judgments. The Company is not a party to contracts that include multiple performance obligations or material variable consideration. As of October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, the Company did t have any contract assets or liabilities from contracts with customers and there were remaining performance obligations that the Company had not satisfied.

Net Deferred Tax Assets 

For the six months ended October 31, 2024 and the year ended April 30, 2024, the Company s cumulative net operating loss for federal income tax purposes was approximately million and million , respectively. The net operating loss, subject to limitations, may be available in future tax years to offset taxable income. The net operating loss carry-forward will begin to expire in year . Federal and state tax laws impose restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards in the event of a change in ownership as defined by the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"), Section 382. Under Section 382 of the Code, substantial changes in ownership and the ownership of acquired companies may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that are available to offset taxable income. The annual limitation would not automatically result in the loss of net operating loss carryforwards but may limit the amount available in any given future period. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Based upon the projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences, and therefore, a full valuation allowance has been recorded at October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024.

Litigation From time to time, the Company may be subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company does not believe that the outcome of those matters will have a material adverse effect to the financial position, operating results or cash flows. However, there can be no assurance such legal proceedings will not have a material impact. The Company is not aware of any material claims outstanding or pending against the Company as of October 31, 2024. Royalty Agreements In 2013, the Company entered into an agreement Technology Agreement with its founder, conveying ownership of all intellectual property and rights to the Company. As part of that agreement, the Company will make royalty payments, based upon paid MyoVista wav ECG device unit sales, as follows: a) on each of the first 2,400 MyoVista wav ECG devices; and 

 b) on each MyoVista wav ECG device thereafter until royalties total . 

 The royalty obligation has a first priority security interest and pledge on the covered technology (as defined in the Technology Agreement, which essentially is comprised of the intellectual property of the MyoVista wav ECG device) in priority to the debt holders of the Loan and Security Agreement as discussed further in Note 4. Upon (i) the aggregate payment of of royalties; (ii) the Common Stock having a closing quoted share price of per share or more; or (iii) receipt by the Company of a bona fide offer valuing the Common Stock at or more, then the secured interest and pledge shall be released. In the event of a bankruptcy of the Company, any balance of the royalty not paid at that point would accelerate and become an immediately due debt obligation of the Company with the benefit of the secured interest and pledge (if it remained at such time). In December 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with The University Court of The University of Glasgow Glasgow for a non-exclusive license of the Glasgow algorithm interpretive analysis for the conventional ECG trace. The agreement was amended in March 2023 and again in July 2024, and as part of the agreement, the Company is required to make royalty payments, based upon MyoVista wav ECG device unit sales dependent on sale volumes per year, subject to minimum annual fees. To date, such amounts have been expensed to research and development as the Glasgow algorithm has been part of the device development and will form part of the submission for FDA clearance of the MyoVista wav ECG device. Collaboration Agreements Rutgers Collaboration Agreement On November 29, 2022, the Company entered into a multi-year Collaboration Agreement with Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, to develop AI-ECG algorithms for new or improved ECG indications, which is expected to accelerate our product development pipeline and further expand the clinical value of an ECG for low-cost detection of heart disease. Mount Sinai Collaboration Agreement On September 20, 2023, the Company entered into multiple definitive license agreements (each a License Agreement and collectively, the License Agreements with Mount Sinai to commercialize a range of AI cardiovascular algorithms developed by Mount Sinai as well as a memorandum of understanding for ongoing cooperation encompassing de-identified data access, on-going

Ite m 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following discussion and analysis is intended as a review of significant factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations for the periods indicated. The discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited financial statements and the notes presented herein included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited financial statements and the related notes set forth in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The discussion below contains forward-looking statements that are based upon our current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations due to inaccurate assumptions and known or unknown risks and uncertainties, including those identified in Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and under Risk Factors as identified under Part 1, Item 1A of our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Overview 
 We are a medical technology company focused on applying innovative AI-based technology to an ECG, also known as an EKG, to expand and improve an ECG s clinical usefulness. Our objective is to make an ECG a far more valuable cardiac screening tool by expanding its clinical capability to detect a broader range of heart disease conditions through the development of AI-ECG. We are seeking to provide AI-ECG solutions in any care setting worldwide in a manner that best suits different providers, either via our cloud-based application that can receive an upload from one of the millions of ECG devices currently in clinical use or via our proprietary MyoVista wav ECG device. The MyoVista wav ECG, is a resting 12-lead ECG that will incorporate HeartSciences proprietary AI-ECG algorithm designed to provide diagnostic information related to cardiac dysfunction as well as conventional ECG information in the same test. We are also developing a cloud-based platform to host AI-ECG algorithms on an ECG hardware agnostic basis (the MyoVista Insights Cloud Platform ). In the future, we intend to offer a range of AI-ECG algorithms, via each product. Neither the MyoVista wav ECG device, MyoVista Insights Cloud Platform nor any of our AI-ECG algorithms are yet cleared for marketing by the FDA. 
 The AI-ECG algorithms are intended to provide diagnostic information which has traditionally required cardiac imaging. We believe, the combination of a device agnostic cloud platform and MyoVista wav ECG device would allow us to offer AI-ECG solutions across a wide range of healthcare settings from large heath systems to frontline or point of care environments such as primary care. The initial revenue model for the MyoVista wav ECG device, which involves the use of the MyoVista hardware, associated software and consumables for each test, is expected to be razor-razorblade as the cable connection to the electrodes used with the MyoVista wav ECG are proprietary to HeartSciences, and new electrodes are used for every test performed. As further algorithms are made commercially available via the MyoVista wav ECG or the MyoVista Insights Cloud Platform, we would expect to adopt revenue models based on algorithm usage and/or recurring subscriptions. Our MyoVista Insights Cloud Platform is being designed to fit simply into existing clinical workflows and be available to host third party AI-ECG algorithms, which increases its clinical value and our speed to market as well as reducing R D costs associated with internal algorithm development. 
 On September 20, 2023, we entered into the License Agreements with Mount Sinai to commercialize a range of AI-ECG algorithms covering a range of cardiovascular conditions developed by Mount Sinai as well as a memorandum of understanding for ongoing cooperation encompassing de-identified data access, on-going research, and the evaluation of the MyoVista wav ECG device. 
 Our future success is dependent upon receiving FDA clearances for our products and additional funding may be required as part of achieving FDA clearance and thereafter would be required to support the sales launch, provide working capital and support further R D. 
 We believe that there is currently no low-cost, front-line, medical device that is effective at screening broadly for many types of heart disease. As a result, we believe that frontline physicians face a significant challenge in determining if a patient has heart disease. Although many think of the ECG as the frontline test for heart disease, in 2012, the United States Preventive Services Task Force conducted an evaluation of conventional ECG testing and stated: There is no good evidence the test, called an ECG, helps doctors predict heart risks any better than traditional considerations such as smoking, blood pressure and cholesterol levels in people with no symptoms. 
 ECG devices record the electrical signals of a patient s heart. The ECG is a ubiquitous, relatively low-cost, simple and quick test; it is portable and can be performed in a wide range of clinical settings by a non-specialist clinician or clinical aide. There are three basic categories of heart disease: electrical (such as an arrhythmia), structural (such as valvular disease) and ischemic (such as coronary artery disease, or CAD). Conventional resting ECGs have limited sensitivity in detecting structural and ischemic disease and are typically used for diagnosing cardiac rhythm abnormalities, such as atrial fibrillation, or acute coronary syndrome, such as a myocardial infarction which is also known as a heart attack. However, traditional ECGs have a limited role in identifying cardiac dysfunction associated with structural and ischemic disease. 
 HeartSciences has designed or licensed algorithms designed to help address these limitations and extend the clinical capability of an ECG to detect cardiac dysfunction and other heart disease types. 
 20 

Our first AI-ECG algorithm to be incorporated into the MyoVista wav ECG device has been designed by the Company and applies AI-machine learning to the signal processed ECG signal to develop a proprietary algorithm designed to detect impaired cardiac relaxation, or cardiac dysfunction caused by heart disease and/or age-related cardiac dysfunction. We have been adjusting the algorithm to reflect updated echo measurement thresholds in respect of 60-year-old patients. The change was made, and agreed with the FDA, to reflect recent clinical findings which we believe will further increase the clinical value of this algorithm. 
 We expect the first AI-ECG algorithm to be submitted as part of the MyoVista Insights Cloud Platform will be for detection of low ejection fraction, or systolic dysfunction, and based on one of those licensed from Mount Sinai. 
 The editorial comment associated with the study titled Prediction of Abnormal Myocardial Relaxation from Signal Processed Surface ECG presented below discusses recent applications of machine learning to data derived from surface 12-lead ECGs in relation to cardiac dysfunction: 
 These represent some of the most significant advances in electrocardiography since its inception, which has historically had a limited, if any, role in the evaluation of cardiac dysfunction. In the past, our cardiovascular community was resigned to the fact that surface ECGs are poor indicators for cardiac dysfunction. 
 Khurram Nasir, MD, MPH, MSC, Department of Cardiology, Houston Methodist DeBakey Heart Vascular Center, Houston, Texas, et. al., Journal of American College of Cardiology Editorial Comment Volume 76 Number 8 2020. 
 Almost all forms of heart disease, including CAD and structural disease, affect heart muscle, or cardiac function prior to symptoms. Impaired cardiac function is first observed as impaired cardiac relaxation which is an early indicator of diastolic dysfunction and usually continues to increase in severity as heart disease progresses. The diastolic phase of the cardiac cycle occurs when the heart muscle relaxes (following contraction). Diastolic dysfunction may also be related to age-related cardiac dysfunction. Low ejection fraction, or systolic dysfunction, is a later stage of cardiac dysfunction and occurs when the heart pumps a reduced level of blood from the ventricles during contraction. 
 If we receive FDA clearances for our product candidates, our main target markets would be frontline healthcare environments in the U.S., to assist physician decision making in the cardiology referral process. Currently, cardiology referral decisions are often based on a patient s risk factors and/or a conventional ECG test. Accordingly, many patients with heart disease are left undetected while no current treatment or intervention is required for most patients referred for cardiac imaging. We believe that adding the capability to detect a broader range of cardiac conditions to the standard 12-lead resting ECG could help improve cardiac referral pathways and be valuable for patients, physicians, health systems and third-party payors. 
 New Class II devices, such as our products, require FDA premarket review. The MyoVista wav ECG device along with its proprietary software and hardware is classified as a Class II medical device by the FDA. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for these devices is generally accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification process or De Novo classification request, or petition process. We previously submitted an FDA De Novo classification request in December 2019 and, following feedback and communications with the FDA during and since that submission, we have been making modifications to our device, including our proprietary algorithm. We have finished the patient recruitment and core lab work for our FDA validation study and have been undertaking device and algorithm development testing for a revised FDA submission. We had been planning a revised submission under the De Novo pathway, however, in December 2023 the FDA confirmed that we could submit the MyoVista wav ECG device for clearance under the 510(k) pathway following the grant by the FDA in August 2023 of an industry-first De Novo clearance which created a new Class II product code for cardiovascular machine learning-based notification software. This was in respect of a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy algorithm and in late September 2023, the FDA cleared an algorithm for low ejection fraction (less than 40 under the 510(k) pathway using this new product code. Accordingly, we are now preparing for a 510(k) FDA submission and are aiming for a submission in the first calendar quarter of 2025. If successful, FDA clearance would provide us the ability to market and sell the MyoVista wav ECG device in the U.S. and additional funding would be required to support the sales launch of the MyoVista wav ECG device in the U.S., provide working capital and support further R D. 
 To date we have not yet entered into a discussion with the FDA regarding the MyoVista Insights Cloud Platform or Mount Sinai licensed AI-ECG algorithms but we expect these products to fall under the 510(k) pathway and are aiming for an FDA submission of our MyoVista Insights Cloud Platform and low ejection fraction algorithm in the second half of 2025. 
 Recent Developments 
 Corporate Name Change 
 21 

On October 17, 2024, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Formation with the Secretary of State of Texas to change the Company's corporate name to HeartSciences Inc. , with an effective date of October 17, 2024. The Name Change was approved by the Company's shareholders at the Company's Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on January 17, 2024. The Name Change became effective at the open of market on October 23, 2024, and does not affect the Company s ticker symbols or the applicable CUSIP number for the Company s outstanding shares of Common Stock and public warrants. 
 Compliance with Nasdaq Listing Requirements 
 On August 2, 2023, we received a letter from the Staff indicating that, based upon the closing bid price of the Company s Common Stock for the last 30 consecutive business days, the Company no longer met the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. In accordance with Nasdaq listing rules, we had until January 29, 2024 to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. In the event we did not regain compliance during this period, we were eligible to seek an additional 180 calendar day compliance period if we met the Nasdaq continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards, with the exception of the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, and provide written notice to Nasdaq of our intent to cure the deficiency during this second compliance period. 
 We attended an August 17, 2023 hearing before the Nasdaq Hearing Panel (the Panel , and requested the continued listing of its securities on the Nasdaq Capital Market pending our return to compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. 
 On January 30, 2024, we received a letter from the Panel advising that we have been granted an additional 180-day extension to July 29, 2024, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. 
 On May 9, 2024, the Company received a Staff Determination from Nasdaq to delist the Company s securities from the Nasdaq Capital Market. The Staff Determination was issued because, as of May 8, 2024, the Company s Common Stock had a closing bid price of 0.10 or less for at least ten consecutive trading days. Accordingly, the Company is subject to the provisions contemplated under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A)(iii) (the Low Priced Stocks Rule ). 
 On May 17, 2024, the Company effected the Reverse Stock Split, such that a s a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every 100 shares of the Company's issued and outstanding pre-reverse split Common Stock were combined into one share of Common Stock. 
 On June 3, 2024, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq informing the Company that the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications staff has confirmed that the Company has regained compliance with the 1.00 per share minimum bid price requirement pursuant to the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, and that the Company is therefore in compliance with Nasdaq s listing requirements. The Company's Common Stock and public warrants continue to be listed on Nasdaq. 
 Reverse Stock Split 
 On May 6, 2024, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Formation with the Secretary of the State of Texas to effect the Reverse Stock Split of its outstanding shares of Common Stock, with an effective date of May 17, 2024. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, equitable adjustments corresponding to the Reverse Stock Split ratio were made to the Company s outstanding warrants and its other convertible instruments and upon the exercise or vesting of all stock options such that every 100 shares of Common Stock that may be issued upon the exercise of the Company s warrants and stock options and conversion of its other convertible instruments held immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split represent one share of Common Stock that may be issued upon exercise of such warrants and stock options and conversion of the other convertible instruments immediately following the Reverse Stock Split. Correspondingly, the exercise price per share of Common Stock attributable to the Company s warrants and stock options and the conversion price of its other convertible instruments immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split was proportionately increased by a multiple of 100 following the Reverse Stock Split. 
 Patents 
 In May 2024, we were granted a patent from the Indian Patent Office covering MyoVista wavelet technology. 
 In July 2024, we were granted a patent allowance from the United States Patent and Trademark Office for the detection of left ventricular and/or right ventricular dysfunction using deep learning.

Summary of Statements of Operations for the three and six months ended October 31, 2024 compared with the three and six months ended October 31, 2023: 
 There were no revenues for the three and six months ended October 31, 2024. Revenues were 4,000 and cost of sales were 2,000 for the three and six months ended October 31, 2023. Our revenues to date have been mainly generated in the establishment of distributor relationships outside the United States as part of obtaining feedback during product development and improvement of the MyoVista wav ECG. 
 Research and development expenses were 1.2 million and 2.4 million for the three and six months ended October 31, 2024, representing an increase of 442,000, or 58 , and an increase of 1.1 million, or 83 , when compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase is primarily due to consulting costs incurred for development of our MyoVista Insights Cloud Platform and increase in headcount and professional services supporting the FDA submission process. 
 Selling, general, and administrative expenses were approximately 0.8 million and 1.6 million for the three and six months ended October 31, 2024, representing a decrease of 29,000, or 4 , and an increase of 57,000, or 4 , when compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease noted during the three month period is primarily related to reduction in stock compensation expense of 14,000 and reduction of marketing costs and other professional fees of 15,000. The increase noted during the six month period is primarily related to an increase in legal expenses of 82,000 and rent expense of 16,000, offset by reductions in stock compensation expense of 45,000. 
 Interest expense was 118,000 and 140,000 for the three and six months ended October 31, 2024, representing a decrease of 61,000, or 34 , and a decrease of 75,000, or 35 , when compared to the same periods in 2023. Interest expense in Fiscal 2025 is related to interest on the FRV Note and interest and debt service amortization on the Streeterville Note. The JQA Note and related accrued interest converted to equity in November 2023. 
 Other income of 20,000 and 66,000 during the three and six months ended October 31, 2024 is related to interest earned on our cash balances. 
 Liquidity, Capital Resources, and Going Concern Considerations 
 We have incurred losses each year since inception and have experienced negative cash flows from operations in each year since inception. We incurred a net loss of 4.1 million for the period ended October 31, 2024. As of October 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 71.5 million and stockholder's equity of 4.0 million and working capital of 2.4 million. 
 Based on our current business plan assumptions and expected cash burn rate, we believe that the existing cash is insufficient to fund operations for the next twelve months following the issuance of these financial statements. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.

On March 10, 2023, we entered into the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement providing for the purchase, from time to time at our discretion, of up to 15.0 million of our Common Stock, over the 36-month term of the agreement. Actual sales of shares of Common Stock will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time. The net proceeds received from these purchases will depend on the frequency and prices at which we sell shares of our Common Stock to Lincoln Park. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we have received approximately 1.8 million from the sale of Common Stock pursuant to the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement. We expect that any proceeds received from such sales to Lincoln Park will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. 
 On September 18, 2023, we entered into an EDA with Maxim Group LLC as sales agent pursuant to which we may offer and sell up to 3.25 million of our shares of Common Stock in at-the-market offerings. The EDA was further amended on November 9, 2023 and again on November 17, 2023, to increase the amount of shares of Common Stock we may sell to up to 15.0 million. The shares of Common Stock may be issued and sold from time to time through or to the placement agent acting as sales agent or principal pursuant to our shelf registration statement on the Shelf S-3, as filed with the SEC on September 18, 2023. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we have received approximately 9.8 million in net proceeds, after Maxim fees, legal fees and other costs, from the sale of Common Stock pursuant to the amended EDA. We expect that any proceeds received from such sales under the ATM Facility will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes 
 In September 2023, the Company entered into the MSW Note for up to 1.0 million, drawn in installments consisting of (i) 0.25 million on or prior to September 8, 2023, (ii) 0.25 million on or prior to September 20, 2023, and (iii) further drawdowns of up to 0.5 million in such amounts and such times to be mutually agreed upon between the Company and MSW. In September 2023, the Company drew 0.5 million under the MSW Note and in November 2023, the MSW Note was converted into shares of Common Stock. 
 In September 2024, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with Streeterville pursuant to which Streeterville issued the Company an unsecured promissory note in the amount of 2,510,000 which included an original issuance discount of 500,000 and reimbursement of Streeterville's transaction expenses of 10,000. The Company incurred placement agent fees equal to 7 of the gross proceeds received from the sale of the Streeterville Note. The Company received approximately 1.9 million in net cash proceeds from the sale of the Streeterville Note. 
 Our cash requirements are, and will continue to be, dependent upon a variety of factors. We expect to continue devoting significant capital resources to R D, clinical studies and go-to-market strategies. We will need to continue to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities, debt, or capital inflows from strategic partnerships, however we can provide no assurance that that we will be able to consummate the sale of any such securities or strategic relationships will be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. 
 Since our inception, we have raised capital through the public and private sale of debt and equity. As of October 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents balance of approximately 4.1 million, a decrease of 1.8 million from 5.8 million as of April 30, 2024.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from the information provided in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Ite m 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Not required to be provided by a smaller reporting company. 
 Ite m 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company has adopted and maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, is collected, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules of the SEC. The Company's disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon the most recent evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting, our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer) determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of October 31, 2024 as a result of identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. The identified material weaknesses were as follows: (i) lack of proper approval processes and review processes and documentation for such reviews; (ii) we did not maintain sufficient U.S. GAAP and SEC accounting resources commensurate with those required of a public company; and (iii) insufficient number of staff to maintain optimal segregation of duties and levels of oversight. W e have taken and continue to take remedial steps to improve our internal controls over financial reporting, which includes establishing a more robust process related to review of complex accounting transactions, preparation of account reconciliations, and review of journal entries. Our Chief Financial Officer frequently attends continuing education for updates on accounting policies and procedures. We cannot assure you that these measures will significantly improve or remediate the material weaknesses described above. Management is monitoring the effectiveness of these and other processes, procedures and controls and will make any further changes deemed appropriate. We are committed to ensuring that our internal controls over financial reporting are designed and operating effectively. Management believes the foregoing actions will effectively remediate the material weaknesses, however, our material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until controls are in place for a period of time, the controls are tested, and management concludes that the controls are properly designed and operating effectively. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Except as described above with respect to the remediation steps we are taking, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended October 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 CEO and CFO Certifications 
 Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 to this Quarterly Report are the Certifications of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively. These Certifications are required in accordance with Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (the Section 302 Certifications ). This Item 4 of this Quarterly Report, which you are currently reading, is the information concerning the evaluation referred to above and in the Section 302 Certifications and this information should be read in conjunction with the Section 302 Certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented.
