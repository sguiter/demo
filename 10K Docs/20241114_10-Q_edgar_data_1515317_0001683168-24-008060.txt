ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

We use the terms Magellan, we, 
 our, and us to refer to Magellan Copper Gold Inc. (formerly Magellan Gold Corporation). 

The following discussion and analysis provides
information that management believes is relevant for an assessment and understanding of our results of operations and financial condition.
This information should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements, which are included in our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and our interim unaudited financial statements and notes thereto included with this
report in Part I, Item 1. 

Forward-Looking Statements 

Some of the information presented in this Form
10-Q constitutes forward-looking statements . These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements
that include terms such as may, will, intend, anticipate, estimate, 
 expect, continue, believe, plan, or the like, as well as all statements that are
not historical facts. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to
differ materially from current expectations. Although we believe our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds
of our knowledge of our business and operations, there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from expectations. 

All forward-looking statements speak only as of
the date on which they are made. We undertake no obligation to update such statements to reflect events that occur or circumstances that

Overview 

We were incorporated on September 28, 2010, in
Nevada. Our principal business is the acquisition and exploration of mineral resources. We have not presently determined whether the properties
to which we have mineral rights contain mineral reserves that are economically recoverable. 

We have only had limited operations to date, and
we rely upon the sale of our securities and borrowings from significant investors to fund our operations, as we have not generated any
revenue. 

Effective July 1, 2020, Magellan entered into
a stock purchase agreement to acquire Clearwater Gold Mining Corporation Clearwater which owns certain unpatented mining
claims in Idaho County, Idaho that include the historic Center Star Gold Mine near Elk City, Idaho. The Center Star Mine hosts high grade
gold mineralization that was discovered in the early 1900 s. There was periodic historic production and development work done under
different ownership through the 1980s. With the high-grade gold mineralization present, Magellan will be evaluating the historic mine
data to assess the potential to develop a gold resource at Center Star. The project area is located 45 miles from Grangeville, Idaho and
near the town of Elk City, Idaho. 

In consideration for 100 of the issued and outstanding
shares of Clearwater, Magellan has agreed to pay its sole shareholder 1,000,000 shares of Magellan common stock and 150,000 in cash.
The cash consideration of 25,000 was paid and the balance of 125,000 is evidenced by a secured promissory note due in two years. The
Note is secured by the Clearwater shares and assets.

was determined to be 1,000,000 which consisted of 5,000,000 shares of common stock with a fair value of 1,000,000. The Company concluded
the transaction qualified as an asset acquisition and all such acquisition costs have been capitalized. The Company concluded the purchase
of a single set of assets qualified as an asset acquisition and all such acquisition costs have been capitalized as mineral rights and
properties on the balance sheet. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company evaluated the mineral rights and properties for
impairment and recorded an impairment expense of 1,000,000. As of December 31, 2023, the Gold Express mineral rights and properties balance
totaled 0.

of understanding for earn-in agreement( MOU with Gold Express Mines, Inc. Per the MOU, the Company agreed to earn-in for
up to 50 working interest in Kris Project, which has 74 unpatented mining claims located in Plumas County, CA. In March 2023, the Company
paid Gold Express Mines, Inc. 100,000, which was recorded as a deposit, and shall spend 400,000 on the Kris Project in allowable expenditures
over the next thirty-six months, assuming permitting for the work is obtained. If permitting delays the exploration and other work programs,
the earn-in period shall be extended accordingly. Allowable expenditures are sampling, drilling, assaying, geologic mapping, and mine
site improvements made or performed directly on the existing mine site or expanded mine site. Consulting fees for work directly benefiting
the Project are also allowed including management of work, preparation of reports, and planning for Future work. Claim maintenance fees
on the existing claims are also allowable expenditures, as are the costs of future land acquisitions which are deemed to benefit the Kris
Project, and which are approved by both parties beforehand. As part of the agreement, the Company shall make the Bureau of Land Management
claim maintenance fees on the existing claims no later than August 15, 2023, and by August 15 th in ensuing years during the
earn-in period. The Company shall pay for the annual Plumas County notice of intent to hold recording costs and any other
Plumas County fees or taxes which accrue during the earn-in period. These shall all be allowable expenses under the earn-in agreement.
As of December 31, 2023, the 100,000 deposit paid to Golden Express for the MOU was reclassed to mineral rights and properties on the
balance sheet. 

On January 4, 2024 the Company entered into an
asset purchase agreement with Gold Express. Pursuant to the agreement, the Seller sold the following 1) Copper Butte Project located in
Pinal County, Arizona and consisting of 66 unpatented mining claims 2) Blue Jacket Project located in Idaho County, Idaho and consisting
of 79 unpatented mining claims and 3) Copper Cliff Project located in Adams County, Idaho and consisting of 71 unpatented mining claims
and a mineral lease with option to purchase consisting of patented mining claims known as the Copper Cliff Patented Claims located in
Adams County, Idaho upon landowner approval. As of September 30, 2024, the total purchase price for the acquisition for the three projects
was determined to be 422,565, to be paid upon landowner approval, consisting of 5,500,000 shares of common stock for the three projects
with a fair market value of 422,565. As of the date of this filing, the Company and GEM have not completed the assignment of leases and
the 500,000 shares related to assignment have not been issued. The Company concluded the transaction qualified as an asset acquisition
and all costs have been capitalized. The Company concluded the purchase of a single set of assets qualified as an asset acquisition and
all such acquisition costs have been capitalized as mineral rights and properties on the balance sheet. 

Our primary focus is to advance our Center Star
gold project, our Kris gold project and our copper projects, Blue Jacket, Copper Cliff and Copper Butte towards resource definition and
eventual development, and possibly to acquire additional mineral rights and conduct additional exploration, development and permitting
activities. Our permitting applications and exploration and development efforts will require additional capital. We rely upon the sale
of our securities as well as advances and loans from executive management and significant shareholders to fund our operations as we have
not generated any significant revenue.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our unaudited consolidated financial statements
have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that we will be able to meet our obligations and continue our operations during
the next fiscal year. Asset realization values may be significantly different from carrying values as shown in our consolidated financial
statements and do not give effect to adjustments that would be necessary to the carrying values of assets and liabilities should we be
unable to continue as a going concern. At September 30, 2024, we had not yet generated sufficient revenues or achieved profitable operations
and we have accumulated losses of 21,264,782 We expect to incur further losses in the development of our business, all of which raises
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern depends on our ability
to generate future profits and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations arising from normal business operations when
they come due, of which there can be no assurance. 

We anticipate that additional funding will be
in the form of additional loans from officers, directors or significant shareholders, or equity financing from the sale of our common
stock but cannot assure that any future financing will occur.

operating, investing and financing activities is as follows:

ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was 168,899 which was comprised of 252,600 proceeds from sale of
common stock, 21,000 proceeds from notes payable, third parties, which were offset with the repayment of convertible debt of 100,000
and repayment of advances from third parties of 4,701. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have and have never had any off-balance
sheet arrangements. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments
that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements, including the notes thereto. We consider critical accounting policies to
be those that require more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements, including the following:
long lived assets; intangible assets valuations; and income tax valuations. Management relies on historical experience and other assumptions
believed to be reasonable in making its judgment and estimates. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. 

Management believes its application of accounting
policies, and the estimates inherently required therein, are reasonable. These accounting policies and estimates are periodically reevaluated,
and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Not applicable. 

21 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures: 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s SEC rules and forms, and
that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including Michael Lavigne, our Principal Accounting Officer, as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management necessarily applied its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits
of such controls and procedures, which, by their nature, can provide only reasonable assurance regarding management s control objectives. 

Our management, with the participation of our
CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period
covered by this report. Based upon this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
as of such date as a result of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting due to lack of segregation of duties,
a limited corporate governance structure, and lack of a formal review process that includes multiple levels of review as discussed in
Item 9A of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 

While we strive to segregate duties as much as
practicable, there is an insufficient volume of transactions at this point in time to justify additional full time staff. We believe that
this is typical in many exploration stage companies. We may not be able to fully remediate the material weakness until we commence mining
operations, at which time we would expect to hire more staff. We will continue to monitor and assess the costs and benefits of additional
staffing. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting: 

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
