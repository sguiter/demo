 EXPLANATORY NOTE This report combines the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024 of Simon Property Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and Simon Property Group, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to Simon mean Simon Property Group, Inc. and references to the Operating Partnership mean Simon Property Group, L.P. References to we, us and our mean collectively Simon, the Operating Partnership and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by Simon and/or the Operating Partnership. Simon is a real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code. We are structured as an umbrella partnership REIT under which substantially all of our business is conducted through the Operating Partnership, Simon s majority-owned partnership subsidiary, for which Simon is the general partner. As of September 30, 2024, Simon owned an approximate 86.9 ownership interest in the Operating Partnership, with the remaining 13.1 ownership interest owned by limited partners. As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, Simon has exclusive control of the Operating Partnership s day-to-day management. We operate Simon and the Operating Partnership as one business. The management of Simon consists of the same members as the management of the Operating Partnership. As general partner with control of the Operating Partnership, Simon consolidates the Operating Partnership for financial reporting purposes, and Simon has no material assets or liabilities other than its investment in the Operating Partnership. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of Simon and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements. We believe that combining the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q of Simon and the Operating Partnership into this single report provides the following benefits: enhances investors understanding of Simon and the Operating Partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business; eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined presentation since substantially all of the disclosure in this report applies to both Simon and the Operating Partnership; and creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports. 
 We believe it is important for investors to understand the few differences between Simon and the Operating Partnership in the context of how we operate as a consolidated company. The primary difference is that Simon itself does not conduct business, other than acting as the general partner of the Operating Partnership and issuing equity or equity-related instruments from time to time. In addition, Simon itself does not incur any indebtedness, as all debt is incurred by the Operating Partnership or entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership holds, directly or indirectly, substantially all of our assets, including our ownership interests in our joint ventures. The Operating Partnership conducts substantially all of our business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity. Except for the net proceeds from equity issuances by Simon, which are contributed to the capital of the Operating Partnership in exchange for, in the case of common stock issuances by Simon, common units of partnership interest in the Operating Partnership, or units, or, in the case of preferred stock issuances by Simon, preferred units of partnership interest in the Operating Partnership, or preferred units, the Operating Partnership, directly or indirectly, generates the capital required by our business through its operations, the incurrence of indebtedness, proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties and joint ventures and the issuance of units or preferred units to third parties. The presentation of stockholders equity, partners equity and noncontrolling interests are the main areas of difference between the consolidated financial statements of Simon and those of the Operating Partnership. The differences between stockholders equity and partners equity result from differences in the equity issued at the Simon and Operating Partnership levels. The units held by limited partners in the Operating Partnership are accounted for as partners equity in the Operating Partnership s financial statements and as noncontrolling interests in Simon s financial statements. The noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership s financial statements include the interests of unaffiliated partners in various consolidated partnerships. The noncontrolling interests in Simon s financial statements include the same noncontrolling interests at the Operating Partnership level and, as previously stated, the units held by limited partners of the Operating Partnership. Although classified differently, total equity of Simon and the Operating Partnership is the same. To help investors understand the differences between Simon and the Operating Partnership, this report provides: separate consolidated financial statements for Simon and the Operating Partnership; a single set of condensed notes to such consolidated financial statements that includes separate discussions of noncontrolling interests and stockholders equity or partners equity, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and per share and per unit data, as applicable;

Table of Contents 
 a combined Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section that also includes discrete information related to each entity; and separate Part II, Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Use of Proceeds, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities sections related to each entity. 
 This report also includes separate Part I, Item 4. Controls and Procedures sections and separate Exhibits 31 and 32 certifications for each of Simon and the Operating Partnership in order to establish that the requisite certifications have been made and that Simon and the Operating Partnership are each compliant with Rule 13a-14(a) or Rule 15d-14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and 18 U.S.C. 1350. The separate discussions of Simon and the Operating Partnership in this report should be read in conjunction with each other to understand our results on a consolidated basis and how management operates our business. In order to highlight the differences between Simon and the Operating Partnership, the separate sections in this report for Simon and the Operating Partnership specifically refer to Simon and the Operating Partnership. In the sections that combine disclosure of Simon and the Operating Partnership, this report refers to actions or holdings of Simon and the Operating Partnership as being our actions or holdings. Although the Operating Partnership is generally the entity that directly or indirectly enters into contracts and joint ventures, holds assets and incurs debt, we believe that references to we, us or our in this context is appropriate because the business is one enterprise and we operate substantially all of our business through the Operating Partnership.

 wholly-owned properties and additional properties that are less than wholly-owned, but which we control or for which we are the primary beneficiary. We apply the equity method of accounting to the other properties (the joint venture properties) and our investments in Kl pierre, TRG, and our other platform investments. We manage the day-to-day operations of of the joint venture properties, but have determined that our partner or partners have substantive participating rights with respect to the assets and operations of these joint venture properties. Our investments in joint ventures in Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Malaysia, Thailand, Canada, Spain, and the United Kingdom comprise of the remaining properties. These international properties and TRG are managed by joint ventures in which we share control. Preferred distributions of the Operating Partnership are accrued at declaration and represent distributions on outstanding preferred units of partnership interests, or preferred units, and are included in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. We allocate net operating results of the Operating Partnership after preferred distributions to limited partners and to Simon based on the partners respective weighted average ownership interests in the Operating Partnership. Net operating results of the Operating Partnership attributable to limited partners are reflected in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. Simon s weighted average ownership interest in the Operating Partnership was and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Simon s ownership interest in the Operating Partnership was and , respectively. We adjust the noncontrolling limited partners interests at the end of each period to reflect their interest in the net assets of the Operating Partnership.

 million and million, respectively, for which we have elected the measurement alternative. We regularly evaluate these investments for any impairment in their estimated fair value, as well as any observable price changes for an identical or similar equity instrument of the same issuer, and determined that no material adjustment in the carrying value was required for the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Our deferred compensation plan equity instruments are valued based upon quoted market prices. The investments have a matching liability as the amounts are fully payable to the employees that earned the compensation. Changes in value of these securities and changes to the matching liability to employees are both recognized in earnings and, as a result, there is no impact to consolidated net income. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we held debt securities of million and million, respectively, in our captive insurance subsidiary. The types of securities included in the investment portfolio of our captive insurance subsidiary are typically U.S. Treasury or other U.S. government securities as well as corporate debt securities with maturities ranging from less than to . These securities are classified as available-for-sale and are valued based upon quoted market prices or other observable inputs when quoted market prices are not available. The amortized cost of debt securities, which approximates fair value, held by our captive insurance subsidiary is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Changes in the values of these securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the gain or loss is realized or until any unrealized loss is deemed to be other-than-temporary. We review any declines in value of these securities for other-than-temporary impairment and consider the severity and duration of any decline in value. To the extent an other-than-temporary impairment is deemed to have occurred, an impairment is recorded and a new cost basis is established. Our captive insurance subsidiary is required to maintain statutory minimum capital and surplus as well as maintain a minimum liquidity ratio. Therefore, our access to these securities may be limited. investments for which fair value is measured on a recurring basis using Level 3 inputs. We have equity instruments with readily determinable fair values that are valued using Level 1 inputs. We have foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate cap and swap agreements, and time-deposits that mature within one-year that are valued using Level 2 inputs. The notional value of our time-deposits approximate fair value given the relatively short-term nature of the instruments. We also have a bifurcated embedded derivative option that was a component of the million exchangeable bonds issued in November 2023. This instrument is classified as primarily having Level 3 inputs and is further discussed in Note 3, within the Derivative Financial Instruments subsection and in Note 7. - - Deferred costs and other assets - Total - Liabilities: Other Liabilities -

 - - Deferred costs and other assets Total - Liabilities: Other Liabilities - Note 7 includes a discussion of the fair value of debt measured using Level 2 inputs. Notes 3, 4, and 6 include discussions of the fair values recorded in purchase accounting using Level 2 and Level 3 inputs. Level 3 inputs to our purchase accounting and impairment analyses include our estimations of fair value, net operating results of the property, capitalization rates and discount rates. Nonredeemable noncontrolling interests in properties, net Total noncontrolling interests reflected in equity Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (which includes nonredeemable and redeemable noncontrolling interests in consolidated properties, limited partners interests in the Operating Partnership and preferred distributions payable by the Operating Partnership on its outstanding preferred units) is a component of consolidated net income. In addition, the individual components of other comprehensive income (loss) are presented in the aggregate for both controlling and noncontrolling interests, with the portion attributable to noncontrolling interests deducted from comprehensive income attributable to common stockholders. The Operating Partnership Our evaluation of the appropriateness of classifying the Operating Partnership s common units of partnership interest, or units, held by Simon and the Operating Partnership's limited partners within permanent equity considered several significant factors. First, as a limited partnership, all decisions relating to the Operating Partnership s operations and distributions are made by Simon, acting as the Operating Partnership s sole general partner. The decisions of the general partner are made by Simon's Board of Directors or management. The Operating Partnership has no other governance structure. Secondly, the sole asset of Simon is its interest in the Operating Partnership. As a result, a share of common stock of Simon, or common stock, if owned by the Operating Partnership, is best characterized as being similar to a treasury share and thus not an asset of the Operating Partnership. Limited partners of the Operating Partnership have the right under the Operating Partnership s partnership agreement to exchange their units for shares of common stock or cash, as selected by Simon as the sole general partner. Accordingly, we classify units held by limited partners in permanent equity because Simon may elect to issue shares of common stock to limited

The reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) consisted of the following: Interest expense ) ) ) ) Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests The Operating Partnership The total accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to the Operating Partnership s currency translation adjustment was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 million Interest Rate Swaps million Interest Rate Caps million As of December 31, 2023, we had the following outstanding interest rate derivatives related to managing our interest rate risk: 

Number of Notional Interest Rate Derivative Instruments Amount Interest Rate Swaps million Interest Rate Caps million Interest Rate Swaps million Interest Rate Caps million The carrying value of our interest rate swap and cap agreements, at fair value, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was a liability balance of million and an asset balance of million, respectively, and are included in other liabilities and deferred costs and other assets, respectively. Our exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates primarily relates to our long-term debt obligations. We manage exposure to interest rate market risk through our risk management strategy by a combination of interest rate protection agreements to effectively fix or cap a portion of variable rate debt. We may enter into treasury lock agreements as part of an anticipated debt issuance. Upon completion of the debt issuance, the fair value of these instruments that had been recorded as part of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt agreement. The unamortized gain on our treasury locks and terminated hedges recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Within the next 12 months, we expect to reclassify to earnings approximately million of gains related to terminated interest rate swaps from the current balance held in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We are also exposed to foreign currency risk on financings of certain foreign operations. Our intent is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures, with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging these exposures. We do not enter into either interest rate protection or foreign currency rate protection agreements for speculative purposes. We are also exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on financial instruments which are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily in Yen and Euro. We use currency forward contracts, cross currency swap contracts and foreign currency denominated debt to manage our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates on certain Yen and Euro-denominated receivables and net investments. Currency forward contracts involve fixing the Yen:USD or Euro:USD exchange rate for delivery of a specified amount of foreign currency on a specified date. The currency forward contracts are typically cash settled in U.S. dollars for their fair value at or close to their settlement date.

Accordingly, we report the changes in fair value in other comprehensive income (loss). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded gains of million and million, respectively, in the cumulative translation adjustment section of the other comprehensive income (loss). Changes in the value of these instruments are offset by changes in the underlying hedged Euro-denominated joint venture investments. The total accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to Simon s derivative activities, including our share of other comprehensive income (loss) from unconsolidated entities, was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The total accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to the Operating Partnership s derivative activities, including our share of other comprehensive income (loss) from unconsolidated entities, was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The exchange option of our exchangeable bonds is valued as a derivative liability using an option pricing model that incorporates the observed period ending price of the exchangeable bonds and secondary market prices of comparable unsecured senior notes without an exchange feature. The key assumptions utilized are the period ending share-price of Kl pierre, share-price implied volatility, the EUR risk-free rate, Kl pierre expected dividend yield, time to maturity, and the comparable spread to the EUR risk-free rate of unsecured senior notes without an exchange feature. The fair value of the option is recorded in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and changes to the value of the option are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income in unrealized (losses) gains in fair value of publicly traded equity instruments and derivative instrument, net.

 non-recourse mortgage notes secured by mortgages on properties and other assets, including separate pools of cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized mortgages encumbering a total of properties. Under these cross-default provisions, a default under any mortgage included in the cross-defaulted pool may constitute a default under all mortgages within that pool and may lead to acceleration of the indebtedness due on each property within the pool. Certain of our secured debt instruments contain financial and other non-financial covenants which are specific to the properties that serve as collateral for that debt. If the applicable borrower under these non-recourse mortgage notes were to fail to comply with these covenants, the lender could accelerate the debt and enforce its rights against their collateral. At September 30, 2024, the applicable borrowers under these non-recourse mortgage notes were in compliance with all covenants where non-compliance could individually or in the aggregate, giving effect to applicable cross-default provisions, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Fair Value of Debt The carrying value of our variable-rate mortgages and other loans approximates their fair values. We estimate the fair values of consolidated fixed rate mortgages using cash flows discounted at current borrowing rates and other indebtedness using cash flows discounted at current market rates. We estimate the fair values of consolidated fixed rate unsecured notes using quoted market prices, or, if no quoted market prices are available, we use quoted market prices for securities with similar terms and maturities. The book value of our consolidated fixed rate mortgages and unsecured indebtedness including commercial paper was billion and billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The fair values of these financial instruments and the related discount rate assumptions as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are summarized as follows: Weighted average discount rates assumed in calculation of fair value for fixed rate mortgages Weighted average discount rates assumed in calculation of fair value for unsecured indebtedness shares of common stock to a limited partner of the Operating Partnership in exchange for an equal number of units pursuant to the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Operating Partnership redeemed units from limited partners for million. These transactions increased Simon s ownership interest in the Operating Partnership. On February 8, 2024, Simon's Board of Directors authorized a new common stock repurchase plan which immediately replaced the existing repurchase plan. Under the plan, Simon may repurchase up to billion of its common stock during the period commencing on February 8, 2024 and ending on February 8, 2026 in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions as market conditions warrant. As of September 30, 2024, repurchases had been made under the new repurchase plan. As Simon repurchases shares under these programs, the Operating Partnership repurchases an equal number of units from Simon. We paid a common stock dividend of per share for the third quarter of 2024 , and per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . We paid common stock dividends of per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The Operating Partnership paid distributions per unit for the same amounts. On , Simon s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend for the fourth quarter of 2024 of per share, payable on to shareholders of record on .

 series of preferred units in the Operating Partnership and noncontrolling redeemable interests in properties in temporary equity. Each of these securities is discussed further below. Limited Partners Preferred Interest in the Operating Partnership and Noncontrolling Redeemable Interests in Properties . The redemption features of the preferred units in the Operating Partnership contain provisions which could require the Operating Partnership to settle the redemption in cash. As a result, this series of preferred units in the Operating Partnership remains classified outside permanent equity. The remaining interests in a property or portfolio of properties which are redeemable at the option of the holder or in circumstances that may be outside Simon s control are accounted for as temporary equity. The carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest is adjusted to the redemption amount assuming the instrument is redeemable at the balance sheet date. Changes in the redemption value of the underlying noncontrolling interest are recorded within accumulated deficit in the consolidated statements of equity in issuance of unit equivalents and other. There were noncontrolling interests redeemable at amounts in excess of fair value as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The following table summarizes the preferred units in the Operating Partnership and the amount of the noncontrolling redeemable interests in properties as follows: Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units, units authorized, and issued and outstanding, respectively Other noncontrolling redeemable interests Limited partners preferred interest in the Operating Partnership and noncontrolling redeemable interests in properties The Operating Partnership The Operating Partnership classifies as temporary equity those securities for which there is the possibility that the Operating Partnership could be required to redeem the security for cash, irrespective of the probability of such a possibility. As a result, the Operating Partnership classifies series of preferred units and noncontrolling redeemable interests in properties in temporary equity. The following table summarizes the preferred units and the amount of the noncontrolling redeemable interests in properties as follows: Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units, units authorized, and issued and outstanding, respectively Other noncontrolling redeemable interests Total preferred units, at liquidation value, and noncontrolling redeemable interests in properties Stock-Based Compensation Our long-term incentive compensation awards under our stock-based compensation plans primarily take the form of LTIP units, restricted stock units, and restricted stock. The substantial majority of these awards are market condition or performance-based, and are based on various market, corporate and business unit performance measures as further described below. The expense related to these programs, net of amounts capitalized, is included within home and regional office costs and general and administrative costs in the accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive income. LTIP units are a form of limited

 of the regular quarterly distributions paid on a unit of the Operating Partnership. As a result, we account for these LTIP units as participating securities under the two class method of computing earnings per share. These are granted under The Simon Property Group, L.P. 2019 Stock Incentive Plan, or the 2019 Plan. The grant date fair values of any LTIP units that are market-based awards are estimated using a Monte Carlo model, and the resulting fixed expense is recorded regardless of whether the market condition criteria are achieved if the participant performs the required service period. The grant date fair values of the market-based awards are being amortized into expense over the performance period, which is the grant date through the date at which the awards, if earned, become vested. The expense of the performance-based award is recorded over the performance period, which is the grant date through the date at which the awards, if earned, become vested, based on our assessment as to whether it is probable that the performance criteria will be achieved during the applicable performance periods. The grant date fair values of any restricted stock unit awards are recognized as expense over the vesting period. 2020 LTI Program.

Any units determined to be earned LTIP units under the 2021 LTI Program will vest on January 1, 2025. The 2021 LTI Program provides that the amount earned related to the performance-based portion of the awards is dependent on the Compensation and Human Capital Committee s determination that Simon s FFO performance and achievement of certain Objective Criteria Goals have been achieved and in March 2024, the Compensation and Human Capital Committee determined performance based LTIP units under this program were earned.

Variable lease income Total lease income Tenant receivables and accrued revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets includes straight-line receivables of million and million on September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. In connection with rent deferrals or other accruals of unpaid rent payments, if we determine that rent payments are probable of collection, we will continue to recognize lease income on a straight-line basis over the lease term along with associated tenant receivables. However, if we determine that such deferred rent payments or other accrued but unpaid rent payments are not probable of collection, lease income will be recorded on the cash basis, with the corresponding tenant receivable and deferred rent receivable balances charged as a direct write-off against lease income in the period of the change in our collectability determination. Additionally, our assessment of collectability incorporates information regarding a tenant s financial condition that is obtained from available financial data, the expected outcome of contractual disputes and other matters, and our communications and negotiations with the tenant. When a tenant seeks to reorganize its operations through bankruptcy proceedings, we assess the collectability of receivable balances. Our ongoing assessment incorporates, among other things, the timing of a tenant s bankruptcy filing and our expectations of the assumptions by the tenant in bankruptcy proceedings of leases at the Company s properties on substantially similar terms. of our consolidated properties with termination dates extending through 2090, including periods for which exercising an extension option is reasonably assured. These ground leases generally require us to make fixed annual rental payments, or a fixed annual rental payment plus a percentage rent component based upon the revenues or total sales of the property.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this report. Overview Simon Property Group, Inc. is a Delaware corporation that operates as a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code. REITs will generally not be liable for U.S. federal corporate income taxes as long as they distribute not less than 100 of their REIT taxable income. Simon Property Group, L.P. is our majority-owned Delaware partnership subsidiary that owns all of our real estate properties and other assets. According to the Operating Partnership s partnership agreement, the Operating Partnership is required to pay all expenses of Simon. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to Simon mean Simon Property Group, Inc. and references to the Operating Partnership mean Simon Property Group, L.P. References to we, us and our mean collectively Simon, the Operating Partnership and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by Simon and/or the Operating Partnership. We own, develop and manage premier shopping, dining, entertainment and mixed-use destinations, which consist primarily of malls, Premium Outlets , and The Mills . As of September 30, 2024, we owned or held an interest in 196 income-producing properties in the United States, which consisted of 93 malls, 70 Premium Outlets, 14 Mills, six lifestyle centers, and 13 other retail properties in 37 states and Puerto Rico. We also own an 84 noncontrolling interest in the Taubman Realty Group, LLC, or TRG, which has an interest in 22 regional, super-regional, and outlet malls in the U.S. and Asia. In addition, we have redevelopment and expansion projects, including the addition of anchors, big box tenants, and restaurants, underway at properties in North America, Europe and Asia. Internationally, as of September 30, 2024, we had ownership in 35 Premium Outlets and Designer Outlet properties primarily located in Asia, Europe, and Canada. As of September 30, 2024, we also owned a 22.4 equity stake in Kl pierre SA, or Kl pierre, a publicly traded, Paris-based real estate company which owns, or has an interest in, shopping centers located in 14 countries in Europe. We also have interests in investments in retail operations (J.C. Penney, SPARC Group, and Phoenix Retail LLC), an e-commerce venture (Rue Gilt Groupe, or RGG), and Jamestown (a global real estate investment and management company), collectively, our other platform investments. We generate the majority of our lease income from retail tenants including consideration received from: fixed minimum lease consideration and fixed common area maintenance (CAM) reimbursements, and variable lease consideration primarily based on tenants sales, as well as reimbursements for real estate taxes, utilities, marketing and certain other items. 
 Revenues of our management company, after intercompany eliminations, consist primarily of management fees that are typically based upon the revenues of the property being managed. We invest in real estate properties to maximize total financial return which includes both operating cash flows and capital appreciation. We seek growth in earnings, funds from operations, or FFO, and cash flows by enhancing the profitability and operation of our properties and investments. We seek to accomplish this growth through the following: attracting and retaining high quality tenants and utilizing economies of scale to reduce operating expenses, expanding and re-tenanting existing highly productive locations at competitive rental rates, selectively acquiring or increasing our interests in high quality real estate assets or portfolios of assets, generating consumer traffic in our retail properties through marketing initiatives and strategic corporate alliances, including creating mixed-use destinations, and selling selective non-core assets. 
 We also grow by generating supplemental revenues from the following activities: establishing our properties as leading market resource providers for retailers and other businesses and consumer-focused corporate alliances, including payment systems (such as handling fees relating to the sales of bank-issued prepaid cards), national marketing alliances, static and digital media initiatives, business development, sponsorship, and events, offering property operating services to our tenants and others, including waste handling and facility services, and the provision of energy services, selling or leasing land adjacent to our properties, commonly referred to as outlots or outparcels, and

 generating interest income on cash deposits and investments in loans, including those made to related entities. 
 We focus on high quality real estate across the retail real estate spectrum. We expand or redevelop properties to enhance profitability and market share of existing assets when we believe the investment of our capital meets our risk-reward criteria. We selectively develop new properties in markets we believe are not adequately served by existing retail outlet properties. We routinely review and evaluate acquisition opportunities based on their ability to enhance our portfolio. Our international strategy includes partnering with established real estate companies and financing international investments with local currency to minimize foreign exchange risk. To support our growth, we employ a three-fold capital strategy: provide the capital necessary to fund growth, maintain sufficient flexibility to access capital in many forms, both public and private, including but not limited to, having in place, the Operating Partnership s 5.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, or the Credit Facility, its 3.5 billion supplemental unsecured revolving credit facility, or the Supplemental Facility, and together, the Credit Facilities and its global unsecured commercial paper note program, or the Commercial Paper program, of 2.0 billion, or the non-U.S. dollar equivalent thereof, and manage our overall financial structure in a fashion that preserves our investment grade credit ratings. 
 We consider FFO, Real Estate FFO, net operating income, or NOI, and portfolio NOI to be key measures of operating performance that are not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. We use these measures internally to evaluate the operating performance of our portfolio and provide a basis for comparison with other real estate companies. Reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure are included below in this discussion. Results Overview Diluted earnings per share and diluted earnings per unit increased 0.54 during the first nine months of 2024 to 5.22 from 4.68 for the same period last year. The increase in diluted earnings per share and diluted earnings per unit was primarily attributable to: improved operating performance and solid core business fundamentals in 2024, as discussed below, a pre-tax gain during the first quarter of 2024 on the sale of all our remaining interests in Authentic Brands Group, or ABG, of 414.8 million, or 1.11 per diluted share/unit, partially offset by a non-cash pre-tax gain in 2023 on disposal exchange, or revaluation of equity interests of 194.6 million, or 0.52 per diluted share/unit, increased lease income of 156.4 million, or 0.42 per diluted share/unit, and increased other income of 90.2 million, or 0.24 per diluted share/unit, the majority of which is due to increased interest income of 83.8 million, or 0.22 per diluted share/unit, and an increase in land sales of 9.7 million, or 0.03 per diluted share/unit, partially offset by distributions and other activity of 3.3 million, or 0.01 per diluted share/unit, partially offset by, decreased income from unconsolidated entities of 141.5 million, or 0.38 per diluted share/unit, the majority of which is due to unfavorable year-over-year operations from other platform investments, partially offset by improved operations and core fundamentals in our other unconsolidated entities, unrealized unfavorable changes in fair value of publicly traded equity instruments and derivative instrument of 74.2 million, or 0.20 per diluted share/unit, increased interest expense of 48.7 million, or 0.13 per diluted share/unit, primarily due to new USD and Euro bond issuances subsequent to the third quarter of 2023 as well as increases to rates on variable rate mortgages, and increased income and other tax expense of 14.9 million, or 0.04 per diluted share/unit, primarily due to a 103.7 million, or 0.28 per diluted share/unit, tax impact as a result of the gain on disposal, exchange, or revaluation of equity interests transaction noted above during the first quarter of 2024, partially offset by the tax impact in 2023 from the SPARC and ABG dilution gains of 49.1 million and a tax benefit related to unfavorable year-over-year operations from other platform investments.

 Portfolio NOI increased 4.6 for the nine month period in 2024 over the prior year period primarily as a result of improved operations in our domestic and international portfolios compared to the prior year. Average base minimum rent for U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets increased 2.3 to 57.71 psf as of September 30, 2024, from 56.41 psf as of September 30, 2023. Ending occupancy for our U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets increased 1.0 to 96.2 as of September 30, 2024, from 95.2 as of September 30, 2023. Our effective overall borrowing rate at September 30, 2024 on our consolidated indebtedness increased 21 basis points to 3.61 as compared to 3.40 at September 30, 2023. This is primarily due to an increase in the effective overall borrowing rate on the fixed rate debt of 25 basis points, due to increasing benchmark rates. The weighted average years to maturity of our consolidated indebtedness was 8.0 years and 8.1 years at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Our financing activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included: the Operating Partnership completing, on September 26, 2024, the issuance of 1.0 billion senior unsecured notes with a fixed interest rate of 4.75 and a maturity date of September 26, 2034, amending, restating, and extending our 3.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility on September 19, 2024, completing, on September 13, 2024, the redemption at par of the Operating Partnership s 1.0 billion 2.00 senior unsecured notes at maturity, and completing, on February 1, 2024, the redemption at par of the Operating Partnership s 600 million 3.75 senior unsecured notes at maturity. 
 Subsequent to September 30, 2024, we completed the redemption at par of the Operating Partnerships 900 million 3.38 senior unsecured notes at maturity on October 1, 2024. United States Portfolio Data The portfolio data discussed in this overview includes the following key operating statistics: ending occupancy and average base minimum rent per square foot. We include acquired properties in this data beginning in the year of acquisition and remove disposed properties in the year of disposition. For comparative purposes, we separate the information related to The Mills from our other U.S. operations. We also do not include any information for properties located outside the United States. The following table sets forth these key operating statistics for the combined U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets: properties that are consolidated in our consolidated financial statements, properties we account for under the equity method of accounting as joint ventures, and the foregoing two categories of properties on a total portfolio basis.

 Ending Occupancy Levels and Average Base Minimum Rent per Square Foot. Ending occupancy is the percentage of gross leasable area, or GLA, which is leased as of the last day of the reporting period. We include all company owned space except for mall anchors, mall majors, mall freestanding and mall outlots in the calculation. Base minimum rent per square foot is the average base minimum rent charge in effect for the reporting period for all tenants that would qualify to be included in ending occupancy. Current Leasing Activities During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we signed 877 new leases and 1,750 renewal leases (excluding mall anchors and majors, new development, redevelopment and leases with terms of one year or less) with a fixed minimum rent across our U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets portfolio, comprising approximately 9.3 million square feet, of which 7.2 million square feet related to consolidated properties. During the comparable period in 2023, we signed 922 new leases and 1,440 renewal leases with a fixed minimum rent, comprising approximately 8.5 million square feet, of which 6.5 million square feet related to consolidated properties. The average annual initial base minimum rent for new leases was 65.45 per square foot in 2024 and 68.22 per square foot in 2023 with an average tenant allowance on new leases of 55.73 per square foot and 67.77 per square foot, respectively.

 On February 6, 2024, we acquired an additional interest in Miami International Mall from a joint venture partner, resulting in the consolidation of this property. On April 27, 2023, we opened Paris-Giverny Designer Outlet, a 228,000 square foot center in Vernon, France. We own a 74 interest in this center. 
 The following acquisitions, dispositions and openings of equity method investments and properties affected our income from unconsolidated entities in the comparative periods: During the first quarter of 2024, we disposed all of our remaining interest in ABG. During 2023, ABG completed multiple capital transactions which resulted in the dilution of our ownership and multiple deemed disposals of proportional interest of our investment. In addition, we sold a portion of our interest in ABG on November 29, 2023. These transactions reduced our ownership from 12.3 to 9.6 as of December 31, 2023. During the third quarter of 2023, we disposed of our interest in one unconsolidated retail property through foreclosure in satisfaction of its 114.8 million non-recourse loan. We recognized no gain or loss in connection with this disposal. On September 7, 2023, we acquired an additional 4 ownership in TRG for approximately 199.6 million by issuing 1,725,000 units in the Operating Partnership, bringing our noncontrolling ownership interest in TRG to 84 . During the third quarter of 2023, SPARC Group issued equity to a third party resulting in the dilution of our ownership to 33.3 and a deemed disposal of a proportional interest of our investment. As a result, we recognized a non-cash pre-tax gain on the deemed disposal of 145.8 million. 
 For the purposes of the following comparison between the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the above transactions are referred to as the property transactions. In the following discussions of our results of operations, comparable refers to properties we owned or held interests in and operated in both of the periods under comparison. Three months ended September 30, 2024 vs. Three months ended September 30, 2023 Lease income increased 41.1 million, due to an increase in fixed lease income of 51.1 million primarily due to an increase in fixed minimum lease consideration and higher occupancy, partially offset by a decrease in variable lease income based on tenant sales of 10.0 million. Total other income increased 25.3 million, primarily due to a 28.6 million increase in interest income, a 4.6 million increase in land sale activity and a 0.6 million increase in other income sources, partially offset by an 8.5 million decrease in mixed use and franchise operations income. Property operating expense increased 4.6 million as a result of inflationary cost increases. Real estate taxes decreased 21.5 million primarily due to successful property tax appeals, the majority of which relates to prior years. Advertising and promotion expense increased 5.3 million primarily due to increased programming expenses. Home and regional office costs increased 5.7 million due to increased personnel and compensation costs. Interest expense increased 14.2 million, primarily related to an increase of 16.8 million due to new USD unsecured bond issuances, an increase of 8.0 million due to the Euro exchangeable bond issuance in 2023, and the effect of the balance increase of the Credit Facility during 2023 of 4.0 million, partially offset by a decrease of 8.0 million due to the Supplemental Facility repayment during 2023 and a decrease of 6.6 million due to USD unsecured bond payoffs during 2024 and 2023. Gain on disposal, exchange or revaluation of equity interests, net, decreased 158.2 million due to the non-cash pre-tax gains on the deemed disposals of a portion of our investment in SPARC Group of 145.8 million and ABG of 12.4 million during 2023. Income and other tax expense decreased 40.6 million primarily due to the tax impact in 2023 from the SPARC and ABG dilutions gains. Income from unconsolidated entities decreased 37.0 million primarily due to lower results of operations from our other platform investments, partially offset by strong results and improved performance by our U.S. joint venture properties. We recorded net non-cash unrealized losses of 49.3 million in 2024 compared to net non-cash unrealized losses of 6.2 million in 2023, as a result of mark-to-market activity on publicly traded equity instruments and the change in fair value of a derivative instrument.

Income and other tax expense increased 14.9 million primarily due to increased tax expense of 103.7 million from the gain on sale of our remaining interest in ABG during 2024, partially offset by the tax impact in 2023 from the SPARC and ABG dilutions gains of 49.1 million and a tax benefit related to unfavorable year-over-year operations from other platform investments. Income from unconsolidated entities decreased 141.5 million primarily due to lower results of operations from our other platform investments, partially offset by strong results and improved performance by our U.S. joint venture properties. During the first nine months of 2024, we recorded a net gain of 6.8 million, which primarily related to a gain from the disposition of a property held in our TRG portfolio, our share of which was 10.6 million, partially offset by a 6.0 million loss on the disposition of certain assets by Kl pierre. During the first nine months of 2023, we recorded a net loss of 9.9 million, which primarily related to the disposition of certain assets by Kl pierre. We recorded net non-cash unrealized losses of 54.1 million in 2024 compared to net non-cash unrealized losses of 20.0 million in 2023, as a result of mark-to-market activity on publicly traded equity instruments and the change in fair value of a derivative instrument. Simon s net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased 31.7 million due to an increase in the net income of the Operating Partnership. Liquidity and Capital Resources Because we own long-lived income-producing assets, our financing strategy relies primarily on long-term fixed rate debt. Floating rate debt comprised 0.9 of our total consolidated debt at September 30, 2024. We also enter into interest rate protection agreements from time to time to manage our interest rate risk. We derive most of our liquidity from positive net cash flow from operations and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities that totaled 3.0 billion in the aggregate during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Credit Facilities and the Commercial Paper program provide alternative sources of liquidity as our cash needs vary from time to time. Borrowing capacity under these sources may be increased as discussed further below. Our balance of cash and cash equivalents increased 1.0 billion during the first nine months of 2024 to 2.2 billion as of September 30, 2024 as a result of the operating and financing activity, as further discussed in Cash Flows below. Additionally, our short-term investments balances decreased 700.0 million to 300.0 million during the first nine months of 2024. On September 30, 2024, we had an aggregate available borrowing capacity of approximately 8.1 billion under the Credit Facilities, net of outstanding borrowings of 325.1 million and letters of credit of 58.6 million. For the nine months ended

 September 30, 2024, the maximum aggregate outstanding balance under the Credit Facilities was 325.1 million and the weighted average outstanding balance was 306.3 million. The weighted average interest rate was 5.31 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Simon has historically had access to public equity markets and the Operating Partnership has historically had access to private and public long and short-term unsecured debt markets and access to secured debt and private equity from institutional investors at the property level. Our business model and Simon s status as a REIT require us to regularly access the debt markets to raise funds for acquisition, development and redevelopment activity, and to refinance maturing debt. Simon may also, from time to time, access the equity capital markets to accomplish our business objectives. We believe we have sufficient cash on hand and availability under the Credit Facilities and the Commercial Paper program to address our debt maturities and capital needs through 2024. Cash Flows Our net cash flow from operating activities and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 3.0 billion. In addition, we had net repayments of debt from our debt financing and repayment activities of 806.4 million in the first nine months of 2024. These activities are further discussed below under Financing and Debt. During the first nine months of 2024, we also: paid stockholder dividends and unitholder distributions totaling approximately 2.3 billion and preferred unit distributions totaling 3.8 million, funded consolidated capital expenditures of 537.7 million (including development and other costs of 64.3 million, redevelopment and expansion costs of 237.4 million, and tenant costs and other operational capital expenditures of 236.0 million), funded the redemption of 40.9 million Operating Partnership units, funded investments in unconsolidated entities of 35.0 million, received net proceeds from the redemption of short-term investments of 700.0 million, and received proceeds from the sale of equity instruments of 1.2 billion. 
 In general, we anticipate that cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet operating expenses, monthly debt service, recurring capital expenditures, and dividends to stockholders and/or distributions to partners necessary to maintain Simon s REIT qualification on a long-term basis. In addition, we expect to be able to generate or obtain capital for nonrecurring capital expenditures, such as acquisitions, major building redevelopments and expansions, as well as for scheduled principal maturities on outstanding indebtedness, from the following, however a severe and prolonged disruption and instability in the global financial markets, including the debt and equity capital markets, may affect our ability to access necessary capital: excess cash generated from operating performance and working capital reserves, borrowings on the Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper program, additional secured or unsecured debt financing, or additional equity raised in the public or private markets. 
 We expect to generate positive cash flow from operations in 2024, and we consider these projected cash flows in our sources and uses of cash. These cash flows are principally derived from rents paid by our tenants. A significant deterioration in projected cash flows from operations could cause us to increase our reliance on available funds from the Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper program, further curtail planned capital expenditures, or seek other additional sources of financing. Financing and Debt Unsecured Debt At September 30, 2024, our unsecured debt consisted of 20.1 billion of senior unsecured notes of the Operating Partnership and 325.1 million outstanding under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility has an initial borrowing capacity of 5.0 billion which may be increased in the form of additional commitments in the aggregate not to exceed 1.0 billion, for a total aggregate size of 6.0 billion, subject to obtaining additional lender commitments and satisfying certain customary conditions precedent.

At September 30, 2024, we had an aggregate available borrowing capacity of 8.1 billion under the Credit Facilities. The maximum aggregate outstanding balance under the Credit Facilities, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 325.1 million and the weighted average outstanding balance was 306.3 million. Letters of credit of 58.6 million were outstanding under the Credit Facilities as of September 30, 2024. The Operating Partnership also has available a Commercial Paper program. The Operating Partnership may issue unsecured commercial paper notes, denominated in U.S. dollars, Euro and other currencies. Notes issued in non-U.S. currencies may be issued by one or more subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership and are guaranteed by the Operating Partnership. Notes are sold under customary terms in the U.S. and Euro commercial paper note markets and rank (either by themselves or as a result of the guarantee described above) pari passu with the Operating Partnership s other unsecured senior indebtedness. The Commercial Paper program is supported by the Credit Facilities and, if necessary or appropriate, we may make one or more draws under either of the Credit Facilities to pay amounts outstanding from time to time on the Commercial Paper program. On September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding balance under the Commercial Paper program. Borrowings reduce amounts otherwise available under the Credit Facilities. On September 26, 2024, the Operating Partnership completed the issuance of 1.0 billion of senior unsecured notes with a fixed interest rate of 4.75 with a maturity date of September 26, 2034.

 dollar equivalent) outstanding under the Supplemental Facility on November 17, 2023. The exchangeable option within the bonds has been determined to meet the criteria for bifurcation as previously discussed in Note 3. On November 9, 2023, the Operating Partnership completed the issuance of the following senior unsecured notes: 500 million with a fixed interest rate of 6.25 and 500 million with a fixed interest rate of 6.65 , with maturity dates of January 15, 2034 and January 15, 2054, respectively.

On June 1, 2023, the Operating Partnership completed the redemption, at par, of its 600 million 2.75 senior unsecured notes at maturity. On April 28, 2023 the Operating Partnership completed a borrowing of 180.0 million under the Credit Facility and subsequently unencumbered two properties. On March 8, 2023, the Operating Partnership completed the issuance of the following senior unsecured notes: 650 million with a fixed interest rate 5.50 , and 650 million with a fixed interest rate of 5.85 , with maturity dates of March 8, 2033 and March 8, 2053, respectively.

On January 10, 2023, the Operating Partnership completed interest rate swap agreements with a combined notional value at 750.0 million to swap the interest rate of the Euro denominated borrowings outstanding under the Supplemental Facility to an all-in fixed rate of 3.81 . These interest rate swaps were terminated in connection with the repayment of these borrowings on November 14, 2023. Mortgage Debt Total mortgage indebtedness was 5.1 billion and 5.2 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Covenants Our unsecured debt agreements contain financial covenants and other non-financial covenants. The Credit Facilities contain ongoing covenants relating to total and secured leverage to capitalization value, minimum earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or EBITDA, and unencumbered EBITDA coverage requirements. Payment under the Credit Facilities can be accelerated if the Operating Partnership or Simon is subject to bankruptcy proceedings or upon the occurrence of certain other events. If we were to fail to comply with these covenants, after the expiration of the applicable cure periods, the debt maturity could be accelerated or other remedies could be sought by the lender, including adjustments to the applicable interest rate. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants of our unsecured debt. At September 30, 2024, our consolidated subsidiaries were the borrowers under 35 non-recourse mortgage notes secured by mortgages on 38 properties and other assets, including two separate pools of cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized mortgages encumbering a total of five properties. Under these cross-default provisions, a default under any mortgage included in the cross-defaulted pool may constitute a default under all mortgages within that pool and may lead to acceleration of the indebtedness due on each property within the pool. Certain of our secured debt instruments contain financial and other non-financial covenants which are specific to the properties that serve as collateral for that debt. If the applicable borrower under these non-recourse mortgage notes were to fail to comply with these covenants, the lender could accelerate the debt and enforce its rights against their collateral. At September 30, 2024, the applicable borrowers under these non-recourse mortgage notes were in compliance with all covenants where non-compliance could individually or in the aggregate, giving effect to applicable cross-default provisions, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.

 Contractual Obligations There have been no material changes to our outstanding capital expenditure and lease commitments previously disclosed in the combined 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K of Simon and the Operating Partnership. In regards to long-term debt arrangements, the following table summarizes the material aspects of these future obligations on our consolidated indebtedness as of September 30, 2024, for the remainder of 2024 and subsequent years thereafter (dollars in thousands), assuming the obligations remain outstanding through initial maturities, including applicable exercise of available extension options:

 (1) Represents principal maturities only and, therefore, excludes net discounts and debt issuance costs. (2) Variable rate interest payments are estimated based on the SOFR or other applicable rate at September 30, 2024. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off-balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of our investments in joint ventures which are common in the real estate industry and are described in Note 6 of the condensed notes to our consolidated financial statements. Our joint ventures typically fund their cash needs through secured debt financings obtained by and in the name of the joint venture entity. The joint venture debt is secured by a first mortgage, is without recourse to the joint venture partners, and does not represent a liability of the partners, except to the extent the partners or their affiliates expressly guarantee the joint venture debt. In addition to the guarantee disclosed in Note 6, as of September 30, 2024, the Operating Partnership guaranteed joint venture-related mortgage indebtedness of 126.6 million. Mortgages guaranteed by the Operating Partnership are secured by the property of the joint venture which could be sold in order to satisfy the outstanding obligation and which has an estimated fair value in excess of the guaranteed amount. We may elect to fund cash needs of a joint venture through equity contributions (generally on a basis proportionate to our ownership interests), advances or partner loans, although such fundings are not typically required contractually or otherwise. Acquisitions and Dispositions Buy-sell, marketing rights, and other exit mechanisms are common in real estate partnership agreements. Most of our partners are institutional investors who have a history of direct investment in retail real estate. We and our partners in our joint venture properties may initiate these provisions (subject to any applicable lock up or similar restrictions). If we determine it is in our stockholders best interests for us to purchase the joint venture interest and we believe we have adequate liquidity to execute the purchase without hindering our cash flows, then we may initiate these provisions or elect to buy our partner s interest. If we decide to sell any of our joint venture interests, we expect to use the net proceeds to reduce outstanding indebtedness or to reinvest in development, redevelopment, or expansion opportunities. Acquisitions. On February 6, 2024, we acquired an additional interest in Miami International Mall from a joint venture partner, resulting in the consolidation of this property. The cash consideration for this transactions was de minimis. The property is subject to a 158.0 million 6.92 fixed rate mortgage loan.

 Dispositions. We may continue to pursue the disposition of properties that no longer meet our strategic criteria or that are not a primary retail venue within their trade area. During 2023, we disposed of our interest in one unconsolidated retail property through foreclosure in satisfaction of the 114.8 million non-recourse mortgage loan. We recognized no gain or loss in connection with this disposal. Joint Venture Formation and Other Investment Activity During the second quarter of 2024, we participated in the formation of a joint venture, Phoenix Retail, LLC, to acquire the Express Retail Company and operate Express and Bonobos direct-to-consumer businesses in the United States, from the previous owner on June 21, 2024, in a bankruptcy proceeding. There was no cash consideration transferred for our 39.4 noncontrolling interest and non-cash consideration was de minimis. During the first quarter of 2024, we sold all of our remaining interest in ABG for cash proceeds of 1.2 billion, resulting in a pre-tax gain of 414.8 million, which is included in gain on disposal, exchange, or revaluation of equity interests, net, in the consolidated statement of operations. In connection with this transaction, we recorded tax expense of 103.7 million, which is included in income and other tax (expense) benefit in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we sold a portion of our interest in ABG, resulting in a pre-tax gain of 157.1 million. In connection with this transaction, we recorded tax expense of 39.3 million. Concurrently, ABG completed a capital transaction resulting in the dilution of our ownership to approximately 9.6 and a deemed disposal of a proportional interest of our investment. As a result, we recognized a non-cash pre-tax gain on the deemed disposal of 10.3 million. In connection with this transaction, we recorded deferred taxes of 2.6 million. On September 7, 2023, we acquired an additional 4 ownership in TRG for approximately 199.6 million by issuing 1,725,000 units in the Operating Partnership, bringing our noncontrolling ownership interest in TRG to 84 . During the third quarter of 2023, SPARC Group issued equity to a third party resulting in the dilution of our ownership to 33.3 and a deemed disposal of a proportional interest of our investment. As a result, we recognized a non-cash pre-tax gain on the deemed disposal of 145.8 million. In connection with this transaction, we recorded deferred taxes of 36.9 million. During the third quarter of 2023, ABG completed a capital transaction resulting in the dilution of our ownership to approximately 11.7 and a deemed disposal of a proportional interest of our investment. As a result, we recognized a non-cash pre-tax gain on the deemed disposal of 12.4 million. In connection with this transaction, we recorded deferred taxes of 3.1 million. During the second quarter of 2023, ABG completed a capital transaction resulting in a dilution of our ownership and a deemed disposal of a proportional interest of our investment. As a result, we recognized a non-cash pre-tax gain on the deemed disposal of 36.4 million. In connection with this transaction, we recorded deferred taxes of 9.1 million. Development Activity We routinely incur costs related to construction for significant redevelopment and expansion projects at our properties. Redevelopment and expansion projects, including the addition of anchors, big box tenants, restaurants, as well as office space and residential uses are underway at properties in North America, Europe and Asia. Construction continues on certain redevelopment and new development projects in the U.S. and internationally that are nearing completion. Our share of the costs of all new development, redevelopment and expansion projects currently under construction is approximately 1.3 billion. Simon s share of remaining net cash funding required to complete the new development and redevelopment projects currently under construction in the remainder of 2024 and 2025 is approximately 503 million. We expect to fund these capital projects with cash flows from operations. We seek a stabilized return on invested capital in the range of 8-10 for all of our new development, expansion and redevelopment projects. International Development Activity. We typically reinvest net cash flow from our international joint ventures to fund future international development activity. We believe this strategy mitigates some of the risk of our initial investment and our exposure to changes in foreign currencies. We have also funded most of our foreign investments with local currency-denominated borrowings that act as a natural hedge against fluctuations in exchange rates. Our consolidated net income exposure to changes in the volatility of the Euro, Yen, Peso, Won, and other foreign currencies is not material. We expect our share of estimated committed capital for international development projects to be completed with projected delivery in 2024 or 2025 is 80 million, primarily funded through reinvested joint venture cash flow and construction loans.

 Dividends, Distributions and Stock Repurchase Program Simon paid a common stock dividend of 2.05 per share for the third quarter of 2024 and 6.00 per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Simon paid common stock dividends of 5.55 per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Operating Partnership paid distributions per unit for the same amounts. On November 1, 2024, Simon s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend for the fourth quarter of 2024 of 2.10 per share, payable on December 30, 2024 to shareholders of record on December 9, 2024. The distribution rate on units is equal to the dividend rate on common stock. In order to maintain its status as a REIT, Simon must pay a minimum amount of dividends. Simon s future dividends and the Operating Partnership s future distributions will be determined by Simon s Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, based on actual and projected financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, cash available for dividends and limited partner distributions, cash reserves as deemed necessary for capital and operating expenditures, financing covenants, if any, and the amount required to maintain Simon s status as a REIT. On February 8, 2024, Simon's Board of Directors authorized a new common stock repurchase plan which immediately replaced the existing repurchase plan. Under the plan, Simon may repurchase up to 2.0 billion of its common stock during the two-year period commencing on February 8, 2024 and ending on February 8, 2026 in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions as market conditions warrant. As of September 30, 2024, no repurchases had been made under the new repurchase plan. As Simon repurchases shares under these programs, the Operating Partnership repurchases an equal number of units from Simon. Forward-Looking Statements Certain statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may be deemed "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although the Company believes the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the Company can give no assurance that its expectations will be attained, and it is possible that the Company's actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Such factors include, but are not limited to: changes in economic and market conditions that may adversely affect the general retail environment, including but not limited to those caused by inflation, recessionary pressures, wars, escalating geopolitical tensions as a result of the war in Ukraine and the conflicts in the Middle East, and supply chain disruptions; the inability to renew leases and relet vacant space at existing properties on favorable terms; the inability to collect rent due to the bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants or otherwise; the potential loss of anchor stores or major tenants; the inability to collect rent due to the bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants or otherwise; an increase in vacant space at our properties; the potential for violence, civil unrest, criminal activity or terrorist activities at our properties; natural disasters; the availability of comprehensive insurance coverage; the intensely competitive market environment in the retail industry, including e-commerce; security breaches that could compromise our information technology or infrastructure; reducing emissions of greenhouse gases; environmental liabilities; our international activities subjecting us to risks that are different from or greater than those associated with our domestic operations, including changes in foreign exchange rates; our continued ability to maintain our status as a REIT; changes in tax laws or regulations that result in adverse tax consequences; risks associated with the acquisition, development, redevelopment, expansion, leasing and management of properties; the inability to lease newly developed properties on favorable terms; the loss of key management personnel; uncertainties regarding the impact of pandemics, epidemics or public health crises, and the associated governmental restrictions on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity; changes in market rates of interest; the impact of our substantial indebtedness on our future operations, including covenants in the governing agreements that impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to operate freely; any disruption in the financial markets that may adversely affect our ability to access capital for growth and satisfy our ongoing debt service requirements; any change in our credit rating; risks relating to our joint venture properties, including guarantees of certain joint venture indebtedness; and general risks related to real estate investments, including the illiquidity of real estate investments. The Company discusses these and other risks and uncertainties under the heading "Risk Factors" in its annual and quarterly periodic reports filed with the SEC. The Company may update that discussion in subsequent other periodic reports, but except as required

 by law, the Company undertakes no duty or obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Industry practice is to evaluate real estate properties in part based on performance measures such as FFO, real estate FFO, diluted FFO per share, real estate FFO per share, NOI, beneficial interest of combined NOI and portfolio NOI. We believe that these non-GAAP measures are helpful to investors because they are widely recognized measures of the performance of REITs and provide a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. We also use these measures internally to measure the operating performance of our portfolio. We are providing different components of NOI, such as Portfolio NOI (a component of beneficial interest of combined NOI that relates to the operational performance of our global real estate portfolio), to provide investors with disaggregated information to further differentiate our global real estate portfolio performance from corporate and other platform investments. We determine FFO based upon the definition set forth by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT Funds From Operations White Paper 2018 Restatement. Our main business includes acquiring, owning, operating, developing, and redeveloping real estate in conjunction with the rental of real estate. Gain and losses of assets incidental to our main business are included in FFO. We determine FFO to be our share of consolidated net income computed in accordance with GAAP: excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items, excluding gains and losses from the acquisition of controlling interest, sale, disposal or property insurance recoveries of, or any impairment related to, depreciable retail operating properties, plus the allocable portion of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures based upon economic ownership interest, and all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP. 
 We determine real estate FFO utilizing the definition of FFO as stated above excluding the impact of operations from Other Platform Investments, net of tax, gains or losses on disposal, exchange, or revaluation of equity interests, net of tax, and unrealized gains or losses in fair value of publicly traded equity instruments and derivative instruments. 
 You should understand that our computations of these non-GAAP measures might not be comparable to similar measures reported by other REITs and that these non-GAAP measures: do not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance, and are not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.

Controls and Procedures Simon Management s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Simon maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s, or the SEC s, rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Simon s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Because of inherent limitations, disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures are met. Our management, with the participation of Simon s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of Simon s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, Simon s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, Simon s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have not been any changes in Simon s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Simon s internal control over financial reporting. The Operating Partnership Management s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Operating Partnership maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including Simon s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

 Part II Other Information Item 1. Legal Proceedings We are involved from time-to-time in various legal and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business, including, but not limited to, commercial disputes, environmental matters, and litigation in connection with transactions such as acquisitions and divestitures.
