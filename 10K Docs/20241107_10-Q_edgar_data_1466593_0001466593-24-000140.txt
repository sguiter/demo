 Coal Combustion Residual Regulations 
 In May 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a final rule amending coal combustion residual (CCR) regulations which introduces new requirements for the management of coal ash at active coal-fired power plants and inactive coal-fired power plants with a legacy surface impoundment. The regulations impose new requirements including groundwater monitoring, closure standards, post-closure care obligations, and potential remediation activities. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have not recognized an ARO for any liabilities which may be incurred because of the EPA s final CCR rule as we cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of such a liability. We continue to review and assess the complex regulation to determine whether and to what extent, if any, our facilities will be impacted. Specifically, we are evaluating certain definitional matters within the regulation to determine the precise closure standards at an active facility. In addition, further site evaluations are necessary to determine the amount of coal ash stored on areas previously exempt from regulation, including areas of beneficial use.

 On March 28, 2024, OTP entered into a Note Purchase Agreement pursuant to which OTP issued, in a private placement transaction, million of senior unsecured notes consisting of (a) million of Series 2024A Senior Unsecured Notes due April 1, 2034, and (b) million of Series 2024B Senior Unsecured Notes due April 1, 2054. 
 Per the terms of the agreement, OTP may prepay all or any part of the notes (in an amount not less than of the aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding in the case of a partial prepayment) at of the principal amount so prepaid, together with unpaid accrued interest and a make-whole amount, as defined in the agreement; provided that no default or event of default exists under the agreement. Any prepayment of the Series 2024A Notes then outstanding on or after January 1, 2034, or the Series 2024B Notes then outstanding on or after October 1, 2053, will be made without any make-whole amount. Consistent with other of our borrowings, the agreement contains a number of restrictions on the business of OTP, including restrictions on OTP s ability to merge, sell substantially all assets, create or incur liens on assets, guarantee the obligations of any other party, and engage in certain transactions with affiliates. 
 Financial Covenants 
 Certain of OTC's and OTP's short- and long-term debt agreements require the borrower, whether OTC or OTP, to maintain certain financial covenants, including a maximum debt to total capitalization ratio of to 1.00, a minimum interest and dividend coverage ratio of to 1.00, and a maximum level of priority indebtedness. As of September 30, 2024, OTC and OTP were in compliance with these financial covenants.

 million as of September 30, 2024, and resulted in a pre-tax benefit of million recognized in our consolidated statements of income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Regional Haze Rule (RHR). The RHR was adopted in an effort to improve visibility in national parks and wilderness areas. The RHR requires states, in coordination with the EPA and other governmental agencies, to develop and implement plans to achieve natural visibility conditions. The second RHR implementation period covers the years 2018-2028. States are required to submit a state implementation plan to assess reasonable progress with the RHR and determine what additional emission reductions are appropriate, if any. 
 Coyote Station, OTP's jointly owned coal-fired power plant in North Dakota, is subject to assessment in the second implementation period under the North Dakota state implementation plan. The North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality (NDDEQ) submitted its state implementation plan to the EPA for approval in August 2022. In its plan, the NDDEQ concluded it is not reasonable to require additional emission controls during this planning period. 
 In June 2023, a coalition of environmental organizations filed a lawsuit against the EPA for failing to enforce the RHR. In response, the EPA proposed, through a consent decree filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in March 2024, a timeline for it to act on outstanding state implementation plans. Under the consent decree, which was issued on July 12, 2024, the EPA would approve, deny, partially approve or issue a federal implementation plan at assigned dates between 2024 and 2026, including a final decision on the North Dakota state implementation plan by November 2024. 
 In July 2024, the EPA published its proposed rule for North Dakota s state implementation plan, in which the EPA proposed to approve certain aspects of the state implementation plan and disapprove of other aspects of the plan. The EPA proposes to find that North Dakota failed to submit a long-term strategy that includes enforceable emissions limitations, compliance schedules, and other measures necessary to make reasonable progress on national visibility goals. Specific to Coyote Station, the EPA contends North Dakota relied on non-statutory visibility modeling to reject the installation of emission controls. The EPA also proposes to find the North Dakota plan does not adequately demonstrate that existing limits for nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) at Coyote Station are sufficient to ensure progress towards the national visibility goals. We continue to anticipate the EPA to issue their final rule in November 2024. If, in its final rule, the EPA finds the state implementation plan is incomplete or disapproves of it, in whole or in part, the EPA must promulgate a Federal Implementation Plan within two years from the issuance of its final decision. The Federal Implementation Plan may include emission controls required to satisfy the requirements of the RHR. 
 We cannot predict with certainty the final resolution of regional haze compliance in North Dakota and specifically the impact, if any, on the operations of Coyote Station. However, significant emission control investments could be required and the recovery of such costs from customers would require regulatory approval. Alternatively, investments in emission control equipment may prove to be uneconomic and result in the early retirement, or sale, of our interest in Coyote Station, which would be subject to regulatory approval. We cannot estimate the ultimate financial effects such a retirement or sale may have on our consolidated operating results, financial position or cash flows, but such amounts could be material and the recovery of such costs in rates would be subject to regulatory approval.

 common shares under an Automatic Dividend Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan, which provides shareholders, retail customers of OTP and other interested investors methods of purchasing our common shares by reinvesting their dividends or making optional cash investments. Shares purchased under the plan may be newly issued common shares or common shares purchased on the open market. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we issued shares under this plan. We repurchased a sufficient number of shares on the open market to satisfy all issuances under the plan; accordingly, no proceeds were received as a result of the issuance of these shares. As of September 30, 2024, there were shares available for purchase or issuance under the plan. The registration statement expires in May 2027. 
 Dividend Restrictions 
 OTC is a holding company with no significant operations of its own. The primary source of funds for payments of dividends to OTC's shareholders is from dividends paid or distributions made by OTC's subsidiaries. As a result of certain statutory limitations or regulatory or financing agreements, the amount of distributions allowed to be made by OTC's subsidiaries or the amount of dividends paid by OTC could be restricted. Both the OTC Credit Agreement and the OTP Credit Agreement contain restrictions on the payment of cash dividends upon a default or event of default, including failure to maintain certain financial covenants. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with these financial covenants. 
 Under the Federal Power Act, a public utility may not pay dividends from any funds properly included in a capital account. What constitutes funds properly included in a capital account is undefined in the Federal Power Act or the related regulations; however, the FERC has consistently interpreted the provision to allow dividends to be paid as long as i) the source of the dividends is clearly disclosed, ii) the dividend is not excessive and iii) there is no self-dealing on the part of corporate officials. 
 and based on OTP s current capital structure requirements. As of September 30, 2024, OTP s equity-to-total-capitalization ratio, including short-term debt, was and its net assets restricted from distribution totaled approximately million. Under the MPUC order, total capitalization for OTP cannot exceed billion.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our interim financial statements and the related notes appearing under Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and our annual financial statements and the related notes along with the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Otter Tail Corporation and its subsidiaries form a diverse group of businesses with operations classified into three segments: Electric, Manufacturing and Plastics. Our Electric segment business is a vertically integrated, regulated utility with generation, transmission and distribution facilities to serve our customers in western Minnesota, eastern North Dakota and northeastern South Dakota. Our Manufacturing segment provides metal fabrication for custom machine parts and metal components and manufactures extruded and thermoformed plastic products. Our Plastics segment manufactures PVC pipe for use in, among other applications, municipal and rural water, wastewater and water reclamation projects. 
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS QUARTER TO DATE 
 Provided below is a summary and discussion of our operating results on a consolidated basis followed by a discussion of the operating results of each of our segments: Electric, Manufacturing and Plastics. In addition to the segment results, we provide an overview of our Corporate costs. Our Corporate costs do not constitute a reportable segment, but rather consist of unallocated general corporate expenses, such as corporate staff and overhead costs, the results of our captive insurance company and other items excluded from the measurement of segment performance. Corporate costs are added to operating segment totals to reconcile to totals on our consolidated statements of income. 
 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS 
 The following table summarizes consolidated operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 (in thousands) 2024 2023 change change Operating Revenues 338,033 358,056 (20,023) (5.6) Operating Expenses 230,492 236,940 (6,448) (2.7) Operating Income 107,541 121,116 (13,575) (11.2) Interest Expense (11,173) (9,175) (1,998) 21.8 Nonservice Components of Postretirement Benefits 2,367 2,289 78 3.4 Other Income (Expense), net 5,421 2,471 2,950 119.4 Income Before Income Taxes 104,156 116,701 (12,545) (10.7) Income Tax Expense 18,677 24,727 (6,050) (24.5) Net Income 85,479 91,974 (6,495) (7.1) 
 Operating Revenues decreased 20.0 million primarily due to decreased sales volumes in our Manufacturing segment. See our segment disclosures below for additional discussion of items impacting operating revenues. 
 Operating Expenses decreased 6.4 million primarily due to decreased sales volumes in our Manufacturing segment and lower fuel costs in our Electric segment. See our segment disclosures below for additional discussion of items impacting operating expenses. 
 Interest Expense increased 2.0 million primarily due to the issuance of an additional 120.0 million of long-term debt at OTP in March 2024, the proceeds of which were used to repay short-term borrowings, fund capital expenditures, and support operating activities. 
 Other Income (Expense) increased 3.0 million, having a positive impact on net income, primarily due to increased investment income earned on our short- and long-term investments. Increased investment income was primarily driven by increased available cash for investment from cash generation of our Plastics segment. Gains on our corporate-owned life insurance policies also contributed to the increase in other income. 
 Income Tax Expense decreased 6.1 million primarily due to decreased income before income taxes and an increase in PTCs at OTP due to increased wind and solar generation. Our effective tax rate was 17.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 21.2 for the same period last year.

 Effect on Diluted Earnings Per Share 0.01 0.02 (0.01) 
 Retail Revenues increased 0.3 million primarily due to the following: 
 A 3.0 million increase in retail revenues, net of an estimated refund, from an interim rate increase in North Dakota effective January 1, 2024 in connection with our current rate case. 
 A 1.1 million increase due to the impact of favorable weather. 
 The increases in retail revenues described above were partially offset by the following: 
 A 2.9 million decrease in fuel recovery revenues due to lower generation from our coal-fired and natural gas facilities and lower market energy prices. 
 Retail revenues were also impacted by a net decrease in rider revenues primarily due to increased PTCs from our wind and solar generation, which are passed on to customers, partially offset by additional recovery of costs associated with our advanced meter infrastructure and wind repowering projects. 
 Transmission Services Revenues increased 1.5 million primarily due a reduction in our estimated refund liability in connection with the resolution of a contested matter with FERC related to the allowed ROE during certain prior periods, which resulted in an

 additional nonrecurring revenue in the current period. The impact of the reduced refund was partially offset by refunds paid to other transmission owners in the current period. 
 Wholesale Revenues decreased 1.6 million primarily due to a 40 decrease in wholesale sales volumes. 
 Production Fuel costs decreased 4.6 million primarily due to a decrease in generation from our coal-fired and natural gas facilities compared to the same period last year, as described above. 
 Depreciation and Amortization increased 1.8 million due to additional assets, including certain distribution assets, being placed in service. 
 
 MANUFACTURING SEGMENT RESULTS 
 The following table summarizes Manufacturing segment operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 (in thousands) 2024 2023 change change Operating Revenues 79,896 100,678 (20,782) (20.6) Cost of Products Sold (excluding depreciation) 64,398 76,288 (11,890) (15.6) Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses

 Operating Revenues decreased 20.8 million primarily due to a 13 decrease in sales volumes, with declines experienced primarily in the recreational vehicle, agriculture, construction, and lawn and garden end markets. Sales volumes have softened due to lower end market demand and inventory management efforts by manufacturers and dealers. A 37 decline in scrap metal revenues, largely driven by lower production volumes and a 6 decrease in steel costs, which are passed through to customers, also contributed to the decrease in operating revenues. 
 Cost of Products Sold decreased 11.9 million primarily due to lower sales volumes, as described above. 
 Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses decreased 3.4 million primarily due to variable costs associated with decreased business activity and financial performance during the period. 
 
 PLASTICS SEGMENT RESULTS

 Operating Revenues increased 0.7 million as a 13 increase in sales volumes, driven by continued customer sales volume growth and distributor and end market demand, was largely offset by continued declining sales prices. Sales prices have steadily declined throughout the year and decreased 11 compared to the same period last year. 
 Cost of Products Sold increased 5.0 million primarily due to increased sales volumes, as described above. The unique supply and demand conditions experienced in recent years, which caused significant volatility and increases in resin costs, have subsided and resin costs remained stable during the period. 
 Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses increased 2.0 million primarily due to costs associated with ongoing litigation regarding the pricing of PVC pipe, which is further described in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, as well as variable costs associated with financial performance during the period.

See our segment disclosures below for additional discussion of items impacting operating expenses. 
 Interest Expense increased 2.9 million due to the issuance of an additional 120.0 million of long-term debt at OTP in March 2024, the proceeds of which were used to repay short-term borrowings, fund capital expenditures, and support operating activities. 
 Other Income increased 6.7 million, having a positive impact on net income, primarily due to increased investment income earned on our short-term cash equivalent investments and long-term marketable securities. Increased investment income was primarily driven by increased available cash for investment resulting from cash generation in our Plastics segment. Allowance for funds used during construction in our Electric segment also increased related to an increase in capital expenditures compared to the same period last year. 
 Income Tax Expense decreased 1.0 million compared to the same period last year. Our effective tax rate was 18.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 19.7 for the same period last year. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily driven by an increase in PTCs from our wind and solar generation assets.

 REGULATORY MATTERS 
 The following provides a summary of general rate, rate rider, and other regulatory filings that have or are expected to have a material impact on our operating results, financial position or cash flows. 
 GENERAL RATES 
 North Dakota Rate Case 
 On November 2, 2023, OTP filed a request with the North Dakota Public Service Commission (NDPSC) for an increase in revenue recoverable under general rates in North Dakota. In its filing, OTP requested a net increase in annual revenue of 17.4 million, or 8.4 , based on an allowed rate of return on rate base of 7.85 and an allowed rate of return on equity of 10.6 on an equity ratio of 53.5 of total capital. Through this proceeding, OTP has proposed changes to the mechanism of cost and investment recovery, with recovery moving from riders into base rates. The filing also includes a proposal to implement a sales adjustment mechanism to address potential significant load additions or losses. 
 The filing included an interim rate request of a net increase in annual revenue of 12.4 million, or 6.0 , which was approved by the NDPSC on December 13, 2023. Interim rates went into effect on January 1, 2024, and are subject to potential refund until the finalization of the rate case. 
 On July 3, 2024, OTP filed an update to the original request increasing the amount of the net annual revenue requirement increase from 17.4 million to 22.5 million, or a net increase of 10.9 in annual revenue, to account for certain items identified throughout the regulatory process to date. An evidentiary hearing before the NDPSC is scheduled to take place in December 2024, with a final decision anticipated in early 2025.

 RESOURCE PLANNING 
 Minnesota 
 In May 2024, the MPUC approved OTP s 2023 to 2037 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP). Consistent with MPUC practice, the decision was made during deliberations by oral vote and was finalized in a written order issued in July 2024. 
 The MPUC: 
 Directed OTP to procure the following generation resources, subject to additional regulatory review and approval: 
 200 to 300 megawatts of solar generation by November 1, 2027, or as soon as practicable thereafter, 
 150 to 200 megawatts of wind generation by December 31, 2029, or as soon as practicable thereafter, 
 20 to 75 megawatts of battery storage by December 31, 2029, or as soon as practicable thereafter; 
 Approved the project to add on-site liquified natural gas storage at Astoria Station natural gas plant by 2027; 
 Directed OTP to designate the Minnesota share of the jointly owned Coyote Station coal-fired plant as an Available Maximum Emergency (AME) resource beginning in 2026 and ending no later than December 2031. If the designation as an AME resource is found to not be feasible, then Minnesota customers shall not continue to pay for or depend on capacity or energy from Coyote Station past 2028; and 
 Directed OTP to commence activities to no longer serve Minnesota customers with capacity or energy from Coyote Station as soon as feasible and no later than December 31, 2031. 
 Under the MPUC s order, OTP will file its next IRP in May 2026. In this filing, the company will include, among other options, an analysis considering the continued operation of Big Stone Plant with AME. 
 North Dakota 
 In February 2023, we filed a request for an Advanced Determination of Prudence (ADP) with the NDPSC for the on-site liquified natural gas storage at Astoria Station. Our latest supplemental IRP in North Dakota, which was filed in March 2023, included the on-

 site storage request as well as other investments to meet our customers anticipated capacity and energy needs while maintaining system reliability and low electric service rates. At an informal hearing in July 2024, the NDPSC denied the on-site fuel storage ADP. It remains unclear what action the NDPSC will take on our IRP. 
 ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION 
 In April 2024, the EPA finalized new regulations under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from existing and new fossil fuel-based power plants. The final rule establishes subcategories for new combustion turbines and existing coal-fired power plants to achieve certain carbon dioxide (CO 2 emission reduction levels based on the respective subcategory. For existing coal-fired power plants, the applicable subcategory is based upon the date at which the plant will cease operations. 
 We continue to review and evaluate the final regulations and their impact on our power plants and the potential impact to our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. Coyote Station and Big Stone Plant, our two co-owned coal-fired power plants, are within the scope of the regulations, but we do not believe our combustion turbines would be within the scope of the final regulation. 
 In April 2024, the EPA also finalized regulations to strengthen and update Mercury and Air Toxics Standards for coal-fired power plants, tightening the emission standard for toxic metals and finalizing a reduction standard for mercury from existing lignite-fired sources. The EPA also published a final rule under the Clean Water Act to reduce pollutants discharged through wastewater from coal-fired power plants and a final rule requiring the safe management of coal ash at inactive facilities, including requirements for ongoing monitoring and closure and post-closure care. 
 We continue to review and evaluate these final regulations, and their impact on our operations, which could have a material impact on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. 
 
 LIQUIDITY 
 LIQUIDITY OVERVIEW 
 We believe our financial condition is strong and our cash and cash equivalents, other liquid assets, operating cash flows, existing lines of credit, access to capital markets and borrowing ability, because of investment-grade credit ratings, when taken together, provide us ample liquidity to conduct our business operations, fund our short-term and long-term capital expenditure plans and satisfy our obligations as they become due. Our liquidity, including our operating cash flows and access to capital markets, could be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of our control, including higher interest rates and debt capital costs and diminished credit availability. In addition, our liquidity could be impacted by non-compliance with certain financial covenants under our various debt instruments. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial covenants (see the Financial Covenants section under Capital Resources below). 
 The following table presents the status of our lines of credit as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 
 2024 2023 (in thousands) Borrowing Limit Amount Outstanding Letters of Credit Amount Available Amount Available OTC Credit Agreement 170,000 170,000 170,000 OTP Credit Agreement 170,000 67,401 8,772 93,827 79,446 Total 340,000 67,401 8,772 263,827 249,446 
 OTC and OTP are each party to separate credit agreements (the OTC Credit Agreement and OTP Credit Agreement, respectively) which provide for unsecured revolving lines of credit. Should additional liquidity be needed, the OTC Credit Agreement includes an accordion feature allowing us to increase the amount available to 290 million, subject to certain terms and conditions. The OTP Credit Agreement also includes an accordion feature allowing OTP to increase that facility to 250 million, subject to certain terms and conditions. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 263.8 million of available liquidity under our credit facilities and 280.0 million of available cash and cash equivalents, resulting in total available liquidity of 543.8 million, compared to total available liquidity of 468.1million as of September 30, 2023.

 CASH FLOWS 
 The following is a discussion of our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 (in thousands) 2024 2023 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 322,775 318,495 
 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities increased 4.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in net income driven by increased earnings from our Plastics segment, partially offset by increased working capital at our Manufacturing segment. 
 (in thousands) 2024 2023 Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 312,166 232,018 
 Net Cash Used in Investing Activities increased 80.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a 50.1 million investment in U.S. treasuries made to secure a fixed rate of return until their maturity in September 2026, and an increase in capital expenditures in 2024. Capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included additional investments in our wind repowering and advanced meter infrastructure projects, as well as continued investments in our manufacturing facility expansion projects in Arizona and Georgia. 
 (in thousands) 2024 2023 Net Cash Provided by (Used In) Financing Activities 
 39,038 (16,259) 
 Net Cash Provided by (Used In) Financing Activities increased 55.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included the issuance of 120.0 million of long-term debt at OTP, the proceeds of which were used to repay short-term borrowings under the OTP credit agreement, fund Electric segment construction expenditures, and support operating activities. We manage the capital structure of OTP independent from our consolidated financial position to ensure compliance with the capital structure approved through regulation; therefore, our decision to issue long-term debt at OTP is not impacted by our consolidated cash and cash equivalent position. 
 Financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 also included net short-term borrowings of 14.0 million and dividend payments of 58.7 million. Financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included net short-term borrowings of 43.3 million and dividend payments of 54.8 million. 
 
 CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS 
 
 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES 
 Our capital expenditure plan includes investments in electric generation facilities, transmission and distribution lines, manufacturing facilities and upgrades, equipment used in the manufacturing process, and computer hardware and information systems. Our capital expenditure plan is subject to review and is revised in light of changes in demands for energy, technology, environmental laws, regulatory changes, business expansion opportunities, the costs of labor, materials and equipment and our financial condition. Refer to Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for our capital expenditure plans for the five year period from 2024 through 2028. 
 
 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS 
 Our contractual obligations primarily include principal and interest payments due under our outstanding debt obligations, commitments to acquire coal, energy and capacity commitments, payments to meet our postretirement benefit obligations, and payment obligations under land easements and leasing arrangements. 
 Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2023 are included in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There were no material changes in our contractual obligations outside of the ordinary course of business during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, except for the obligation described below. 
 On October 30, 2024, OTP entered into an agreement to acquire the assets of a solar facility currently under development. Per the agreement, the purchase price is equal to 23.6 million, plus the reimbursement of certain interconnection costs and costs to purchase and store the main power transformer. Closing of the transaction is expected to occur in the second half of 2025.

 COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS 
 We paid dividends to our shareholders totaling 58.7 million, or 1.4025 per share, in the first nine months of 2024. The determination of the amount of future cash dividends to be paid will depend on, among other things, our financial condition, our actual or expected level of earnings and cash flows from operations, the level of our capital expenditures and our future business prospects. As a result of certain statutory limitations or regulatory or financing agreements, the amount of dividends we are allowed to pay could be restricted. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. The decision to declare dividends is reviewed quarterly by our Board of Directors. 
 
 CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Financial flexibility is provided by operating cash flows, unused lines of credit and access to capital markets, and is aided by strong financial coverages and investment grade credit ratings. Debt financing will be required in the next five years to refinance maturing debt and to finance our capital investments. Our financing plans are subject to change and are impacted by our planned level of capital investments, and decisions to reduce borrowings under our lines of credit, to refund or retire early any of our outstanding debt, to complete acquisitions, or to use capital for other corporate purposes. 
 REGISTRATION STATEMENTS 
 On May 3, 2024, we filed two registration statements with the SEC, replacing two previously filed registration statements upon their expiration. The first statement, a shelf registration, allows us to offer for sale, from time to time, either separately or together in any combination, equity, debt or other securities described in the registration statement. No new debt or equity has been issued pursuant to the registration statement. The second registration statement allows for the issuance of up to 1,500,000 common shares under our Automatic Dividend Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan, which provides our common shareholders, retail customers of OTP and other interested investors a method of purchasing our common shares by reinvesting their dividends and/or making optional cash investments. Shares purchased under the plan may be newly issued common shares or common shares purchased on the open market. As of September 30, 2024, there were 1,453,913 shares available for purchase or issuance under the plan. Both registration statements expire in May 2027. 
 SHORT-TERM DEBT 
 OTC and OTP are each party to a credit agreement (the OTC Credit Agreement and the OTP Credit Agreement, respectively) which each provides for unsecured revolving lines of credit. The following is a summary of key provisions and borrowing information as of, and for the nine months ended, September 30, 2024: 
 (in thousands, except interest rates) OTC Credit Agreement OTP Credit Agreement Borrowing Limit 170,000 170,000 Borrowing Limit if Accordion Exercised 1

 6.35 6.29 Maturity Date October 29, 2027 October 29, 2027 1 Each facility includes an accordion featuring allowing the borrower to increase the borrowing limit if certain terms and conditions are met. 
 
 LONG-TERM DEBT 
 In March 2024, OTP entered into a Note Purchase Agreement pursuant to which OTP issued, in a private placement transaction, 120.0 million of senior unsecured notes consisting of (a) 60.0 million of 5.48 Series 2024A Senior Unsecured Notes due April 1, 2034, and (b) 60.0 million of 5.77 Series 2024B Senior Unsecured Notes due April 1, 2054. The proceeds of the notes were used to repay existing short-term borrowings, fund capital expenditures, and for general corporate purposes. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 947.0 million of principal outstanding under long-term debt arrangements. These instruments generally provide for unsecured borrowings at fixed rates of interest with maturities ranging from 2026 to 2054. Note 7 to our 
 34 

Table of Contents 

 consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes additional information regarding these short-term and long-term debt instruments. 
 Financial Covenants 
 Certain of our short- and long-term debt agreements require OTC and OTP to maintain certain financial covenants. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with these financial covenants as further described below: 
 OTC, under its financial covenants, may not permit its ratio of interest-bearing debt to total capitalization to exceed 0.60 to 1.00, may not permit its interest and dividend coverage ratio to be less than 1.50 to 1.00, and may not permit its priority indebtedness to exceed 10 percent of its total capitalization. As of September 30, 2024, OTC's interest-bearing debt to total capitalization was 0.38 to 1.00, OTC's interest and dividend coverage ratio was 10.4 to 1.00, and OTC had no priority indebtedness outstanding. 
 OTP, under its financial covenants, may not permit its ratio of interest-bearing debt to total capitalization to exceed 0.60 to 1.00, may not permit its interest and dividend coverage ratio to be less than 1.50 to 1.00, and may not permit its priority indebtedness to exceed 20 percent of its total capitalization. As of September 30, 2024, OTP's interest-bearing debt to total capitalization was 0.48 to 1.00, OTP's interest and dividend coverage ratio was 3.27 to 1.00, and OTP had no priority indebtedness outstanding. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES INVOLVING SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES 
 The discussion and analysis of our results of operations are based on financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Certain of our accounting policies require management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We have disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 the critical accounting policies that affect our most significant estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed in the most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K . 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 There have been no material changes in our market risk from those disclosed in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act)) as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting . There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 On August 23, 2024, a class action complaint was filed against certain PVC pipe manufacturers, including Otter Tail Corporation, alleging, among other things, that the defendants conspired to fix, raise, maintain, and stabilize the price of PVC municipal water and electrical conduit pipe in violation of United States antitrust laws. Subsequently, additional class action lawsuits making similar claims were filed, and on October 30, 2024, the plaintiffs filed consolidated complaints against the named PVC pipe manufacturers, including Otter Tail Corporation. This matter is further described in Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies , to the consolidated financial statements.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 There have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, except for the risk factors below. 
 Legislation, regulation, litigation or other actions related to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions could materially impact us. 
 Current and future federal, state, regional and international regulations to address global climate change and reduce GHG emissions, including measures such as mandated levels of renewable generation, mandatory reductions in CO 2 emission levels, taxes on CO 2 emissions, or cap-and-trade regimes, could require us to incur significant costs which could negatively impact our financial condition, operating results and liquidity if such costs cannot be recovered through rates granted by rate-making authorities or through increased market prices for electricity. 
 In April 2024, the EPA finalized new regulations under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act to regulate GHG emissions from existing and new fossil fuel-based power plants. The new regulations require existing coal-fired power plants to achieve certain CO 2 emissions reduction levels, with the amount of reduction dependent upon the remaining operating life of the facility. The new regulation has the potential to materially impact the operations of our coal-fired power plants, which could have a material impact on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. 
 In addition to complying with legislation and regulation, we could be subject to litigation related to climate change. If we were subjected to such litigation, the costs of such litigation could be significant and an adverse outcome could require substantial capital expenditures, changes in operations and possible payment of penalties or damages which could affect our financial condition, operating results and liquidity if the costs are not recoverable in rates or covered by insurance. 
 Claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings may adversely affect our business, operating results and liquidity. 
 We are periodically subject to actual and threatened claims, litigation, investigations, and other proceedings, including proceedings by governments and regulatory authorities, involving utilities regulation, competition and antitrust, product quality matters, and liability claims. 
 Any of these proceedings, including the currently ongoing proceedings related to our Plastics segment businesses, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results and liquidity. It is possible that a resolution of one or more proceedings, including as a result of a settlement, could involve damages, sanctions, consent decrees, or orders requiring us to make substantial future payments, prevent us from offering certain products or services, require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, otherwise disrupt our business, divert management resources, damage our reputation, or otherwise have a material effect on our operations. The outcomes of these matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. 
 
 ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 Purchases of Otter Tail Corporation common shares were made on the open market during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as follows: Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs (2) 
 Maximum Number (or Approximate Dollar Value) of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (2)
