Company
Overview 

PNRL
is a mineral exploration and evaluation company focused on the discovery and advancement of high-quality nickel-copper-cobalt-platinum
group metals Ni-Cu-Co-PGM resources. The principal assets of the Company are the Selebi and Selebi North nickel-copper-cobalt Ni-Cu-Co mines in Botswana and related infrastructure (together, the Selebi Mines ), as well as the
nickel, copper, cobalt, platinum-group elements Ni-Cu-Co-PGE Selkirk mine in Botswana, together with associated
infrastructure and four surrounding prospecting licenses (collectively, the Selkirk Mine and together with the Selebi
Mines, the Mines ). PNRL is committed to governance through transparency, accountability, and open communication
within PNRL s team and stakeholders. 

4 

The
Company s principal business activity is the exploration and evaluation of the Mines. 

The
Mines are permitted with 10-year mining licences and benefit from significant local infrastructure. The Company s flagship Selebi
Mines includes two operational shafts, the Selebi and Selebi North shafts, and related infrastructure such as rail, power and roads. 

PNRL
is headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and is publicly traded on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol PNRL . 

Summary
of Activities 

In
2023, PNRL commenced its Phase 2 drill program undertaking a combination of resource and continued exploration drilling at the Selebi
Mines to demonstrate the size potential of the Selebi Mines mineral system, with the aim of establishing an initial mineral resource
estimate MRE on the Selebi Mines (the Initial MRE that will serve as the basis for future
engineering studies. The resource drilling at the Selebi Mines commenced underground from the Selebi North infrastructure in August 2023
and is currently ongoing with three drills turning. Assay results for completed holes are released as they are received and confirmed
by the Company. 

On
September 20, 2024, the Company filed the Initial MRE for its Selebi Mines in accordance with Canadian standards. The Initial MRE reflects
a significant expansion of the 2016 historic estimate. 

During
the third quarter and up to November 10, 2024, the Company has drilled approximately 17,167 metres in 36 holes at Selebi North. Assays
for a total of 30,915 metres across 71 completed holes, with 3 more in progress, have not been accounted for in the Initial MRE. These
assay results will continue to be released as they are received and confirmed by the Company. 

The
Company plans to continue its work at the Selkirk Mine and its surrounding prospecting licences, which is the Company s second
asset in Botswana, located approximately 75 kilometres north of the Selebi Mines. The focus of this work will be to understand the legacy
work done by previous owners, which had advanced the Selkirk Mine to a bankable feasibility study for re-development as an open pit mine. 

The
Company s Q3 2024 activities included a re-sampling program of historical drill core to support a MRE in respect of the Selkirk
Mine, anticipated to be delivered in Q4 2024. In 2023, the Company completed test work to evaluate an alternative ore processing and
tailings management strategy to those used in previous economic studies, the results of which are set forth in the Selkirk Technical
Report (as defined herein). 

For
more information relating to the contemplated activities and milestones for the Mines, please see Exploration and Evaluation
Activities below.

Selebi
Mines, Botswana 

The
Selebi Mines are located in Botswana approximately 150 km southeast of the city of Francistown, and 410 km northeast of the national
capital Gaborone. The Selebi Mines are readily accessed via paved and gravel roads from the town of Selebi-Phikwe, located just north
of the mining licence. With a population of approximately 52,000, the town is accessed via a well-maintained paved road that branches
due east from the major A1 highway at the town of Serule, 57 km from the Selebi Mines. 

The
Selebi Mines infrastructure includes two mines that are currently on care and maintenance, Selebi (#2 Shaft) and Selebi North (#4 Shaft),
and associated surface infrastructure. 

The
Selebi Mines consists of a single mining licence covering an area of 11,504 hectares. The mining licence is centred approximately at
22 03 00 S and 27 47 00 E. 

Mining
licence 2022/1L was granted to Premium Nickel Resources Proprietary Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of PNRL in Botswana, on January
31, 2022 over the Selebi Mines deposits discovered under mining licence 4/72. The original licence which had been granted to BCL Limited BCL on March 7, 1972, covered both Selebi and Phikwe project areas, was amended several times and renewed once,
and was set to expire on March 6, 2022. The new mining licence is limited to the Selebi and Selebi North deposits and their surrounding
areas and expires May 26, 2032. 

On
August 8, 2024, the Company announced the results of the Initial MRE at the Selebi Mines, prepared in accordance with Canadian requirements. 

Exploration 

Exploration
work completed at the Selebi Mines from 2021 to October 2024 consisted of the sourcing and digitization of existing historical information,
confirming collar and down hole location information of selected historical holes, and drilling. PNRL also completed gyro, electromagnetic
surveys BHEM ), televiewer, and downhole physical property surveys on selected high priority historical and recent
exploration holes. A focused structural model over a portion of the Selebi deposit was developed by SRK Consulting Ltd. SRK ),
and a 3D model of mineralization for use in targeting was created at Selebi North by SLR. 

In
August 2023, an underground drilling program at Selebi North was initiated, which is currently active with three drills turning. As of
November 10, 2024, a total of 60,899 metres has been completed in 156 holes from eight underground drill bays, with three of those holes
currently in progress. This new drilling is a combination of infill and exploration drilling to follow the extension of the mineralization
down dip and down plunge. The core is sampled and sent to ALS Chemex in Johannesburg for analysis. Assay results are reported as they
are received. All holes are surveyed with a gyro instrument and selected holes are surveyed with borehole electromagnetics. To date,
a total of 59 underground holes have been surveyed.

Mineral
Processing and Metallurgical Testing 

The
historical BCL operations consisted of an integrated mining, concentrating and smelting complex which operated for over 40 years over
the Selebi Phikwe project area. The smelter processed Selebi and Phikwe concentrates and toll treated nickel concentrates received from
the Nkomati Nickel Mine and the Phoenix Mine. The concentrator plant and smelter were placed on care and maintenance in 2016 and are
located adjacent to the Selebi Mines at the historical Phikwe Mine. 

PNRL intends to use pre-concentration
methods to separate the minerals from waste materials to produce a mill feed and flotation to produce a concentrate for commercial sale,
or for further refining, and does not plan to restart the existing concentrator or smelter. Concentrate options will be investigated
in the next phase of work and include a bulk concentrate and separate nickel and copper concentrates. In 2021, PNRL carried out due diligence
work that included metallurgical sampling and testing. Metallurgical study programs were carried out by SGS Canada Inc. SGS in Lakefield, Ontario in 2021 and 2023 for separate copper and nickel concentrate production at a conceptual level. The conceptual process
flowsheet developed by SGS includes the key unit operations of crushing, grinding, and flotation.

PNRL
and DRA collaborated in the analyses of historical data collected on key flotation parameters observed in the production of separate
nickel and copper concentrates, such as metal upgrade ratios and mass pull, to simulate estimated metal grades and recoveries for bulk
concentrate. 

Selkirk
Mine, Botswana 

The
Selkirk Mine is located in the northeast of Botswana approximately 28 km southeast of the city of Francistown, and 450 km northeast of
the national capital Gaborone. 

The
Selkirk Mine is accessed year-round via paved and gravel roads from Gaborone and Francistown. The Selkirk Mine infrastructure includes
relict surface infrastructure supporting the historical underground mine, and the original decline. The Selkirk Mine is quite flat, and
beyond the mine footprint is covered in grassland with dispersed and clustered trees typical of a tree savanna biome. 

The
Selkirk Mine consists of a single mining licence covering an area of 1,458 hectares (14.58 km2) and four prospecting licences covering
a total of 12,670 hectares (126.7 km2). The mining licence, 2022/7L, is centred approximately at 21 19 13 S and 27 44 17 
E and is held by PNGPL, a subsidiary of PNRL. The mining licence was renewed for ten years commencing on May 27, 2022, ending on May
26, 2032. The four prospecting licences (PL050/2010, PL051/2010, PL210/2010, and PL071/2011) are currently being renewed and are expected
to be valid to September 30, 2026. 

Exploration 

Exploration
work completed by PNRL to date has consisted of the sourcing and digitization of existing historical information, confirming collar location
information on selected historical holes, re-logging selected drill core, sampling mineralized drill core found untouched on surface,
and submitting a number of samples for proof-of-concept metallurgical testing. PNRL has engaged SLR to complete an MRE. Following the
data verification exercise, the Company has resampled core in from 17 holes to obtain additional PGM analyses to be used in the MRE at
the Selkirk Mine. Re-sampled core was sent to ALS Chemex in Johannesburg for analysis.

Exploration
programs have also been ongoing at the prospecting licences located adjacent to the Selkirk mining licence, with a differential Global
Positioning System of seven historical drillhole collars and two surface electromagnetics surveys completed in Q2 2024. The strongest
electromagnetic anomaly occurs over the Rooikoppie Prospect, a gossan that was targeted by BCL drill holes. These five holes were located,
Differential Global Positioning System coordinates collected, and two holes, DRKP001 and 002, were sampled in Q3 2024. Assays showed
no significant results in Ni, Cu, or PGEs. 

Mineral
Processing and Metallurgical Testing 

PNRL
intends to use flotation to produce a concentrate for commercial sale or for further refining. Concentrate options will be investigated
in the next phase of work and include a bulk concentrate and separate nickel and copper concentrates. Metallurgical study programs were
carried out by SGS in Lakefield, Ontario in 2021 and 2023 for separate copper and nickel concentrate production at a conceptual level.
The conceptual process flowsheet developed by SGS includes the key unit operations of crushing, grinding, and flotation. 

PNRL
analyzed select SGS test results on key flotation parameters observed in the production of separate nickel and copper concentrates to
simulate estimated metal grades and recoveries for bulk concentrate. The area is in a rural district and the available infrastructure
is minimal. Strategic services (e.g., electricity and water supplies) could be provided by the Botswana Power Corporation and from existing
governmental water pipelines within the Francistown Road Reserve, and potable water could be sourced on site from boreholes. A railway
line crosses the western margin of the Selkirk area. 

Maniitsoq
Nickel-Copper-PGM Project, Southwest Greenland 

The
Maniitsoq project is centred on the 75 kilometre by 15 kilometre Greenland Norite Belt which hosts numerous high-grade nickel-copper
sulphide occurrences associated with mafic and ultramafic intrusions. The property is located 100 kilometres north of Nuuk, the capital
of Greenland, and is accessible year-round either by helicopter or by boat from Nuuk or Maniitsoq, the latter located on the coast approximately
15 kilometres to the west. The Company acquired the Maniitsoq project in 2011 due to its potential for the discovery of significant magmatic
sulfide deposits in a camp-scale belt. The Maniitsoq property consists of three exploration licences, Sulussagut No. 2011/54 and Ininngui
No. 2012/28, comprising 2,182 and 110.9 square kilometres, respectively, and the Carbonatite property No. 2018/21 (63 square kilometres),
and a prospecting licence, No. 2020/05, for West Greenland. The Greenland properties have no mineral resources or reserves. Mineral exploration
licence MEL 2018/21 and prospecting licence 2020/05 are in effect until December 31, 2024. MEL 2011/54 expires
December 31, 2025, while MEL 2012/28 expires December 31, 2026. 

Exploration
Activities 

Remaining
targets were reviewed and prioritized in preparation for a potential field program in 2023, which was deferred. No exploration work was
carried out in Greenland to date in 2024. 

No
material expenditures or activities are contemplated on the Maniitsoq property at this time.

Canadian
Nickel Projects - Sudbury, Ontario 

Post
Creek Property 

The
Post Creek property is located 35 kilometres east of Sudbury in Norman, Parkin, Alymer and Rathburn townships and consists of 73 unpatented
mining claim cells in two separate blocks, covering a total area of 912 hectares held by the Company. The Company acquired the property
through an option agreement in April 2010, which was subsequently amended in March 2013. As at the date of this MD A, the Company
holds a 100 interest in the Post Creek property and is obligated to pay advances on a net smelter return of 10,000 per annum, which
will be deducted from any payments to be made under the net smelter return. 

The
Post Creek property lies adjacent to the Whistle Offset Dyke Structure which hosts the past producing Whistle Offset and Podolsky
Cu-Ni-PGM mines. Post Creek lies along an interpreted northeast extension of the corridor containing the Whistle Offset Dyke and Footwall
deposits and accounts for a significant portion of all ore mined in the Sudbury nickel district and, as such, represents favourable exploration
targets. Key lithologies are Quartz Diorite and metabreccia related to offset dykes and Sudbury Breccia associated with Footwall rocks
of the Sudbury Igneous Complex which both represent potential controls on mineralization. 

No
exploration work was completed to date in 2024 on the Post Creek Property. The claims have sufficient work credits to keep them in good
standing until 2027. No material expenditures or activities are contemplated on the Post Creek property at this time. 

Halcyon
Property 

The
Halcyon property is located 35 kilometres northeast of Sudbury in the Parkin and Aylmer townships and consists of 63 unpatented mining
cells for a total of 864 hectares. Halcyon is adjacent to the Post Creek property and is approximately 2 kilometres north of the producing
Podolsky Mine of FNX Mining. The property was acquired through an option agreement and as at the date of this MD A, the Company holds
a 100 interest in the Halcyon property and is obligated to pay advances on a net smelter return of 8,000 per annum, which will be deducted
from any payments to be made under the net smelter return. 

No
exploration work was completed on the Halcyon Property to date in 2024. The claims are in good standing through 2027. No material expenditures
or activities are contemplated on the Halcyon property at this time. 

Quetico
Property 

The
Quetico property is located within the Thunder Bay Mining District of Ontario and in January 2024 consisted of 99 claim cells in two
blocks. Cells were acquired to assess: (a) the Quetico Sub-province corridor, which hosts intrusions with Ni-Cu-Co-PGM mineralization
related to a late 2690 Ma Archean magmatic event; and (b) the Neoproterozoic (1100 Ma MCR) magmatic event and related intrusions. 

No
work was carried out on the Quetico property in 2024. The last remaining claims expired on April 26, 2024. 

Financial
Capability 

The
Company, being in the exploration stage, is subject to risks and challenges similar to companies in a comparable stage of exploration
and development. These risks include the challenges of securing adequate capital for exploration and advancement of the Company s
material projects, operational risks inherent in the mining industry, and global economic and metal price volatility, and there is no
assurance management will be successful in its endeavors. As at September 30, 2024, the Company had no source of operating cash flows,
nor any credit line currently in place. 

As
at September 30, 2024, the Company had working capital (calculated as total current assets less total current liabilities) of 15,092,693
(December 31, 2023 14,999,619) and reported an accumulated deficit of 135,712,148 (December 31, 2023 104,566,816). 

As
at September 30, 2024, the Company had 17,358,377 in available cash (December 31, 2023 19,245,628). There are no sources of
operating cash flows. The properties in which the Company currently has an interest are in the pre-revenue stage. As such, the Company
is dependent on external financing to fund its activities. In order to carry out the planned development and cover administrative costs,
the Company will need to use its existing working capital and raise additional amounts as needed. Subject to any changes in the Company s
operational plan, the Company has the funds to complete its planned mineral resource estimate for the Selkirk Mine, and to advance underground
exploration drilling and studies at the Selebi Mines into the first half of 2025. Although the Company has been successful in its past
fundraising activities, there is no assurance as to the success of future fundraising efforts or as to the sufficiency of funds raised
in the future.

net loss of 22,199,513 largely due to increased exploration activities relating to the Botswana assets, the interest expense on a three-year
term loan (the Term Loan with Cymbria Corporation Cymbria ), and an increase in share-based
payments. 

Total
Assets 

Total
assets as at September 30, 2024 decreased by 682,137 from the December 31, 2023 balance. Lower cash balances in the current period and
depreciation of property, plant and equipment were largely offset by the purchase of spare parts from BCL. 

Current
Liabilities and Non-Current Financial Liabilities 

Current
liabilities as at September 30, 2024 decreased by 311,473 from December 31, 2023 due to a decrease in lease liabilities resulting from
the repayment of interest and principal on the Syringa Lodge lease. Non-current financial liabilities as at September 30, 2024 increased
by 798,200 from December 31, 2023 as a result of the accretion of costs associated with the Term Loan. 

Overall
Performance and Results of Operations 

As
at the date of this Report, the Company has not earned revenue nor proved the economic viability of its projects. The Company s
expenses are not subject to seasonal fluctuations or general trends other than factors affecting costs such as inflation and input prices.
The Company s expenses and cash requirements will fluctuate from period to period depending on the level of activity at the projects,
which may be influenced by the Company s ability to raise capital to fund these activities. Comparisons of activity made between
periods should be viewed with this in mind. The Company s quarterly results may be affected by many factors such as timing of exploration
activity, share-based payment costs, capital raised, marketing activities and other factors that affect the Company s exploration,
evaluation and re-development activities. 

The
following table summarizes the Company s Operations for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and September

General
 and administrative expenses increased by 378,133 and 406,157 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,
 mainly due to higher travel and marketing costs as well as higher professional fees relating to additional regulatory reporting requirements
 in 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 2,708,304 of the general and administrative expenses were related to management
 fees, office costs, insurance fees, consulting fees, and various other overhead expenses at the Mines (nine months ended September
 30, 2023 - 2,694,115). 

Depreciation
 increased by 203,081 and 847,223 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, due to property,
 plant and equipment acquisitions in late 2023 which started to depreciate in 2024. 

General
 exploration expenses increased by 2,988,188 and 5,345,605 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,
 as the Company ramped-up drilling, geophysics, engineering, and other activities at the Mines over the year. 

Share-based
 payments represents the Company s long-term incentive program compensation granted to employees, directors, officers and
 consultants. Share-based payment was 933,619 and 1,712,843 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,
 compared to nil in 2023. 

DSUs
 granted, net , or deferred share units, represents the Company s long-term incentive program compensation granted to directors
 of the Company, net of period end mark to market adjustments. The decrease of 87,926 and 149,934 for the three and nine months
 ended September 30, 2024, respectively, is due to downward mark to market adjustments on outstanding units resulting from a decrease
 in the Company s share price, partially offset by an increase in size of the Board of Directors. 

Interest
 income and expense represents interest income earned on cash and cash equivalent deposits and interest expense on the Company s
 lease liabilities. Net interest income increased by 150,568 and 217,839 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,
 respectively, as the Company held higher cash balances arising from the June 2024 Financing in guaranteed investment certificates.
 Further, the final installment on the drilling equipment lease was paid in April 2024, resulting in lower interest expense for the
 current year periods. 

Interest
 and financing cost on debt comprises the accrued interest on the Company s debt instruments, as well as the accretion of
 related transaction costs and fees. The increase of 68,732 and 906,354 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,
 respectively, relates to the additional 5.9 million of principal on the Term Loan that was added in December 2023.

Operating
Activities 

Net
cash used in operating activities YTD 2024 increased by 3,454,621 compared to YTD 2023, a result of a ramp-up in drilling, geophysics,
engineering, and other activities at the Mines over the year. 

13 

Investing
Activities 

Key
investing activities relate to the acquisition of property, plant and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities YTD 2024 decreased
by 3,231,309 compared to YTD 2023. The higher spending in YTD 2023 was related to the upfront purchase of tools and parts for the three
drills which were leased in 2023. 

Financing
Activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities YTD 2024 decreased by 5,287,994 compared to YTD 2023. During the first nine months of 2023, the
Company obtained a term loan for gross proceeds of approximately 15.0 million and closed private placements for gross proceeds of approximately
 24.0 million, using a portion of those funds to repay a 7.0 million promissory note from Pinnacle Island LP. During the first nine
months of 2024, the Company closed private placements for gross proceeds of approximately 27.5 million, and had no additional borrowings. 

Liquidity 

Capital
Resources 

As
at September 30, 2024, the Company had 17,358,377 in available cash (December 31, 2023 19,245,628). The Company has no sources
of operating cash flows. Subject to any changes in the Company s operational plan, the Company has the funds to complete its planned
mineral resource estimate for the Selkirk Mine, and to advance underground exploration drilling and studies at the Selebi Mines into
the first half of 2025. Given the Company s current financial position and the ongoing exploration and evaluation expenditures,
the Company will need to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity or other available financing alternatives to continue
funding its operating, exploration and evaluation activities, and re-development of its mineral properties. Although the Company has
been successful in its past fund-raising activities, there is no assurance as to the success of future fundraising efforts or as to the
sufficiency of funds raised in the future. 

Going
Concern 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred a loss of 12,004,960 and reported an accumulated deficit of 135,712,148
as at September 30, 2024 (December 31, 2023 104,566,816). At the end of Q3 2024, the Company required additional funds to continue
its planned operations and meet its future obligations, commitments and forecasted expenditures through September 30, 2025. Management
is aware, in making its assessment, of material uncertainties related to events and conditions that may cast a substantial doubt upon
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern, and accordingly, the appropriateness of the use of accounting principles
applicable to a going concern. The accompanying Financial Statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and
classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities, and the reported expenses and comprehensive loss that might
be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. These adjustments could be material. In assessing whether a
going concern assumption is appropriate, management considers all available information about the future, which is at least, but not
limited to, twelve months from the end of the reporting period. 

Financings 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company completed the following financing transactions: 

On
June 14, 2024, the Company closed the first tranche of the June 2024 Financing, pursuant to which the Company issued an aggregate 19,234,614

a Warrant ). 

Each
Warrant entitles the holder thereof to acquire one Common Share for a period expiring 60 months following the date of issuance (the Expiry
Date at a price of 1.10 per Common Share. If, at any time prior to the Expiry Date, the volume-weighted average trading
price of the Common Shares is at least 2.00 per Common Share for a period of 20 trading days, the Company may, at its option, accelerate
the Expiry Date with 30 days notice to the Warrant holders. 

On
June 21, 2024, the Company closed the second tranche of the June 2024 Financing and issued an additional 16,021,795 Units at the Issue

approximately 27.5 million. 

The
net proceeds of the June 2024 Financing will be used by the Company to advance the exploration and development of the Mines in Botswana
and for general corporate and working capital purposes. See Use of Proceeds for more details. 

14 

On
December 14, 2023, the Company closed a financing (the December 2023 Financing comprised of a brokered private
placement of units (the Private Placement and an amended Term Loan. The Private Placement was entered into by the
Company with Cormark Securities Inc. and BMO Capital Markets, as co-lead agents, and Canaccord Genuity Corp., Fort Capital Securities
Ltd. and Paradigm Capital Inc. Under the Private Placement, the Company issued an aggregate of 13,133,367 Common Shares at a price of
 1.20 per Common Share for aggregate gross proceeds of 15,760,040. The principal amount of the Term Loan was increased by 5,882,353

at September 30, 2024, the Company had a positive working capital of 15,092,693 (December 31, 2023 14,999,619). The marginal
increase in working capital is mainly due to an increase in spare parts inventory, partially offset by a decrease in lease liabilities. 

Contractual
Obligations and Contingencies 

Selebi
Mines 

As
per the Selebi APA, the aggregate purchase price payable to the seller for the Selebi Mines is the sum of USD 56,750,000 which amount
shall be paid in three instalments: 

USD
 1,750,000 payable on the closing date, and payment of care and maintenance funding contributions in respect of the Selebi Mines from
 March 22, 2021 to the closing date of USD 5,178,747. These payments have been made. 

15 

USD
 25,000,000 upon the earlier of: (a) approval by the Botswana Ministry of Mineral Resources, Green Technology and Energy Security
 MMRGTES of the Company s Section 42 and Section 43 applications (for the further extension of the mining
 licence and conversion of the mining licence into an operating licence, respectively); and (b) on the expiry date of the study phase,
 January 31, 2026, which pursuant to the Selebi APA has been extended for one year from the original expiry date of January 31, 2025.
 This extension follows successful completion by the Company of the work and investment milestones required by the Selebi APA. 

The
 third instalment of USD 30,000,000 is payable on the completion of mine construction and production start-up by the Company on or
 before January 31, 2030, but not later than four years after the approval by the Minister of MMRGTES of the Company s Section
 42 and Section 43 applications. 

As
per the terms and conditions of the Selebi APA, the Company has the option to cancel the second and third payments and return the Selebi
Mines to the liquidator if the Company determines that the Selebi Mines are not economical. The Company also has an option to pay in
advance the second and third payments if the Company determines that the Selebi Mines are economical. The Company s accounting
policy is to measure and record contingent consideration when the conditions associated with the contingency are met. As of September
30, 2024, none of the conditions of the second and third instalments have been met, hence these amounts are not accrued in the Financial
Statements. 

In
addition to the Selebi APA, the purchase of the Selebi Mines is also subject to a contingent compensation agreement as well as a royalty
agreement with the liquidator. 

Phikwe
South and the Southeast Extension 

In
August 2023, the Company announced that it had entered into a binding commitment letter with the liquidator of BCL to acquire a 100 
interest in two additional deposits, Phikwe South the Southeast Extension, located adjacent to and immediately north of the Selebi North
historical workings. The acquisition of the Phikwe South and the Southeast Extension deposits is subject to customary closing conditions
and is expected to close in Q4 2024. 

The
upfront cost to the Company to acquire these additional mineral properties is US 1,000,000. In addition, the Company has agreed to additional
work commitments of US 5,000,000 in the aggregate over the next four years. As a result of the extension of the Selebi mining licence,
the remaining asset purchase obligations of the Company outlined in the Selebi APA will each increase by 10 , US 5,500,000 in total,
while the trigger events remain unchanged. 

Selkirk
Mine 

In
regard to the Selkirk Mine, the purchase agreement does not provide for a purchase price or initial payment for the purchase of the assets.
The Selkirk purchase agreement provides that if the Company elects to develop Selkirk first, the payment of the second Selebi instalment
of US 25 million would be due upon the approval by the Minister of MMRGTES of the Company s Section 42 and Section 43 applications
(for the further extension of the Selkirk mining licence and conversion of the Selkirk mining licence into an operating licence, respectively).
For the third Selebi instalment of US 30 million, if Selkirk were commissioned earlier than Selebi, the payment would trigger on Selkirk s
commission date. 

Right-of-Use
Assets 

On
July 9, 2022, the Company executed a sales agreement with Tuli Tourism Pty Ltd. the Seller for the Syringa Lodge
in Botswana and obtained possession of the property in August 2022. Pursuant to the agreement, the aggregate purchase price payable to
the Seller shall be the sum of 3,213,404 (BWP 30,720,000), payable in three installments. A deposit of 482,011 (BWP 4,608,000) was
paid in August 2022, and a second installment of 1,306,906 (BWP 13,056,000) was paid in July 2023. On September 12, 2024, the sales
agreement was amended and the Company paid 50 of the final installment of 653,061 (BWP 6,528,000) with the remaining balance of 665,203
(BWP 6,528,000) due on November 30, 2024. Title of the asset transfers to the Company upon payment of the remaining balance. All other
terms and conditions remained the same. 

On
March 14, 2023, the Company entered into a drilling equipment supply agreement with Forage Fusion Drilling Ltd. Forage of Hawkesbury, Ontario to purchase specific drilling equipment on a rent to own basis with the purchase price to be paid
in monthly payments. Pursuant to the agreement, the aggregate purchase price payable to Forage is 2,942,000. A payment of 1,700,000
was paid in March 2023 to purchase all the tooling, diamonds and critical spares required for 32,000 metres of drilling. The balance,
covering the purchase of the drills, was payable in twelve equal monthly instalments of 103,500. The equipment arrived at the site in
July 2023 and is now 100 owned by PNRL. 

Post
Creek 

Commencing
August 1, 2015, the Company is obligated to pay advances on the Post Creek net smelter return of 10,000 per annum. To date in 2024,
the Company paid 10,000, which will be deducted from any payments to be made under the net smelter return. 

16 

Halcyon 

Commencing
August 1, 2015, the Company is obligated to pay advances on the Halcyon net smelter return of 8,000 per annum. To date in 2024, the
Company paid 8,000, which will be deducted from any payments to be made under the net smelter return. 

Contingencies 

There
are no environmental liabilities associated with the Mines as at the acquisition dates as all liabilities incurred prior to the acquisitions
are the responsibility of the sellers, BCL and TNMC, respectively. The Company has an obligation for the rehabilitation costs arising
subsequent to the acquisitions. As of September 30, 2024, management is not aware of or anticipating any contingent liabilities that
could impact the financial position or performance of the Company related to its exploration and evaluation assets. 

The
Company s exploration and evaluation assets are affected by the laws and environmental regulations that exist in the various jurisdictions
in which the Company operates. It is not possible to estimate the future contingent liabilities and the impact on the Company s
operating results due to future changes in the Company s re-development of its projects or future changes in such laws and environmental
regulations.
