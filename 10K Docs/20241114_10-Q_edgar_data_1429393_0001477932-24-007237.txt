Trutankless Products Our trutankless water heaters were designed to provide an endless hot water supply because they are designed to heat water as it flows through the system. We believe that our products have an improved design and greater efficiency thereby saving energy and offering reduction operating costs compared to tank systems because unlike tanks, if there is no hot water demand, no energy is being used. In addition, we intend to improve manufacturing and life-cycle costs with an improved design conceived not only to increase efficiency, but also the longevity of our products versus competitive units. We have several features and design innovations which are new to the electric tankless water heater market that we believe will give our products a sustainable competitive advantage over our rivals in the market.

Going Concern The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. Management evaluated all relevant conditions and events that are reasonably known or reasonably knowable, in the aggregate, as of the date the consolidated financial statements are issued and determined that substantial doubt exists about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company s ability to generate revenues and raise capital. The Company has not generated sufficient revenues from product sales to provide sufficient cash flows to enable the Company to finance its operations internally. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 34,719 cash on hand. On September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of 71,574,778. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a net loss of 4,908,865, and cash used in operations of 1,668,634. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date of filing. Over the next twelve months management plans to raise additional capital and to invest its working capital resources in sales and marketing in order to increase the distribution and demand for its products. However, there is no guarantee the Company will generate sufficient revenues or raise capital to continue operations. If the Company fails to generate sufficient revenue and obtain additional capital to continue at its expected level of operations, the Company may be forced to scale back or discontinue its sales and marketing efforts. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. Liquidity and Capital Resources At September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 71,574,778. Primarily because of our history of operating losses and our recording of note payables, we have a working capital deficiency of 4,483,190 at September 30, 2024. Losses have been funded primarily through issuance of common stock and borrowings from our stockholders and third-party debt. As of September 30, 2024, we had 34,719 in cash, 83,046 in accounts receivable, and 84,036 in inventory. We used net cash in operating activities of 1,668,634 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Cash Flows from Operating, Investing and Financing Activities The following table provides detailed information about our net cash flow for all financial statement periods presented in this Quarterly Report. To date, we have financed our operations through the issuance of stock and borrowings. 25 Table of Contents The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: Nine months ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Net cash used in operating activities (1,668,634 (1,243,739 Net cash used in investing activities - - Net cash provided by financing activities 1,681,900 1,238,900 Net increase/(decrease) in cash 13,266 (4,839 Cash, beginning 21,453 84,034 Cash, ending 34,719 79,195 Operating activities - Net cash used in operating activities was 1668,634 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1,243,739 used in operating activities for the same period in 2023. The decrease in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to an increase in operating expenses gearing up for production. Financing activities - Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1,681,900 as compared to 1,238,900 for the same period of 2023. The increase of net cash provided by financing activities was mainly attributable to increased equity and debt financing. Ongoing Funding Requirements As of September 30, 2024, we continue to use traditional and/or debt financing to provide the capital we need to run the business. It is possible that we may need additional funding to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditures requirements. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we intend to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. There can be no assurance that any of those sources of funding will be available when needed on acceptable terms or at all. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of existing stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or relationships with third parties when needed or on acceptable terms, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts; abandon our business strategy of growth through acquisitions; or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Future events, however, may differ markedly from our current expectations and assumptions. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies as compared to the critical accounting policies and significant judgements and estimates disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on June 26, 2024. 26 Table of Contents Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk This item in not applicable as we are currently considered a smaller reporting company. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the Company s last fiscal quarter, the Company carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s current management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer (Principal Financial and Accounting Officer), who concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are not effective. Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Company reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer (Principal Financial and Accounting Officer), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in internal control over financial reporting Management reviews the Company s system of internal control over financial reporting and makes changes to the Company s processes and systems to improve controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that the Company maintains an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, consolidating activities and migrating processes. During the Company s last fiscal quarter, there was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 27 Table of Contents PART II - OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business.

On April 6, 2023, the Company was served a Summons for an Amended Complaint filed in the state of Florida with claims for Strict Liability, Negligence and Breach of Implied Warranty. The complaint, filed by an insurance company, stems from its payments for claims filed by a policy holder on two separate occasions. The first insurance claim payment was due to a leak caused by improper installation in which the contractor failed to meet local codes. The second insurance claim payment followed the contractor s failure to properly repair the improper installation. The complaint states that the contractor failed to follow basic installation guidelines supplied with the product in either incident, resulting in damages. On June 8, 2023, the Court of Duval County, FL entered a default judgement for 38,768. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has not paid any of this balance. Item 1A.
