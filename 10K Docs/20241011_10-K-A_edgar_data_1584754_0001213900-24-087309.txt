EXPLANATORY NOTE 

PART I 

Item 1C. Cybersecurity 

We rely upon internally and externally managed
information technology systems and networks for the collection and storage of sensitive data and business information. We approach cybersecurity
risks with a comprehensive risk management and governance strategy designed to assess, identify, and manage cybersecurity risks to our
business. 

Risk Management and Strategy 

Our cybersecurity program is designed to detect
cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities, protect our information systems from such threats, and ensure the confidentiality, integrity,
and availability of systems and information used, owned, or managed by us. Our focus is on protecting sensitive information, such as the personal
information of our customers and employees, and confidential business information that a competitor or a malicious actor could leverage.
Our cybersecurity program has several components, including the adoption of information security protocols, standards, and guidelines
consistent with industry best practices; engaging third-party service providers to conduct security assessments; performing periodic internal
audits of our cybersecurity protocols. We adhere to the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) SP 800-171 and Cybersecurity
Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) 2.0 frameworks, which provide a set of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity-related
risks. 

We have established policies and processes
for assessing, identifying, and managing material risk from cybersecurity threats and have integrated these processes into our overall
risk management systems and processes. We conduct regular risk assessments to identify cybersecurity threats and assessments in the
event of a material change in our business practices that may affect information systems that are vulnerable to such cybersecurity threats.
These risk assessments include identifying reasonably foreseeable internal and external risks, the likelihood and potential damage that
could result from such risks, and the sufficiency of existing policies, procedures, systems, and safeguards in place to manage such risks.
Following these risk assessments, we implement and maintain reasonable safeguards to minimize identified risks, reasonably address any
identified gaps in existing safeguards, and regularly monitor the effectiveness of our safeguards. 

We have implemented technical solutions designed
to protect our information systems from cybersecurity threats, including firewalls, intrusion prevention and detection systems, antimalware
and endpoint protection functionality, and access and identity controls. We regularly evaluate, monitor, and improve these solutions.
As part of our overall risk management system, we monitor and test our safeguards and train our employees on these safeguards, in collaboration
with human resources, information technology, legal, compliance and ethics, and management. Personnel at all levels and departments are
made aware of our cybersecurity policies through periodic training. Further training is performed on a scheduled basis, covering cybersecurity
topics and overall security hygiene, which reflect current techniques and tactics employees may encounter. 

We have experienced incidents in the past
and may experience them in the future. However, we have not experienced any cybersecurity incidents that have been determined to affect
us materially, our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. As external events evolve, we will continue to evaluate
and address these conditions as needed in our Business Continuity and Incident Response programs. For additional information regarding
risks from cybersecurity threats, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors General Risks Security breaches and
other disruptions could compromise our proprietary information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation
to suffer. 

Governance 

One of the key functions of our Board of Directors is informed oversight of our risk management process, including risks from cybersecurity
threats. Our Board of Directors is responsible for monitoring and assessing strategic risk exposure, and our executive officers are responsible
for the day-to-day management of the material risks we face. Our Board of Directors administers its cybersecurity risk oversight function
directly as a whole, as well as through the IT Governance Committee. 

Our Vice President of Information Technology
regularly reports to our IT Governance Committee, which oversees our IT strategy, programs and risks, including the cybersecurity practices,
procedures and controls management used to identify, assess and manage our key cybersecurity programs and risks, ensure the protection
of the confidential intellectual property, information and data of the Company and its customers and ensure compliance with applicable
data protection laws and regulations. Our Vice President of Information Technology has relevant experience of more than 25 years in information
technology and cyber and information security, and he oversees our cybersecurity policies and processes, including those described in
 Risk Management and Strategy above. He also holds multiple certifications including Computer Information Systems Security
Professional (CISSP), Certified in Information Systems Management (CISM), Certified in Information Systems Audit (CISA), Certified in
Risk and Information Systems Control (CRISC), and CompTIA Advanced Security Practitioner (CASP+). Our Vice President of Information
Technology monitors and stays informed about prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation efforts through regular communication
and reporting from our IT department, and through the use of technological tools and software and results from third party assessments.
Our Vice President of Information Technology provides quarterly briefings to the IT Governance Committee regarding our company s
cybersecurity risks and activities, including any recent cybersecurity incidents and related responses, cybersecurity systems testing,
and activities of third parties. Our IT Governance Committee provides regular updates to the Board of Directors on such reports.
