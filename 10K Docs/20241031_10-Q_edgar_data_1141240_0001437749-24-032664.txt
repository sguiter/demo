 Overview 
 
 We are a materials technology company that works with manufacturing and commercial partners to develop and commercialize products made from our proprietary amorphous alloys. Our Liquidmetal family of alloys consists of a variety of proprietary bulk alloys and composites that utilize the advantages offered by amorphous alloy technology. We work with partners to design, develop, and sell custom products and parts from bulk amorphous alloys for sale in various industries. We also partner with third-party manufacturers and licensees to develop and commercialize Liquidmetal alloy products. 
 
 Amorphous alloys are, in general, unique materials that are distinguished by their ability to retain a random atomic structure when they solidify, in contrast to the crystalline atomic structure that forms in other metals and alloys when they solidify. Liquidmetal alloys are proprietary amorphous alloys that possess a combination of performance, processing, and potential cost advantages that we believe will make them preferable to other materials in a variety of applications. The amorphous atomic structure of bulk alloys enables them to overcome certain performance limitations caused by inherent weaknesses in crystalline atomic structures, thus facilitating performance and processing characteristics superior in many ways to those of their crystalline counterparts. We believe the alloys and the molding technologies we employ can result in components for many applications that exhibit exceptional dimensional control and repeatability that rivals precision machining, excellent corrosion resistance, brilliant surface finish, high strength, high hardness, high elastic limit, alloys that are non-magnetic, and the ability to form complex shapes common to the injection molding of plastics. All of these characteristics are achievable from the molding process, so design engineers often do not have to select specific alloys to achieve one or more of the characteristics as is the case with crystalline materials. We believe these advantages could result in Liquidmetal alloys supplanting high-performance alloys, such as titanium and stainless steel, and other incumbent materials in a wide variety of applications. Moreover, we believe these advantages could enable the introduction of entirely new products and applications that are not possible or commercially viable with other materials. 
 
 Our bulk amorphous alloy technology is a relatively new technology as compared to many other material technologies, such as plastics and widely-used high-performance crystalline alloys. Historically, the successful commercialization of a new material technology has required the persistent improvement and refining of the technology over a sometimes lengthy period of time. Accordingly, we believe that our Company s future success will be dependent on our ability to continue expanding and improving our technology platform by, among other things, constantly refining and improving our processes, optimizing our existing amorphous alloy compositions for various applications, and developing and improving new bulk amorphous alloy compositions. 
 
 Our revenues are derived from i) selling our bulk amorphous alloy custom products and parts for applications which include, but are not limited to, non-consumer electronic devices, medical products, automotive components, and sports and leisure goods ii) selling tooling and prototype parts such as demonstration parts and test samples for customers with products in development and iii) product licensing and royalty revenue. 
 
 Our cost of sales consists primarily of the costs of manufacturing, which include raw alloy and direct labor costs. Selling, general, and administrative expenses currently consist primarily of salaries and related benefits, travel, consulting and professional fees, depreciation and amortization, insurance, office and administrative expenses, and other expenses related to our operations.

Table of Contents 

Research and development expenses represent salaries, related benefits expenses, consulting and contract services, expenses incurred for the design and testing of new processing methods, expenses for the development of sample and prototype products, and other expenses related to the research and development of Liquidmetal bulk alloys. Costs associated with research and development activities are expensed as incurred. We plan to enhance our competitive position by improving our existing technologies and developing advances in amorphous alloy technologies. We believe that our research and development efforts will focus on the discovery of new alloy compositions, the development of improved processing technology, and the identification of new applications for our alloys.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 
 We believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to our consolidated financial statements since these policies require significant judgment or involve complex estimates that are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results: 

Revenue recognition 

Impairment of long-lived assets and definite-lived intangibles 

Deferred tax assets 

Share based compensation 

Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Annual Report contains further discussions on our critical accounting policies and estimates.

Revenue Total revenue increased to 316 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 127 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was attributable to increase in product shipments primarily related to the launch of health monitoring rings utilizing our technology. 
 
 Cost of sales Cost of sales was 239, or 75.6 of total revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 89, or 70.1 of total revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in our cost of sales was primarily driven by lower product revenues during Q3 2023 compared to Q3 2024. Once we are able to sustain and increase shipments of routine, commercial products and parts through our contract manufacturers, we expect our cost of sales percentages to decrease, stabilize, and be more predictable. 
 
 Gross profit Our gross profit increased by 39 from 38 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 77 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Our gross margin percentage decreased slightly from Q3 2023 to Q3 2024. Our gross profit percentages have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate based on production volumes and quoted production prices per unit and may not be representative of our future business. If we are able to sustain and increase shipments of routine, commercial products and parts through future orders to third party contract manufacturers, we expect our gross profit percentages to stabilize, increase, and be more predictable. 
 
 Selling, marketing, general and administrative Selling, marketing, general, and administrative expenses increased by 157 to 903, or 285.8 of revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 746, or 587.4 of revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in operating expenses year over year.

Table of Contents 

Research and development Research and development expenses stayed similar in Q3 2024 compared to Q3 2023. Going forward, we will continue to perform research and development of new Liquidmetal alloys and related processing capabilities, albeit on a reduced basis. We continue to invest in our technology infrastructure to expedite the adoption of our technology, but we have experienced long sales lead times for customer adoption of our technology. Until that time when we can either (i) increase our revenues with shipments of routine, commercial products and parts through third party contract manufacturers or (ii) obtain significant licensing revenues, we expect to continue to have operating losses for the foreseeable future. 
 
 Interest and Investment Income Interest and investment income relates to interest earned from our cash deposits and investments in debt securities for the respective periods. Interest and investment income was 258 and 157 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily due to higher overall yields on debt securities as a result of interest rate increases by the government in Q3 2024 compared to Q3 2023. 
 
 Lease income Lease income relates to straight-line rental income received under the Facility Lease. Such amounts were 89 and 89 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Other income Other income relates to employee retention tax credits for the three months ended September 30, 2024. We did not have any in the prior year in the same period.

 Interest and Investment Income Interest and investment income relates to interest earned from our cash deposits and investments in debt securities for the respective periods. Interest and investment income was 775 and 400 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily due to higher overall yields on debt securities as a result of higher overall interest rates by the government during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to same comparative period in the prior year. 
 
 Lease income Lease income relates to straight-line rental income received under the Facility Lease. Such amounts were 267 and 296 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Other income Other income relates to collections from previously written off accounts receivables that were deemed uncollectable and employee retention tax credits for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We did not have any in the prior year in the same period. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Cash used in operating activities 
 
 Cash used in operating activities totaled 619 135 and 1,200 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The cash was primarily used to fund operating expenses related to our business and product development efforts. 
 
 Cash provided by (used in) investing activities 
 
 Cash provided by (used in) investing activities totaled 3,812) and 8,414, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Investing inflows primarily consist of proceeds from the sale of debt securities. Investing outflows primarily consist of purchases of debt securities. 
 
 Cash provided by financing activities 
 
 The Company did not have any financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Financing arrangements and outlook 
 
 We have a relatively limited history of selling bulk amorphous alloy products and components on a mass-production scale. Furthermore, the ability of future contract manufacturers to produce our products in desired quantities and at commercially reasonable prices is uncertain and is dependent on a variety of factors that are outside of our control, including the nature and design of the component, the customer s specifications, and required delivery timelines. These factors have previously required that we engage in equity sales under various stock purchase agreements to support its operations and strategic initiatives. 
 
 However, as of September 30, 2024, we had 4,895 in cash and restricted cash, as well as 18,064 in investments in debt securities. We view this total of 22,959 as readily available sources of liquidity in the event needed to advance our existing strategy, and/or pursue an alternative strategy. As such, we anticipate that our current capital resources, when considering expected losses from operations, will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future.
