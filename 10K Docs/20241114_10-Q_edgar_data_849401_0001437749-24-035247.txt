Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 85,904. The increase is a result of increased sales of 119,547 in the Engineering, an increase of 12,826 in Chemical segment offset by decrease of 46,469 in the Medical segment.. 

Revenues for the six months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 181,060. The increase is a result of increased sales of 88,047 in the Engineering, an increase of 98,534 in Electronics segment offset by decrease of 5,521 in the Chemical segment.. 

Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2023 decreased by 386,136. The decrease is a result of decreased sales of 62,485 in the Chemical segment, 240,979 in the Electronics segment and 82,672 in the Engineering segment. 

Revenues for the six months ended September 30, 2023 decreased by 544,855. The decrease is a result of decreased sales of 96,655 in the Chemical segment, 439,508 in the Electronics segment and 8,692 in the Engineering segment. 

Gross profit for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 212,630 and 408,391, respectively. The increase in gross profit resulted primarily from a net sales increase caused by an increase in sales prices of approximately 10 along with a decrease in cost of sales for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 of 126,726 and 277,331, respectively. 

Gross profit for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 decreased by 351,881 and 409,798, respectively. The decrease in gross profit resulted primarily from decreased sales in all segments, Chemical, Electronics and Engineering. 

We are highly dependent upon certain customers. During the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, two customers accounted for 50 and 45 of our net revenue, respectively. Net revenues from foreign customers for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 was 95,900 or 11 and 214,181 or 13 , respectively. 

Net revenues from foreign customers for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 were 79,106 or 10 of net sales and 198,141 or 13 of net sales, respectively. 

Income / (loss) from operations for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 was (52,187) and 220,481, respectively, compared to loss from operations for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 was (228,105) and (360,366), respectively. 

Other income increased / (decreased) (455) and 96,978 for the three and six months ended September 30, 202, respectively.. The increase is mainly attributable to an increase in interest income and an increase in unrealized investment gain. 

The foregoing resulted in net profit / (loss) before provision for taxes for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 of (52,256) and 220,412, respectively and (228,105) and (360,366) before provision for taxes for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

At September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 427,777 as compared to 537,041 at March 31, 2024.

Future Sources of Liquidity: 

We expect that growth with profitable customers and continued focus on new customers will enable us to generate cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2025. 

Based on current expectations, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents of 427,777 as of September 30, 2024, and other potential sources of cash will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements. Our ability to meet these requirements will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. 

OPERATING ACTIVITIES 

Net cash used by operating activities was (437,911) for the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net cash used by operating activities of (455,621) for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The cash used during the six months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a net income of 219,412, a decrease in net operating assets of 565,838, coupled by a decrease in net operating liabilities of 87,307, write-off of inventories of 49,214, amortization of 3,856, and stock based compensation of 2,064, and non-cash interest expense of 9,576. 

INVESTING ACTIVITIES 

Investing activities consist of various equity investments that resulted in net cash provided by investing activities of 338,500 for the six months ended September 30, 2024 

FINANCING ACTIVITIES 

For the six months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used by financing activities was 9,853 due to net borrowing and payments in the line of credit of (7,163) coupled repayments on the PPP loan of (2,690). 

OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Concentration of Credit Risk 

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. 

Cash and cash equivalents For financial statement purposes, the Company considers as cash equivalents all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at inception. The Company deposits cash and cash equivalents with high credit quality financial institutions and believes that any amounts in excess of insurance limitations to be at minimal risk. Cash and cash equivalents held at these accounts are currently insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC up to a maximum of 250,000. At September 30, 2024, approximately 287,000 exceeded the FDIC limit. 

Our sales are materially dependent on a small group of customers, as noted in Note 6 of our condensed consolidated financial statements. We monitor our credit risk associated with our receivables on a routine basis. We also maintain credit controls for evaluating and granting customer credit.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

The Company's management, including the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's "disclosure controls and procedures," as such term is defined in Ru1e 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the "Exchange Act"). Based upon their evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective for the purpose of ensuring that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") (1) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and (2) is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. During the quarterly and year to date period ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting which materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal controls over financial reporting. 

The determination that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024, is a result of: 

a. Deficiencies in Internal Control Structure Environment. During the current year, the Company s focus was on expanding their customer base to initiate revenue production. 

b. Inadequate staffing and supervision within the accounting operations of our company. The relatively small number of employees who are responsible for accounting functions prevents the Company from segregating duties within its internal control system. The inadequate segregation of duties is a weakness because it could lead to the untimely identification and resolution of accounting and disclosure matters or could lead to a failure to perform timely and effective reviews. The Company s plan is to expand its accounting operations as the business of the Company expands. 

The Company believes that the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024, and March 31, 2024 and the related condensed consolidated statements of operations, and cash flows for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, notwithstanding the material weaknesses we identified. 

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
