 Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are made in reliance on the safe harbor protections provided thereunder. Forward looking statements can be identified by words such as could, may, might, will, likely, anticipates, intends, plans, seeks, believes, estimates, expects, continues, projects or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. In particular, statements about the markets in which we operate, including competition, growth and trends in our markets and industry; our strategies, outcomes and prospects; our expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions; and future events or performance made in the sections titled Risk Factors , Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Notes to Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) are forward-looking statements. 
 Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, by their nature, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. As a result, the Company s actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements include: 
 the impact on both the supply and demand for our products caused by general economic conditions, such as the macroeconomic pressures in Canada and/or the U.S., and changes in consumer confidence and spending; 
 our ability to anticipate consumer demand and to source and process a sufficient quantity of quality secondhand items at attractive prices on a recurring basis; 
 risks related to attracting new, and retaining existing customers, including by increasing acceptance of secondhand items among new and growing customer demographics; 
 risks associated with our status as a brick and mortar only retailer and our lack of operations in the growing online retail marketplace; 
 our failure to open new profitable stores or successfully enter new markets on a timely basis or at all; 
 risks associated with doing business with international manufacturers and suppliers including, but not limited to, transportation and shipping challenges, regulatory risks in foreign jurisdictions (particularly in Canada, where we maintain extensive operations) and exchange rate risks, which we may not be able to fully hedge; 
 the loss of, or disruption or interruption in the operations of, our centralized processing centers; 
 risks associated with litigation, the expense of defense, and the potential for adverse outcomes; 
 our failure to properly hire and to retain key personnel and other qualified personnel or to manage labor costs; 
 risks associated with the timely and effective deployment, protection, and defense of our computer networks and other electronic systems, including e-mail; 
 changes in government regulations, procedures and requirements; 
 our ability to maintain an effective system of internal controls and produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations; 
 risks associated with heightened geopolitical instability due to the conflicts in the Middle East and Eastern Europe; 
 the outbreak of viruses or widespread illness, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters or other highly disruptive events and regulatory responses thereto; and 
 other factors set forth under the heading Risk Factors in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 8, 2024. 
 These risks are not exhaustive. Other sections of this Quarterly Report include additional factors that could adversely affect our business and financial performance. 
 Any forward-looking statement made by us in this Quarterly Report speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and while we believe that information forms a reasonable basis for such statements, that information may be limited or incomplete, and our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. Moreover, factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We are not under any obligation (and we specifically disclaim any such obligation) to update or alter these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

 million, which is comprised of cash consideration of million, including a holdback of million, and acquisition-related contingent consideration with an initial fair value of million (the 2 Peaches Acquisition ). 2 Peaches is a thrift store chain with locations in the Atlanta, Georgia, metropolitan area. The acquired stores are the Company s first locations in the state of Georgia and will serve as a base for the Company s entrance and expansion into the southeast region of the U.S. 
 The 2 Peaches Acquisition was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Topic 805, Business Combinations, and the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their fair value at the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill, which is deductible for income tax purposes. Under the acquisition method, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company include the operations of 2 Peaches from the acquisition date. Measurement period adjustments to preliminary fair values, with a corresponding offset to goodwill, are permitted up to one year from the acquisition date. 
 Goodwill arising from the acquisition amounted to less than million. Goodwill was allocated to the U.S. Retail reporting unit. The preliminary fair value of assets acquired was million, which primarily comprised million for right-of-use assets, million for a charity licensing agreement, million for inventory, million for property and equipment, and million of cash. The charity licensing agreement will be amortized on a straight-line basis over its remaining useful life, which is expected to be through the end of fiscal 2024. The preliminary fair value of liabilities assumed was million. 
 The acquisition-related contingent consideration arrangement with an initial fair value of million requires us to make a future cash payment of up to million upon achievement of specific milestones; the associated liability is classified in other liabilities in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheets. See Note 5. Fair Value Measurements, for information related to the fair value of the contingent consideration. 
 We have not presented pro forma results of operations including 2 Peaches since their results of operations are not material to our consolidated financial results.

 On January 30, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment (the Third Amendment to its Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Among other things, the Third Amendment (i) removed the SOFR adjustment margin, (ii) reduced the margin on existing borrowings under the Term Loan Facility from a range of to to a range of to , (iii) revised the leverage-based pricing grid applicable to borrowings under the Term Loan Facility such that, among other things, a lower leverage ratio than was previously required is needed to obtain a reduction in margin, (iv) provided for a reduction of the margin applicable to term loan borrowings if the Company achieves certain public corporate family ratings and (v) increased the limit on the customary incremental uncommitted revolving credit facility that does not require consent of the required lenders to the greater of (a) million and (b) of EBITDA for the prior four quarters. The Third Amendment resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of million. 
 On February 9, 2024, the Company achieved the public corporate family ratings required for a reduction of the margin applicable to its term loan borrowings. 
 On March 4, 2024, the Company redeemed million aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes, equal to of the outstanding balance at December 30, 2023. In addition to paying accrued interest, the Company paid a premium of , or million, on the partial redemption. This transaction resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of million . 
 On June 27, 2024, the Company entered into another amendment to its Senior Secured Credit Facilities (the Fourth Amendment ). Among other things, the Fourth Amendment (i) increased the maximum amount available under the Revolving Credit Facility by million to million, and (ii) extended the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility from April 26, 2026 to April 26, 2027. 
 As of September 28, 2024, there were advances on the Revolving Credit Facility, there were million of letters of credit outstanding and million was available to borrow.

 Total Liabilities: Forward contracts Acquisition-related contingent consideration Total 
 The following table presents financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 30, 2023: 
 Fair Value Hierarchy (in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Assets: Money market funds Interest rate swaps Cross currency swaps Total Liabilities: Cross currency swaps Forward contracts Total 
 Money market funds consist of short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. Interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and forward contracts are fair valued using independent pricing services and the Company obtains an understanding of the methods used in pricing. As such, these derivative instruments are classified within Level 2. 
 The fair value of the Company s Senior Secured Notes, based on Level 1 inputs, was million and million at September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively. The fair value of borrowings under the Company s Senior Secured Credit Facilities approximate their carrying value as the current rates approximate rates on similar debt and were based on rate notices provided by the Administrative Agent (Level 2 inputs) at September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023. 
 The fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration liability is based on significant unobservable inputs, including management estimates and assumptions, and is measured based on the probability-weighted present value of the potential payment. Accordingly, the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration has been classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.

 million and million, respectively. In April 2024, the Company terminated its cross currency swaps, resulting in net proceeds of million. These cross currency swaps were not designated in hedging relationships. Cross currency swaps with notional amounts of million were outstanding as of December 30, 2023. 
 Interest rate swap contracts 
 The Company s market risk is affected by changes in interest rates. The Company s Senior Secured Credit Facilities bear interest based on market rates plus an applicable margin. Because the interest rate on the Company s floating-rate debt is tied to market rates, the Company may from time to time manage its exposure to interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of its floating-rate debt to fixed-rate debt using interest rate swaps. Interest rate swaps, as used by the Company, involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreement without exchange of the underlying notional amount. The Company previously entered into two interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges. In April 2024, the Company terminated its interest rate swaps, resulting in net proceeds of million. All amounts deferred into other comprehensive loss prior to termination will be amortized to interest expense through May 2025, being the original maturity date of the interest rate swaps. Interest rate swaps with notional amounts of million were outstanding at December 30, 2023.

The share repurchase program does not obligate us to purchase any minimum number of shares, and the program may be suspended, modified, or discontinued at any time without prior notice. The timing, actual number and value of any additional shares purchased will depend on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the market price of the Company s common stock, general business and market conditions, other investment opportunities, and applicable regulatory requirements. 
 We have elected to retire shares repurchased to date and record the excess of cost over par value as an increase in accumulated deficit.

 In the normal course of business, the Company is required to make estimated tax payments throughout the year based on the expected tax liability for the full year. This results in a prepaid balance during the first half of the year, as the Company earns most of its profit in the second half of the year. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had a million balance in prepaid income taxes, which is classified in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheets.

 Overview 
 We are the largest for-profit thrift operator in the United States U.S. and Canada and operate a total of 344 s tores under the Savers , Value Village , Value Village Boutique , Village des Valeurs , Unique , and 2nd Ave. banners. We are committed to redefining secondhand shopping by providing one-of-a-kind, low-priced merchandise ranging from quality clothing to home goods in an exciting treasure-hunt shopping environment. We purchase secondhand textiles (e.g., clothing, bedding and bath items), shoes, accessories, housewares, books and other goods from our non-profit partners NPPs either directly from them or via on-site donations OSDs at Community Donation Centers CDCs at our stores as well as through GreenDrop s mobile donation stations. We then process, select, price, merchandise and sell these items in our stores. Items that are not sold to our retail customers are marketed to wholesale customers, who reuse or repurpose the items they purchase from us. We believe our hyper-local and socially responsible procurement model, industry-leading and innovative operations, differentiated value proposition and deep relationships with our customers distinguish us from other secondhand and value-based retailers . Our business model is rooted in ESG principles, with a mission to positively impact our stakeholders: thrifters, NPPs and their donors, our team members and our stockholders. As a leader and pioneer of the for-profit thrift category, we seek to positively impact the environment by reducing waste and extending the life of reusable goods. The vast majority of the clothing and textiles we source are sold to our retail or wholesale customers. 
 We offer a dynamic, ever-changing selection of items, with an average unit retail AUR price of approximately 5. Our most engaged customers are members of our Super Savers Club loyalty program. As of September 28, 2024, we had 5.8 million total active members enrolled in our U.S. and Canadian loyalty programs each of whom have made a purchase within the last 12 months, compared to 5.2 million total active members as of September 30, 2023. Active members drove 71.9 of point-of-sale transaction value during the twelve months ended September 28, 2024, compared to 69.9 of point-of-sale transaction value during the twelve months ended September 30, 2023. 
 We have innovated and invested in the development of significant operational expertise in order to integrate the three highly-complex parts of thrift operations supply and processing, retail, and sales to wholesale markets. Our business model enables us to provide value to our NPPs and our customers, while driving attractive profitability and cash flow. 
 While purchases made by our customers in our stores do not directly benefit any NPP, we pay our NPPs a contracted rate for all donations. Our subsidiaries are registered professional fundraisers where required. 
 We source our merchandise locally by purchasing secondhand items donated to our NPPs primarily through three distinct and strategic procurement models: 
 OSDs: donations of items by individuals to our local NPPs made at CDCs located at our stores; 
 GreenDrop locations: mobile donation stations placed in convenient, attractive and high-traffic locations that offer a fast and friendly experience to donors in the communities surrounding our stores; and 
 delivered supply: items donated to and collected by our NPPs through a variety of methods, such as neighborhood collections and donation drives. 
 We purchase merchandise from our NPPs which provides them with revenue to support their community-focused missions. From 2018 to 2023, over 90 of our supply was locally sourced, delivering a broad and diverse selection to our customers and fostering a sense of community. Our stores deliver a broad selection for our customers and at the same time reduce transportation costs and emissions typically associated with the production and distribution of new merchandise. 
 Our continued investment in our stores has both elevated and modernized the thrift shopping experience, transforming our stores into a thrift destination for all generations with increasing traffic from younger generations. To maximize traffic, we leverage data to drive merchandising decisions. For each store, we closely track what is being sold to inform how we optimize our merchandising mix, including by leveraging data analytics. We have also implemented self-checkout kiosks to significantly enhance store efficiency and shorten lines, thereby further improving the shopping experience. 
 We display approximately 50 of all textile items we receive on our retail sales floors, approximately 50 of which are sold to thrifters. In support of our efforts to extend the life of reusable goods and recover a portion of the cost of acquiring our supply of secondhand items, we sell the majority of textiles, shoes and books unsold at retail to our wholesale customers (predominantly comprised of textile graders and small business owners) who supply local communities across the globe with gently used, affordable items like clothing, housewares, toys and shoes. Textiles not suitable for reuse as secondhand clothing can be repurposed into other textile items (e.g., wiping rags) and post-consumer fibers (e.g., insulation, carpet padding), further reducing waste.

 Recent Developments 
 Macroeconomic Conditions in Canada 
 The macroeconomic environment in Canada remains challenging, with elevated levels of unemployment and a high cost of living that is especially hard on low-income consumers. In periods of perceived or actual unfavorable economic conditions, consumers may reallocate their discretionary spending, which may adversely impact demand for the Company products and our profitability. 
 In response to the macroeconomic pressures in Canada, we have been actively testing different approaches to improve our Canadian business, particularly in the areas of selection and pricing, to drive foot traffic, increase conversion and improve our overall value perception among consumers at existing stores. 
 2 Peaches Acquisition 
 On May 6, 2024, the Company acquired all of the equity of 2 Peaches Group, LLC 2 Peaches for 5.4 million, which is comprised of cash consideration of 3.5 million, including a holdback of 0.5 million, and acquisition-related contingent consideration with an initial fair value of 1.9 million (the 2 Peaches Acquisition ). 2 Peaches is a thrift store chain with seven locations in the Atlanta, Georgia, metropolitan area. The acquired stores are the Company s first locations in the state of Georgia and will serve as a base for the Company s entrance and expansion into the southeast region of the U.S. Goodwill arising from the acquisition amounted to less than 0.1 million. 
 
 Derivative Financial Instruments 
 In April 2024, we terminated our interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps realizing net proceeds of 38.4 million. 
 Revolver Upsizing 
 On June 27, 2024, the Company entered into a fourth amendment to its Senior Secured Credit Facilities that, among other things, increased the maximum amount available under the Revolving Credit Facility by 50.0 million to 125.0 million, and extended the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility from April 26, 2026 to April 26, 2027. 
 Share Repurchases

 Key Performance Indicators 
 We use the key performance indicators below to evaluate the performance of our business, identify trends, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions. We believe these metrics provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management team. 
 The following table summarizes our key performance indicators for the periods indicated: 
 Thirteen Weeks Ended Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Comparable Store Sales (1) 
 United States 1.6 3.3 2.0 4.8 Canada (7.5) 4.3 (4.5) 6.1 Total (2) 
 (2.4) 3.7 (0.7) 5.4 Number of Stores United States 167 152 167 152 Canada 164 157 164 157 Total (2) 
 344 321 344 321 Other Metrics 
 Pounds processed (lbs mm) 261 249 753 734 Sales yield (3) 
 1.45 1.50 1.44 1.46 Cost of merchandise sold per pound processed 0.65 0.64 0.65 0.63 
 (1) Comparable store sales is the percentage change in comparable store sales over the comparable period in the prior fiscal year. We define comparable store sales to be sales by stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years, or, in other words, stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation. In fiscal year 2024, comparable store sales excludes stores acquired in the 2 Peaches Acquisition. In fiscal year 2023, comparable store sales excludes stores acquired in the 2nd Ave. acquisition because those stores were not yet fully integrated during the prior year comparative period. Comparable store sales is measured in local currency for Canada, while total comparable store sales is measured on a constant currency basis. 
 (2) Total comparable store sales and total number of stores include our Australia retail locations, in addition to retail stores in the U.S. and Canada. 
 (3) We define sales yield as retail sales generated per pound processed on a currency neutral and comparable store basis. 
 Comparable store sales 
 Comparable store sales provides us with visibility into top-line performance on a like-for-like basis excluding new stores opened in the current or previous reporting period and excluding all closed stores as of the end of the current reporting period. We believe investors can use this metric to assess our ability to increase comparable store sales over time. 
 D uring the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024, our comparable store sales declined 2.4 , primarily reflecting a decrease in transactions in our Canada Retail segment, partially offset by higher transactions and average basket in our U.S. Retail segment. During the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023, our comparable store sales increased 3.7 , primarily reflecting growth in transactions. 
 During the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, our comparable store sales declined 0.7 , primarily reflecting a decrease in transactions in our Canada Retail segment, partially offset by higher transactions and average basket in our U.S. Retail segment. During the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023, our comparable store sales increased 5.4 , primarily reflecting growth in transactions.

 Number of stores 
 Our number of stores provides us visibility into the scale of our operations and is viewed as a key driver of long-term growth. We believe investors can use this metric to assess our ability to open new stores, especially in in high-growth markets. 
 Our number of stores increased to 344 stores as of September 28, 2024, from 321 stores as of September 30, 2023. The increase in stores resulted from the opening of eight net new stores in the U.S., seven net new stores in Canada and one new store in Australia, as well as the addition of seven stores through the 2 Peaches Acquisition. 
 Pounds processed 
 We define pounds processed as the total number of pounds of goods processed during the period, excluding furniture and other large items. We process inventory by receiving goods directly from our NPPs or through OSDs and GreenDrop, sorting them, and placing them on the sales floor . From 2019 to 2023, we have found that items sourced through OSDs have a cost per pound that is on average less than one-third that of delivered supply from our NPPs. This metric is an indicator of the amount of secondhand goods processed during the period and is typically a key driver of top-line sales growth. We believe investors can use this metric to assist in their evaluation of our sales growth and sales yield. 
 During the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024 , we processed 261 million pounds of supply, of which 79.8 was comprised of supply from OSDs and GreenDrop. During the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023, we processed 249 million pounds of supply, of which 77.9 was comprised of supply from OSDs and GreenDrop. 
 During the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 , we processed 753 million pounds of supply, of which 76.8 was comprised of supply from OSDs and GreenDrop. During the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023, we processed 734 million pounds of supply, of which 74.4 was comprised of supply from OSDs and G reenDrop. 
 Sales yield 
 We define sales yield as retail sales generated per pound processed on a currency neutral and comparable store basis. We believe investors can use this metric as an indicator of the quality of goods we source, because when the quality is high, we are able to sell more items and/or sell items at higher prices from the volume we process than we would otherwise. 
 Our sales yield for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024 was 1.45, compared to 1.50 for the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023. The 3.3 decline in sales yield primarily reflects a decrease in items sold per pound processed in Canada and the U.S., partially offset by higher price points on items sold in the U.S. 
 Our sales yield for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 was 1.44, compared to 1.46 for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023. The 1.4 decline in sales yield primarily reflects a decrease in items sold per pound processed in Canada. 
 Cost of merchandise sold per pound processed 
 We define cost of merchandise sold per pound processed as cost of merchandise sold, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, on a reported basis, divided by total pounds of goods processed. We believe investors can use this metric to determine our ability to cost-effectively purchase and process supply items, and determine the value of incremental sales. 
 Cost of merchandise sold per pound processed during the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024 was 0.65, compared to 0.64 for the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023. 
 Cost of merchandise sold per pound processed during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 was 0.65, compared to 0.63 for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023.

 Cost of merchandise sold, exclusive of depreciation and amortization 
 The following table presents cost of merchandise sold, exclusive of depreciation and amortization cost of merchandise sold ): 
 Thirteen Weeks Ended (in thousands) September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Change Change Cost of merchandise sold, exclusive of depreciation and amortization 170,776 158,252 12,524 7.9 
 Cost of merchandise sold increased by 12.5 million, or 7.9 , during the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023. 
 Cost of merchandise sold increased 300 basis points to 43.3 of net sales during the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024 . The 300 basis point increase primarily reflects deleverage of cost of merchandise sold as a percentage of net sales on comparable store sales and the impact of new stores. 
 Personnel costs classified within cost of merchandise sold were 99.8 million during the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to 96.4 million during the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of net sales, personnel costs classified within cost of merchandise sold was 25.3 during the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to 24.5 during the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023. The 3.4 million increase in personnel costs resulted primarily from 16 net new stores year-over-year, the opening of new offsite processing facilities and higher wages. 
 Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we have updated the way we define personnel costs classified within cost of merchandise sold and have recast the prior period accordingly. This update had no impact on the total cost of merchandise sold. Specifically, we have updated personnel costs classified within cost of merchandise sold to include offsite processing production labor due to the continued growth of offsite processing. Historically, these costs were included in other costs classified within cost of merchandise sold.

 Personnel costs for our retail and wholesale operations increased by 1.1 million, or 2.3 , during the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023. 
 Personnel costs for our corporate employees decreased by 43.0 million during the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023, primarily reflecting a 39.8 million decrease in IPO-related stock-based compensation expense. The remaining 3.2 million decrease primarily reflects a reduction to annual incentive plan expense, partially offset by higher non-IPO-related stock-based compensation expense and higher wages.

 SG A increased by 1.8 million, or 2.2 , during the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023. The increase in SG A resulted primarily from a 5.5 million increase in rent and utilities that was driven by growth in our store base and store preopening expenses, partially offset by reduced expenditures on repairs and maintenance and professional services of 1.6 million and 1.5 million, respectively.

 Thirteen Weeks Ended (in thousands) September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Change Change Depreciation and amortization 17,297 15,911 1,386 8.7 
 Depreciation and amortization during the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024 increased by 1.4 million, or 8.7 , compared to the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023. The increase in depreciation and amortization resulted primarily from investments in our store build-outs, Centralized Processing Centers CPCs and Automatic Book Processing systems ABPs ), as well as capital expenditures related to capital maintenance.

 Total interest expense, net decreased 3.2 million, or 17.3 , during the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023. This 3.2 million decrease resulted primarily from a 3.6 million decrease in interest expense, net, which was primarily due to a lower weighted average face value of debt and a decrease in the weighted average interest rate. The weighted average face value of debt decreased 7.8 from 828.7 million during the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023 to 764.2 million during the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024 due to debt repayments. Over the same period, the weighted average interest rate decreased 69 basis points from 10.16 to 9.47 . This decrease was primarily due to the execution of the Third Amendment to our Senior Secured Credit Facilities on January 30, 2024, which lowered the total margin on existing borrowings under the Term Loan Facility by 151 basis points.

During the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024, the USD weakened against CAD resulting in remeasurement gains of 3.6 million arising primarily on USD-denominated debt held by one of our Canadian entities. These gains were partially offset by a 1.2 million loss on derivative instruments used to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. 
 During the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023, the USD strengthened against CAD resulting in remeasurement losses of 7.7 million arising primarily on USD-denominated debt held by one of our Canadian entities, which was largely offset by 7.5 million in gains on derivative instruments that we used to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk.

 During the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024, we recorded income tax expense of 13.8 million on income before income taxes of 35.4 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 38.8 . For the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023, we recorded 6.4 million of income tax expense on loss before income taxes of 9.2 million, resulting in an effective incom e tax rate of (69.4) . 
 We estimate an annual projected effective tax rate for the fiscal year to determine income tax expense or benefit in the interim periods. As such, the increase in our effective income tax rate during the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024 compared to the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023 resulted primarily from an increase in income before income taxes to which the annual effective tax rate is applied.

 U.S. Retail segment profit decreased by 8.5 million, or 16.3 , during the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in segment profit primarily reflects the impact of new stores, including salaries, wages and benefits and store preopening expenses, as well as deleverage of cost of merchandise sold as a percentage of net sales on comparable store sales, partially offset by an increase in net sales. 
 Canada Retail 
 Canada Retail net sales decreased by 11.6 million, or 7.1 , during the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in Canada Retail net sales resulted primarily from a 7.5 decline in comparable store sales and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency, partially offset by the opening of seven net new stores since September 30, 2023. The decline in comparable store sales was primarily driven by a decrease in transactions and was negatively impacted by a timing shift in the Canada Day holiday by approximately 100 basis points during the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024. 
 Canada Retail segment profit decreased by 11.1 million, or 19.6 , during the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023.

 Cost of merchandise sold, exclusive of depreciation and amortization 
 The following table presents cost of merchandise sold , exclusive of depreciation and amortization: 
 Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended (in thousands) September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Change Change Cost of merchandise sold, exclusive of depreciation and amortization 491,566 458,950 32,616 7.1 
 Cost of merchandise sold increased by 32.6 million, or 7.1 , during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023. 
 Cost of merchandise sold increased 220 basis points to 43.3 of net sales during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024. The 220 basis point increase primarily reflects deleverage of cost of merchandise sold as a percentage of net sales on comparable store sales, and the impact of new stores and new offsite processing facilities. 
 Personnel costs classified within cost of merchandise sold were 292.2 million during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to 281.7 million during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of net sales, personnel costs classified within cost of merchandise sold was 25.7 during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to 25.2 during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023. The 10.5 million increase in personnel costs resulted primarily from 16 net new stores year-over-year, the opening of new offsite processing facilities and higher wages. 
 Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we have updated the way we define personnel costs classified within cost of merchandise sold and have recast the prior period accordingly. This update had no impact on the total cost of merchandise sold. Specifically, we have updated personnel costs classified within cost of merchandise sold to include offsite processing production labor due to the continued growth of offsite processing. Historically, these costs were included in other costs classified within cost of merchandise sold. 
 Salaries, wages and benefits

 Salaries, wages and benefits expense decreased by 27.2 million, or 9.9 , during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023. 
 Personnel costs for our retail and wholesale operations increased by 3.7 million, or 2.6 , during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023 . The increase primarily reflects growth in our store base year-over-year, as well as higher wages and benefits, partially offset by a reduction to annual incentive plan expense. 
 Personnel costs for our corporate employees decreased by 31.0 million, or 23.7 . Adjusting for the 24.1 million special one-time bonus and related taxes incurred during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023 in relation to the issuance of our Senior Secured Notes, personnel costs for our corporate employees decreased 6.9 million primarily reflecting a reduction to annual incentive plan expense, partially offset by higher wages.

 SG A increased by 12.7 million, or 5.5 , during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023. The increase in SG A resulted primarily from a 12.6 million increase in rent and utilities driven by growth in our store base and store preopening expenses, and a 3.7 million increase in information technology expenses. These increases were partially offset by reduced expenditures on repairs and maintenance of 4.6 million. 
 Depreciation and amortization

 Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended (in thousands) September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Change Change Depreciation and amortization 52,978 45,088 7,890 17.5 
 Depreciation and amortization during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 increased by 7.9 million, or 17.5 , compared to the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023. The increase in depreciation and amortization resulted primarily from investments in our store build-outs, CPCs and ABPs, as well as capital expenditures related to capital maintenance.

 Total interest expense, net decreased 23.6 million, or 33.3 , during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023. This 23.6 million decrease resulted primarily from a 22.9 million decrease in interest expense, net, which was primarily due to a lower weighted average face value of debt and to a lesser extent, a decrease in the weighted average interest rate. The weighted average face value of debt decreased 21.2 from 986.8 million during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023 to 777.5 million during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 primarily due to the timing of debt issuance and debt repayments. Over the same period, the weighted average interest rate decreased 62 basis points from 10.18 to 9.56 . This decrease was primarily due to the execution of the Third Amendment to our Senior Secured Credit Facilities on January 30, 2024, which lowered the total margin on existing borrowings under the Term Loan Facility by 151 basis points.

 Gain on foreign currency, net 
 The following table presents gain on foreign currency, net:

 n/m not meaningful 
 Gains and losses on foreign currency relate primarily to movements in CAD relative to the USD. During the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 , the USD strengthened against CAD resulting in remeasurement losses of 6.4 million arising primarily on USD-denominated debt held by one of our Canadian entities. These losses were largely offset by a 6.9 million gain on derivative instruments used to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk, substantially all of which arose on cross currency swaps prior to their termination in April 2024. 
 Although the USD strengthened marginally against CAD during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023, remeasurement gains recorded during the twenty-six weeks ended July 1, 2023 more than offset remeasurement losses recorded in the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023. This dynamic reflects the repayments of principal totaling 269.2 million that we made during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023 on our USD-denominated debt held by one of our Canadian entities - which is the primary driver of foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses. We also recorded 2.9 million in gains on derivative instruments that we use to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk.

 During the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 , l oss on extinguishment of debt of 4.1 million comprised 0.7 million associated with the repricing of outstanding borrowings under our Term Loan Facility on January 30, 2024 and 3.4 million associated with the redemption of 49.5 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes on March 4, 2024. 
 During the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023 , the Company used net proceeds from its IPO and net proceeds from issuing 550.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and cash on hand to repay 485.8 million in outstanding borrowings on its Term Loan Facility and 55.0 million aggregate principal amount of its Senior Secured Notes, resulting in a loss on debt extinguishment of 16.6 million.

 Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended (in thousands) September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Change Change Income tax expense 15,567 13,957 1,610 11.5 
 During the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, we recorded income tax expense of 15.6 million on income before income taxes of 46.5 million , resulting in an effective tax rate of 33.5 . During the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023, we recorded 14.0 million of income tax expense on income before income taxes of 23.2 million , resulting in an effective income tax rate of 60.2 . The decrease in our effective income tax rate resulted primarily from a decrease to executive compensation subject to limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) Section 162(m) ), and a decrease in Global Intangible Low Taxed Income, with a corresponding decrease to Foreign Derived Intangible Income deductions and foreign tax credits. Executive compensation deduction limitations under Section 162(m) are imposed on publicly held corporations and therefore did not apply to the Company prior to the completion of its IPO on July 3, 2023.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 The Company reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP. We also present the following non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income p er diluted share, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Constant-currency net sales. In the discussion that follows, we provide definitions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We have provided this non-GAAP financial information, which is not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, as information supplemental and in addition to the financial measures presented in this Quarterly Report that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for, or an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. These non-GAAP financial measures may differ from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly-titled measures used by other companies. 
 Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income per diluted share, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin 
 Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income per diluted share, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures. We have included these non-GAAP financial measures as these are key measures used by our management and our board of directors to evaluate our operating performance and the effectiveness of our business strategies, make budgeting decisions, and evaluate compensation decisions. They also best allow comparison of the performance of one period with that of another period. 
 Adjus ted net income is d efined as net income (loss) excluding the impact of loss on extinguishment of debt, IPO-related stock-based compensation expense, transaction costs, dividend-related bonus, (gain) loss on foreign currency, net , executive transition costs, certain other adjustments, the tax effect on the above adjustments, and the excess tax shortfall (benefit) from stock-based compensation . We define Adjusted net income per diluted share as Adjusted net income divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) excluding the impact of interest expense, net, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, loss on extinguishment of debt, stock-based compensation expense, non-cash occupancy-related costs, lease intangible asset expense, pre-opening expenses, store closing expenses, executive transition costs, transaction costs, dividend-related bonus, (gain) loss on foreign currency, net, and certain other adjustments. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales, expressed as a percentage.

 Constant Currency 
 The Company reports certain operating results on a constant-currency basis in order to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of its results without regard to the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. The term foreign currency exchange rates refers to the exchange rates used to translate the Company's operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar into U.S. Dollars. Because the Company is a global company, foreign currency exchange rates used for translation may have a significant effect on its reported results. In general, given the Company's significant operations in Canada, the Company's financial results are affected positively by a weakening of the U.S. Dollar against the Canadian Dollar and are affected negatively by a strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Canadian Dollar. References to operating results on a constant-currency basis mean operating results without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. 
 The Company believes disclosure of constant-currency net sales is helpful to investors because it facilitates period-to-period comparisons of its results by increasing the transparency of its underlying performance by excluding the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. 
 Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. During the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024, as compared to the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023, the U.S. Dollar was stronger relative to the Canadian Dollar but weaker relative to the Australian Dollar, which overall resulted in an unfavorable impact on our operating results. During the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, as compared to the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023, the U.S. Dollar was stronger relative to both the Canadian Dollar and the Australian Dollar, which resulted in an unfavorable foreign currency impact on our operating results. 
 The Company calculates constant-currency net sales by translating current-period net sales using the average exchange rates from the comparative prior period rather than the actual average exchange rates in effect. 
 A reconciliation of GAAP net sales to constant-currency net sales is presented in the table below:

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 We have historically financed our operations primarily with cash generated by operating activities and proceeds from debt issuances. We funded the dividend payment of 262.2 million during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023 with the issuance of debt. Although we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, any future determination relating to dividend policy will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on a number of factors, including restrictions in our current and future debt instruments, our future earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, and applicable Delaware law, which provides that dividends are only payable out of surplus or current net profits.

Table of Contents 

 Our primary short-term requirements for liquidity and capital are to meet general working capital needs, fund capital expenditures and to make interest payments on our debt. Our primary long-term liquidity and capital needs relate to repaying the principal balance on our debt and making lease payments on our retail stores and processing facilities. We may also use cash on our balance sheet, cash generated from operations or proceeds from new borrowings, or any combination of these sources of liquidity and capital, to pay for acquisitions, to fund growth initiatives, to pay down debt or to conduct repurchases of our common stock under our share repurchase program, or any combination of the foregoing. Our primary sources of liquidity and capital are cash generated from operations and proceeds from borrowings, including borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 28, 2024, 123.8 million was available to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash provided by our operating activities are sufficient to fund our liquidity needs for the next 12 months. We may supplement our liquidity needs with borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. 
 See Note 4 to our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for details of our indebtedness. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended September 28, 2024 compared to the Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended September 30, 2023 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows: 
 Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended (in thousands) September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 78,443 104,402 Net cash used in investing activities (55,141) (75,428) Net cash used in financing activities (64,145) (16,111) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (1,393) 312 Net change in cash and cash equivalents (42,236) 13,175 
 Net cash provided by operating activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 was 78.4 million, compared to 104.4 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 26.0 million. This 26.0 million decrease is primarily due to an 18.6 million increase in income taxes paid, net and a 7.9 million decrease in operating income. 
 Net cash used in changes in operating assets and liabilities during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 consisted primarily of a 91.3 million change in operating lease liabilities, an 18.8 million change in accrued payroll and related taxes, and a 13.0 million change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The change in operating lease liabilities resulted from lease payments. The change in accrued payroll and related taxes resulted primarily from the annual payment of incentive compensation to our employees. As of December 30, 2023, we had accrued 24.4 million for employee incentive compensation which was paid during the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. As of September 28, 2024, we had accrued 4.2 million for employee incentive compensation, the majority of which we plan to pay during the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. The change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulted primarily from interest payments on the Senior Secured Notes, which are due every February 15 and August 15 through maturity. As of December 30, 2023, we had an interest accrual of 18.1 million on the Senior Secured Notes which was paid on February 15, 2024. As of September 28, 2024, we had accrued 5.3 million which will be paid on February 15, 2025. 
 38 

Table of Contents 

 Net cash used in changes in operating assets and liabilities during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023 consisted primarily of a 84.1 million change in operating lease liabilities, a 14.2 million change in inventory, and a 5.5 million change in accrued payroll and related taxes. The change in operating lease liabilities resulted from lease payments. The change in inventories is primarily due to seasonality and the timing of processing. The change in accrued payroll and related taxes resulted primarily from the payment of incentive compensation to our employees. As of December 31, 2022, we had accrued 25.0 million for employee incentive compensation which was paid during the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. As of September 30, 2023, we had accrued 19.0 million for employee incentive compensation, the majority of which was paid during the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. 
 Net cash used in investing activities 
 Net cas h used in investing activities was 55.1 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 and 75.4 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023 . Expenditure in both periods consisted primarily of investments in our store build-outs, CPCs and ABPs, as well as capital expenditures related to capital maintenance, all of which are reported as purchases of property and equipment. In the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, we also received proceeds of 28.1 million related to the April 2024 termination of the Company s cross currency swaps and made a net payment of 3.2 million related to the 2 Peaches Acquisition. 
 Net cash used in financing activities 
 Net c ash used i n financing activities was 64.1 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 and consisted primarily of 54.0 million of principal payments on our long-term debt and 20.9 million of share repurchases under our share repurchase program, partially offset by proceeds of 11.9 million related to the settlement of an interest rate swap with an other-than-insignificant financing element at inception. 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 16.1 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023 and consisted primarily of 524.9 million of net proceeds from issuance of the Senior Secured Notes and 306.0 million of net proceeds from our IPO, offset by 546.4 million in principal payments on our long-term debt, the payment of 262.2 million in dividends and a net repayment of 42.0 million on our Revolving Credit Facility. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparation of our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and to make various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows will be affected . We believe that the assumptions and estimates, as set forth in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, associated with the impairment assessments of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, income taxes and stock-based compensation have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Acc ordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to fully understanding and evaluating our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 In the normal course of business, we are exposed to various market risks. Our primary market risks are interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt and foreign currency exchange risk associated with our operations in Canada and Australia. We continually monitor these risks, regularly consider which risks need active management and, when appropriate, develop targeted risk management strategies. We may manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates through the use of derivative financial instruments with the objective of reducing potential income statement, cash flow, and market exposures. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Refer to Note 6. Derivative Financial Instruments for additional information.

Table of Contents 

 In April 2024, the Company terminated its interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps realizing net proceeds of 38.4 million . In light of the Company s historical and expected future de-leveraging, the cross currency swaps no longer provided meaningful benefit to the Company s leverage and equity value at risk. The interest rate swaps were opportunistically terminated as the benefit of the swaps will diminish over time as we expect to continue to pay down debt. 
 Interest rate risk 
 Changes in interest rates affect the amount of interest due on our variable rate debt. As of September 28, 2024, we had variable rate borrowings on the Term Loan Facility of 317.3 million and no advances un der our Revolving Credit Facility. We currently use Term SOFR as the reference rate for our variable rate debt and any future increases in Term SOFR will inherently result in an increase in interest expense and cash paid toward interest. 
 We performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our interest expense. A hypothetical 1 percentage point increase in Term SOFR would result in an increase to interest expense of 3.2 million over 12 months based on amounts outstanding and interest rates in effect as of September 28, 2024. 
 To reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, from time to time we enter into interest rate swaps. In the past we have used interest rate swaps to reduce our exposure to increases in interest rates and effectively convert a portion of our floating-rate debt to a fixed-rate basis. Our interest rate swaps were scheduled to mature on May 31, 2025 but were terminated by the Company in April 2024. 
 Foreign currency exchange risk 
 In addition to our U.S. business, we operate in Canada and Australia. Operations conducted entirely in each jurisdiction use that jurisdiction s currency as their functional currency and changes in foreign exchange rates affect the translation of the results of these businesses into U.S. Dollars USD ), the reporting currency of the Company. For the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, approximately 43.6 of our net sales were denominated in a currency other than USD. For the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, a hypothetical 10 strengthening of USD to the Canadian Dollar CAD would decrease our net sales by 46.1 million (and vice versa). A hypothetical 10 change in the relative fair value of USD to the Australian Dollar AUD would not have a material impact on our operations. We will be susceptible to fluctuations in USD compared to CAD and AUD if we do not hedge our exchange rate exposure. As such, we seek to manage the risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through the use of forward contracts or cross currency swaps or both. Forward contracts are maintained on a rolling 12-month basis and in June 2024 we considerably increased our portfolio of such instruments. Our cross currency swaps were scheduled to mature on May 31, 2025 but were terminated by the Company in April 2024. 
 At September 28, 2024, the entire 317.3 million balance on our variable rate borrowings is USD-denominated and is owed by one of our Canadian subsidiaries whose functional currency is CAD. These variable rate borrowings expose the Company to remeasurement risk. For the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 , a hypothetical 10 strengthening of USD to CAD would decrease net income or increase net loss by 28.8 million . For the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 , a hypothetical 10 weakening of USD to CAD would increase net income or decrease net loss by 35.3 million .

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the 1934 Act) as of September 28, 2024 . Based on the evaluation of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 28, 2024 due to certain material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as described below. In light of this fact, our management has performed additional analyses, reconciliations, and other post-closing procedures and has concluded that, notwithstanding the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, the financial statements for the periods covered by and included in this Quarterly Report fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with GAAP. 
 (b) Material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting 
 As a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting in accordance with applicable rules and guidance and to report any material weaknesses in such internal control over financial reporting. Prior to our IPO, we were a private company with limited accounting personnel and other resources with which to address internal control over financial reporting. 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In connection with this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we identified deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting, which in the aggregate, constitute material weaknesses related to (i) the sufficiency of technical accounting and SEC reporting expertise within our accounting and financial reporting function, (ii) the establishment and documentation of clearly defined roles within our finance and accounting functions and (iii) our ability to evidence the design and implementation of effective information technology general controls ITGCs for information systems and applications that are relevant to the preparation of our financial statements. 
 To address these material weaknesses, we have implemented a plan to hire additional qualified personnel and establish more robust processes to support our internal control over financial reporting, including the documentation of clearly defined roles and responsibilities, and the design and implementation of effective ITGCs. To date, we have hired a director of internal audit, a manager of internal audit and a director of SEC reporting. In addition, we have engaged external advisors who are providing financial accounting assistance and are assisting in evaluating the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting. 
 If our steps a re insufficient to successfully remediate the material weaknesses and otherwise establish and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, the reliability of our financial reporting, investor confidence in us, and the value of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. We may not be able to remediate the identified material weaknesses, and additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting may be identified in the future. Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable and timely financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to reasonably detect and prevent fraud. Our failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, to remedy identified material weaknesses or significant deficiencies or to implement required new or improved controls could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of our financial statements or cause us to fail to timely meet our financial and other reporting obligations. 
 (c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Other than the changes intended to remediate the material weaknesses noted above, there was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting, as defined under Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
