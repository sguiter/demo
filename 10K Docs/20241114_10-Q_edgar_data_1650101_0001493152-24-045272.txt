Overview 

Our
Business 

We
(Addentax Group Corp.) are a Nevada holding company with no material operations of our own. We conduct substantially all of our operations
through our operating companies established in the People s Republic of China, or the PRC, primarily Shenzhen Qianhai Yingxi Industrial
Chain Service Co., Ltd. YX ), our wholly owned subsidiary and its subsidiaries. We are not a Chinese operating company.
We are a holding company and do not directly own any substantive business operations in China. Our holding company structure involves
unique risks to investors. Chinese regulatory authorities could disallow our operating structure, which would likely result in a material
change in our operations and/or the value of our common stock, including that it could cause the value of such securities to significantly
decline or become worthless. Our holding company, Addentax Group Corp., is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol of ATXG .
We classify our businesses into three main segments: garment manufacturing, logistics services, and property management and subleasing.
The Company previously engaged in the provision of epidemic prevention supplies, which included manufacturing, distribution and trading
of epidemic prevention supplies. As the COVID-19 pandemic is near an endemic, the Company ceased to operate in this business in the first
quarter of 2023. The remaining assets of this business segment were reclassified into the Corporate and others segment.
The corresponding items of segment information for the earlier periods were restated to reflect the change of the new segment structure.

the context otherwise requires, all references in this annual report to Addentax refer to Addentax Group Corp.,
a holding company, and references to we, us, our, the Registrant ,

WFOE 
refers to Qianhai Yingxi Textile Garments Co., Ltd, a wholly foreign owned enterprise in China, which is indirectly wholly owned

Our
garment manufacturing business consists of sales made principally to wholesaler located in the PRC. We have our own manufacturing facilities,
with sufficient production capacity and skilled workers on production lines to ensure that we meet our high quality control standards
and timely meet the delivery requirements for our customers. We conduct our garment manufacturing operations through five wholly owned
subsidiaries, namely Dongguan Heng Sheng Wei Garments Co., Ltd HSW ), Dongguan Yushang Clothing Co., Ltd YS ),
 Zhuang Hao Jia (Dongguan) Decoration Engineering Co.,Ltd ZHJ ), and Dongguan Aotesi
Garments Co., Ltd., AOT , which are located in the Guangdong province, China. 

Our
logistics business consists of delivery and courier services covering 44 cities in 10 provinces and 2 municipalities in China. Although
we have our own motor vehicles and drivers, we currently outsource some of the business to our contractors. We believe outsourcing allows
us to maximize our capacity and maintain flexibility while reducing capital expenditures and the costs of keeping drivers during slow
seasons. We conduct our logistic operations through two wholly owned subsidiaries, namely Shenzhen Xin Kuai Jie Transportation Co., Ltd XKJ and Shenzhen Yingxi Peng Fa Logistic Co., Ltd PF ), which are located in the Guangdong province, China. 

Our
property management and subleasing business provides shops subleasing and property management services for garment wholesalers and retailers
in the garment market. We currently have an aggregate of 56,238 square meters floor space and provide approximately 1,300 shop space
to clients. We conduct our property management and subleasing operation through a wholly owned subsidiary acquired in September 2023,
namely Dongguan Hongxiang Commercial Co., Ltd., a PRC company HX ), which is located in the Guangdong province, China. 

To
focus on the core businesses of the Group, the Company dissolved one of its subsidiaries, Shenzhen Yingxi Tongda Logistic Co., Ltd, in
April 2024 and received approval from RPC authorities. 

As
at the date of this report, the Company is in the process of dissolving another subsidiary, ZHJ.

Business
Objectives 

Garment

Seasonality
of Business 

Garment
Manufacturing Business 

We
generally receive more purchase orders during our second and third quarters and fewer manufacture orders during May and June. 

Logistics
Services Business 

We
generally receive more delivery orders in our third and fourth quarters and are more vulnerable to shipping delays in the PRC during
Chinese New Year due to traffic and port congestion, border crossing delays and customs clearance issues. 

Property
Management and Subleasing Business 

There
is no significant seasonality in our business. 

Collection

our new customers, we generally require orders placed to be backed by advances or deposits. For our long-term and established customers
with good payment track records, we generally provide payment terms between 30 to 180 days following their acknowledgement of receipt
of goods. 

Logistics
services business 

For

Economic
Uncertainty 

Our
business is dependent on consumer demand for our products and services. We believe that the significant uncertainty in the economy in
China has increased our clients sensitivity to the cost of our products and services. We have experienced continued pricing pressure.
If the economic environment becomes weak, the economic conditions could have a negative impact on our sales growth and operating margins,
cash position and collection of accounts receivable. Additionally, business credit and liquidity have tightened in China. Some of our
suppliers and customers may face credit issues and could experience cash flow problems and other financial hardships. These factors currently
have not had an impact on the timeliness of receivable collections from our customers. We cannot predict at this time how this situation
will develop and whether accounts receivable may need to be allowed for or written off in the coming quarters. 

Despite
the various risks and uncertainties associated with the current economy in China, we believe our core strengths will continue to allow
us to execute our strategy for long-term sustainable growth in revenue, net income and operating cash flow. 

Summary
of Critical Accounting Policies 

We
have identified critical accounting policies that, as a result of judgments, uncertainties, uniqueness and complexities of the underlying
accounting standards and operation involved could result in material changes to our financial position or results of operations under
different conditions or using different assumptions. 

Estimates
and Assumptions 

We
regularly evaluate the accounting estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. In general, management s estimates
are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed
to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management. 

Revenue
Recognition 

Revenue
is generated through sale of goods and delivery services. Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or
services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods
or services. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising
from contracts with customers. The amount of revenue that is recorded reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive
in exchange for those goods and services. The Company applies the following five-step model in order to determine this amount: 

(i) 
 identification
 of the promised goods and services in the contract; 

(ii) 
 determination
 of whether the promised goods and services are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context of the
 contract; 

(iii) 
 measurement
 of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; 

(iv) 
 allocation
 of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and 

(v) 
 recognition
 of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation. 

5 

The
Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled
to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. Once a contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606
at contract inception, the Company reviews the contract to determine which performance obligations the Company must deliver and which
of these performance obligations are distinct. The Company recognizes as revenues the amount of the transaction price that is allocated
to the respective performance obligation when the performance obligation is satisfied or as it is satisfied. Generally, the Company s
performance obligations are transferred to customers at a point in time, typically upon delivery. 

For
all reporting periods, the Company has not disclosed the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for all product and service revenue
contracts with an original expected length of one year or less, which is an optional exemption that is permitted under the adopted rules. 

Leases 

Lessee 

The
Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use ROU assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in
property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. 

ROU
assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease
payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present
value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of the leases do not provide an implicit rate, The Company generally use the incremental
borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement
date. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Lease expense for lease payments
is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 

Lessor

As
a lessor, the Company s leases are classified as operating leases under ASC 842. Leases, in which the Company is the lessor, are
substantially all accounted for as operating leases and the lease components and non-lease components are accounted for separately. Rental
income from operating leases is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Initial direct costs incurred
in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognized on a straight line
basis over the lease term. 

Accounts
receivable, net 

Accounts
receivable, net are stated at the historical carrying amount net of allowance for doubtful accounts. 

Account
receivables are classified as financial assets subsequently measured at amortized cost. Account receivables are recognized when the Company
becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the receivables. They are measured, at initial recognition, at fair value plus transaction
costs, if any and are subsequently measured at amortized cost. The amortized cost is the amount recognized on the receivable initially,
minus principal repayments, plus cumulative amortization (interest) using the effective interest method of any difference between the
initial amount and the maturity amount, adjusted for any loss allowance. 

A
loss allowance for expected credit losses is recognized on account receivables and is updated at each reporting date. The Company determines
the expected credit losses provisions based on ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of
Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ASC 326 using a modified retrospective approach which did not have
a material impact on the opening balance of accumulated deficit. To determine expected credit losses on account receivables, the Company
will consider the historic credit loss experience, adjusted for factors that are specific to the debtors, general economic conditions,
and an assessment of both the current and forecasted direction of conditions at the reporting date, including the time value of money,
where appropriate. 

The
loss allowance is calculated on a collective basis for all trade and other receivables in totality. An impairment gain or loss is recognized
in profit or loss with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of account receivables, through use of a loss allowance account.
The impairment loss is included in operating expenses as a movement in credit loss allowance. 

Receivables
are written off when there is information indicating that the counterparty is in severe financial difficulty and there is no realistic
prospect of recovery, e.g., when the counterparty has been placed under liquidation or has entered into bankruptcy proceedings. Receivables
written off may still be subject to enforcement activities under the Company s recovery procedures, considering legal advice where
appropriate. Any recoveries made are recognized in profit or loss.

Recently
issued accounting pronouncements 

Accounting
for Convertible Instruments: In August 2020, FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s
Own Equity (ASU 2020-06), as part of its overall simplification initiative to reduce costs and complexity of applying accounting standards
while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. Among other changes, the
new guidance removes from GAAP separation models for convertible debt that require the convertible debt to be separated into a debt and
equity component, unless the conversion feature is required to be bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative or the debt is issued
at a substantial premium. As a result, after adopting the guidance, entities will no longer separately present such embedded conversion
features in equity and will instead account for the convertible debt wholly as debt. The new guidance also requires use of the if-converted 
method when calculating the dilutive impact of convertible debt on earnings per share, which is consistent with the Company s current
accounting treatment under the current guidance. The guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted, but only at the beginning of the
fiscal year. 

The
Company reviews new accounting standards as issued. Management has not identified any other new standards that it believes will have
a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

Revenue 

Total
revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was nearly the same as compared with the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Revenue
generated from our garment manufacturing business contributed approximately 0.1 million, or 11.1 , of our total revenue for the three
months ended September 30, 2024. Revenue generated from garment manufacturing business contributed approximately 0.1 million or 6.8 
of our total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The low level of sales was mainly due to factory facilities
renewal and repairs, and the remaining factories cannot provide the same capacity as previously. We estimate the capacity will recover
at the fiscal year ending 2025.

For
our garment manufacturing business, we purchase the majority of our raw materials directly from numerous local fabric and accessories
suppliers. 

Raw
material costs for our garment manufacturing business were approximately 58.8 of our total garment manufacturing business revenue for
the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with 28.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in percentage
was mainly due to increased orders received. 

Labor
costs for our garment manufacturing business was approximately 24.5 of our total garment manufacturing business revenue for the three
months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with 50.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. We maintained a sustainable level
in wages, the decrease in portion of labor cost was mainly due to the increased in revenue.

and other expenses for our garment manufacturing business accounted for approximately 4.8 of our total garment business revenue for
the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with 2.9 of total garment business revenue for the three months ended September
30, 2023. 

For
our logistic business, we outsourced some of the business to our contractors. We relied on a few subcontractors, of which the
subcontracting fees to our largest contractor represented approximately nil and 35.1 of total cost of revenues for our service
segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease was attributed to an increase in usage of
our own logistics as compared to the subcontractor. We have not experienced any disputes with our subcontractors and we believe we
maintain good relationships with our contract logistics services providers. 

Fuel,
toll and other costs for our service business for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 0.5 million as compared
with 0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Fuel, toll and other costs for our service business accounted for approximately
53.0 of our total service revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with 43.3 for the three months ended September
30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to a decrease of usage of subcontractors during the quarter. 

Subcontracting
fees for our service business for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased approximately 100.0 to nil from 0.3 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Subcontracting fees accounted for nil and 28.6 of our total service business revenue
in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of usage of
subcontractors during the quarter. 

9 

For
property management and subleasing business, the cost of revenue was mainly the amortization of operating lease assets for the subleasing
business. The cost of revenue for property management and subleasing business for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 371,019,
approximately 162.3 of our total property management and subleasing business revenue, as compared with 4,610, or 7.9 of the total
property management and subleasing business revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Gross
profit 

Garment
manufacturing business gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 17,679, as compared with 15,767 for the three
months ended September 30, 2023. Gross profit accounted for 11.9 of our total garment manufacturing business revenue for the three months
ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 17.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of gross profit ratio was
mainly due to the increased raw material costs. 

Gross
profit in our logistics services business for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 453,406 and gross margin was
47.0 . Gross profit in our logistics services business for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was approximately 333,667 and gross
margin was 28.1 . The increase of gross profit ratio was mainly because the Company re-allocated the orders received and reduced fuel
cost. 

Gross
loss in our property management and subleasing business for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 142,440. Gross profit was
 53,453 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Gross loss accounted for (62.3) of our total property management and subleasing
business revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 92.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The
decrease of gross profit ratio was mainly because the property management and subleasing business are still in preliminary stage.
