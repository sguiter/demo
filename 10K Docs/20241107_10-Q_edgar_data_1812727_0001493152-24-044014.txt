Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Overview 

Reliance
Global Group, Inc. (the Company operates as a diversified company engaging in business in the insurance market, as well
as other related sectors. Our focus is to grow the Company by pursuing an aggressive acquisition strategy, initially and primarily focused
upon wholesale and retail insurance agencies. 

In
the insurance sector, our management has extensive experience acquiring and managing insurance portfolios in several states, as well
as developing specialized programs targeting niche markets. Our primary strategy is to identify specific risk to reward arbitrage opportunities
and develop these on a national platform, thereby increasing revenues and returns, and then identify and acquire undervalued wholesale
and retail insurance agencies with operations in growing or underserved segments, expand and optimize their operations, and achieve asset
value appreciation while generating interim cash flows. 

As
part of our growth and acquisition strategy, we continue to survey the current insurance market for value-add acquisition opportunities.
As of September 30, 2024, we had acquired nine insurance agencies. 

Over
the next 12 months, we plan to focus on the expansion and growth of our business through continued asset acquisitions in insurance markets
and organic growth of our current insurance operations through geographic expansion and market share growth. To that end, on May 14,
2024, the Company entered into a Stock Exchange Agreement (the Stock Exchange Agreement to acquire Spetner Associates Spetner ), a well-established benefits enrollment company that, through its BenManage benefits enrollment company, is a
leading provider of voluntary benefits to over 75,000 employees throughout the United States. Pursuant to the Stock Exchange Agreement,
the Company agreed to: (i) acquire 80 of Spetner s issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value 1.00 per share (the
 Spetner Common Stock for 13,714,286 (which amount was to be paid as 5,500,000 in cash, the issuance of certain shares
of the Company s common stock, and the Company s issuance of a promissory note); and (ii) have the sole option to acquire
the remaining 20 of the Spetner Common Stock for a predetermined amount based on a multiple of EBITDA 

Further,
we launched our 5MinuteInsure.com 5MI Insurtech platform during 2021, which expanded our national footprint. 5MI is a
high-tech proprietary tool developed by us as a business to consumer portal which enables consumers to instantly compare quotes from
multiple carriers and purchase their car and home insurance in a time efficient and effective manner. 5MI taps into the growing number
of online shoppers and utilizes advanced artificial intelligence and data mining techniques, to provide competitive insurance quotes
in around 5 minutes with minimal data input needed from the consumer. The platform currently operates
in 46 states offering coverage with up to 30 highly rated insurance carriers. 

With
the acquisition of Barra, we launched RELI Exchange, our business-to-business B2B InsurTech platform and agency partner
network that builds on the artificial intelligence and data mining backbone of 5MinuteInsure.com. Through RELI Exchange we on-board agency
partners and provide them with an InsurTech platform white labeled, designed and branded specifically for their business. This combines
the best of digital and human capabilities by providing our agency partners and their customers quotes from multiple carriers within
minutes. Since its inception, RELI Exchange has increased its agent roster by more than 130 . 

Business
Operations 

We ve
adopted a OneFirm strategy, pursuant to which Company owned and operated agencies come together to operate as one cohesive
unit, which allows for efficient and effective cross-selling, cross-collaboration, and the effective deployment of the Company s
human capital. This strategy also aims to enhance the Company s overall market presence across the U.S., with all business lines
operating under the RELI Exchange brand. It s expected to benefit agents and clients by improving relationships with carriers,
leading to better commission and bonus contracts due to higher business volumes. The approach also strengthens the capability of RELI
Exchange agency partners in securing diverse insurance policies and fosters increased cross-selling opportunities. This unified strategy
positions the Company for rapid scaling and integration of accretive acquisitions, expanding its industry reach. 

20 

Business
Trends and Uncertainties 

The
insurance intermediary business is highly competitive, and we actively compete with numerous firms for customers and insurance companies,
many of which have relationships with insurance companies, or have a significant presence in niche insurance markets that may give them
an advantage over us. Other competitive concerns may include the quality of our products and services, our pricing and the ability of
some of our customers to self-insure and the entrance of technology companies into the insurance intermediary business. Several insurance
companies are engaged in the direct sale of insurance, primarily to individuals, and do not pay commissions to agents and brokers. 

Financial
Instruments 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s financial
instruments consisted of derivative warrants. These were accounted for at fair value as of inception/issuance date, and at fair value
as of each subsequent balance sheet date. Any change in fair value was recorded as non-operating, (non-cash) gain or loss. As of June
18, 2024, the majority of the derivative warrants were exercised and as of September 30, 2024 only a nominal immaterial amount remain
outstanding. 

Insurance
Operations 

Our
insurance operations focus on the acquisition and management of insurance agencies throughout the U.S. Our primary focus is to pinpoint
undervalued wholesale and retail insurance agencies with operations in growing or underserved segments (including healthcare and Medicare,
as well as personal and commercial insurance lines). We then focus on expanding their operations on a national platform and improving
operational efficiencies to achieve asset value appreciation while generating interim cash flows. In the insurance sector, our management
team has over 100 years of experience acquiring and managing insurance portfolios in several states, as well as developing specialized
programs targeting niche markets. We plan to accomplish these objectives by acquiring wholesale and retail insurance agencies it deems
to represent a good buying opportunity (as opposed to insurance carriers) as insurance agencies bear no insurance risk. Once acquired,
we plan to develop them on a national platform to increase revenues and profits through a synergetic structure. The Company is initially
focused on segments that are underserved or growing, including healthcare and Medicare, as well as personal and commercial insurance
lines. 

Insurance
Acquisitions and Strategic Activities 

As
of September 30, 2024, we have acquired multiple insurance brokerages (see table below). As our acquisition strategy continues, our
reach within the insurance arena can provide us with the ability to offer lower rates, which could boost our competitive position within
the industry. In furtherance of this strategy, on May 14, 2024, the Company entered into a Stock Exchange Agreement to acquire Spetner
Associates Spetner for cash, stock and issuance of a promissory note. Spetner is a well-established benefits enrollment
company that, through its BenManage benefits enrollment company, is a leading provider of voluntary benefits to over 75,000 employees
throughout the United States. Completion of the transaction is subject to standard and stipulated closing.

Reverse
Stock Split 

On
July 1, 2024, the Company effectuated a 1-for-17 reverse stock split of the Company s issued and outstanding common stock (the
 Reverse Split-2024 ). The par value remained unchanged. All share and per share information, as well as common stock and
additional paid-in capital, have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Reverse Split-2024 for all periods presented, unless otherwise
indicated. The Reverse Split-2024 resulted in a rounding addition of approximately 110,350 shares valued at par, totaling 9,490 for
which shares were issued in July 2024.

Non-GAAP
Measure 

The
Company believes certain financial measures which meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures, as defined in Regulation G of the
SEC rules, provide important supplemental information. Adjusted EBITDA AEBITDA ), our key financial performance metric,
is a non-GAAP financial measure that is not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States of America GAAP ). AEBITDA is defined as earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) with additional adjustments as further outlined below. The Company considers
AEBITDA an important financial metric because it provides a meaningful financial measure of the quality of the Company s operational,
cash impacted and recurring earnings and operating performance across reporting periods. Other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA
differently than we do, which might limit its usefulness as a comparative measure to other companies in the industry. AEBITDA is used
by management in addition to and in conjunction (and not as a substitute) with the results presented in accordance with GAAP. Management
uses AEBITDA to evaluate the Company s operational performance, including earnings across reporting periods and the merits for
implementing cost-cutting measures. We have presented AEBITDA solely as supplemental disclosure because we believe it allows for a more
complete analysis of results of operations and assists investors and analysts in comparing our operating performance across reporting
periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Consistent
with Regulation G, a description of such information is provided below herein and tabular reconciliations of this supplemental non-GAAP
financial information to our most comparable GAAP information are contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under Results
of Operations . 

We
exclude the following items when calculating AEBITDA, and the following items define our non-GAAP financial measure AEBITDA: 

Interest
 and related party interest expense: Unrelated to core Company operations and excluded to provide more meaningful supplemental information
 regarding the Company s core operational performance. 

Depreciation
 and amortization: Non-cash charge, excluded to provide more meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company s core
 operational performance. 

Goodwill
 and/or asset impairments: Non-cash charge, excluded to provide more meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company s
 core operational performance. 

Equity-based
 compensation: Non-cash compensation provided to employees and service providers, excluded to provide more meaningful supplemental
 information regarding the Company s core cash impacted operational performance. 

Change
 in estimated acquisition earn-out payables: An earn-out liability is a liability to the seller upon an acquisition which is contingent
 on future earnings. These liabilities are valued at each reporting period and the changes are reported as either a gain or loss in
 the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables account in the consolidated statements of operations. The gain or loss is non-cash,
 can be highly volatile and overall is not deemed relevant to ongoing operations, thus, it s excluded to provide more meaningful
 supplemental information regarding the Company s core operational performance. 

Recognition
 and change in fair value of warrant liabilities: This account includes changes to derivative warrant liabilities which are valued
 at each reporting period and could result in either a gain or loss. The period changes do not impact cash, can be highly volatile,
 and are unrelated to ongoing operations, and thus are excluded to provide more meaningful supplemental information regarding the
 Company s core operational performance. 

Other
 income (expense), net: Includes non-routine income or expenses and other individually de minimis items and is thus excluded as unrelated
 to core operations of the company. 

Transactional
 costs: This includes expenses related to mergers, acquisitions, financings and refinancings, and amendments or modification to indebtedness.
 These costs are unrelated to primary Company operations and are excluded to provide more meaningful supplemental information regarding
 the Company s core operational performance. 

Non-recuring
 costs: This account includes non-recurring non-operational items, related to costs incurred for a legal suit the Company has filed
 against one of the third parties involved in the discontinued operations and was excluded to provide more meaningful supplemental
 information regarding the Company s core operational performance. 

Loss
 from discontinued operations before tax: This account includes the net results from discontinued operations, and since discontinued,
 are unrelated to the Company s ongoing operations and thus excluded to provide more meaningful supplemental information regarding
 the Company s core operational performance.

Liquidity
and capital resources 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had a cash balance of approximately 2,354,000 and working capital of approximately 431,000, compared with a cash balance
of approximately 2,739,000 and working capital of approximately 1,189,000 at December 31, 2023. During the first quarter of 2024, the
Company entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement with EF Hutton LLC as sales agent (the ATM Agreement ), pursuant
to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time through the sales agent, shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering
price as determined by the then in effect prospectus supplement to the base prospectus included in the registration statement (the ATM
Capacity ). 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold and issued respectively 658,088 and 561,131 shares of common stock
under the ATM Agreement, at an average price of 4.56, receiving aggregate proceeds, net of 176,509 in agent commissions and legal
and other fees, of 2,824,227. As of the date of filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the net remaining ATM Capacity was
 902,000. 

Inflation 

The
Company generally may be impacted by rising costs for certain inflation-sensitive operating expenses such as labor, employee benefits,
and facility leases. The Company believes inflation could have a material impact on pricing and operating expenses in future periods
due to the state of the economy and current inflation rates.

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The
term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), refers to controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without
limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to a company s management,
including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance
of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible
controls and procedures. 

Our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of
September 30, 2024, and determined them to be effective as of September 30, 2024. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

During
fiscal year 2024, the Company revised its internal controls over its goodwill evaluation process to ensure that any testing performed
at interim dates are rolled forward to the reporting date of the relevant financial statements. Aside from the foregoing, there have
been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the
Exchange Act, during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings. 

We
are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, arising in the ordinary course of business. While
the outcome of these claims cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not believe the outcome of any of these matters will
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, and accordingly, no legal contingencies
are accrued as of September 30, 2024. Litigation relating to the insurance brokerage industry is not uncommon. As such we, from time
to time have been, subject to such litigation. No assurances can be given with respect to the extent or outcome of any such litigation
in the future. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors. 

Investing in our common stock involves

in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as the same may be updated from time to time. As a smaller reporting
company, the Company is not required to disclose material changes to the risk factors that were contained in the Company s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as updated from time to time.
