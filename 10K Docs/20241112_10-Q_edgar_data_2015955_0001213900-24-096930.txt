units at per unit (the Units ), which included
the full exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in the amount of Units at per Unit, which is discussed
in Note 3 (the Initial Public Offering ), and the sale of an aggregate of private placement warrants (the
 Private Placement Warrants to the Sponsor and Cantor Fitzgerald Co., the representative of the underwriters
of the Initial Public Offering, at a price of per warrant, or in the aggregate, in a private placement that closed simultaneously
with the Initial Public Offering. Each Unit consists of Class A ordinary share and redeemable warrant. Of those
 Private Placement Warrants, the Sponsor purchased Private Placement Warrants and Cantor Fitzgerald Co.
has purchased Private Placement Warrants. Each whole warrant entitles the holder to purchase Class A ordinary share
at a price of per share. The Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net
proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended
to be generally applied toward consummating a Business Combination (less deferred underwriting commissions). 

Transaction
costs amounted to consisting of of cash underwriting fee, of deferred underwriting fee, and 
of other offering costs. 

The
Company s Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least
 of the net balance in the trust account (as defined below) (excluding the amount of deferred underwriting discounts held and taxes
payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the signing an agreement to enter into a Business Combination. However,
the Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires or more of the outstanding
voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register
as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ). There
is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination. 

Upon
the closing of the Initial Public Offering, management placed an aggregate of per Unit sold in the Initial Public Offering in
a Trust Account (the Trust Account that may only be invested in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity
of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act, which
invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations; the holding of these assets in this form is intended to be temporary
and for the sole purpose of facilitating the intended business combination. To mitigate the risk that might be deemed to be an investment
company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, which risk increases the longer that the Company holds investments in the Trust Account,
the Company may, at any time (based on management team s ongoing assessment of all factors related to the potential status under
the Investment Company Act), instruct the trustee to liquidate the investments held in the Trust Account and instead to hold the funds
in the Trust Account in cash or in an interest bearing demand deposit account at a bank. Except with respect to interest earned on the
funds held in the Trust Account that may be released to the Company to pay its taxes, if any, the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering
and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants will not be released from the Trust Account until the earliest of (i) the completion
of the Company s initial Business Combination, (ii) the redemption of the Company s public shares if the Company is
unable to complete the initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering or by such
earlier liquidation date as our board of directors may approve unless further extended by shareholder approval (the Completion
Window ), subject to applicable law, or (iii) the redemption of the Company s public shares properly submitted in connection
with a shareholder vote to amend the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to (A) modify the
substance or timing of the Company s obligation to allow redemption in connection with the initial Business Combination or to redeem
 of the Company s public shares if the Company has not consummated an initial Business Combination within the Completion Window
or (B) with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders rights or pre-initial Business Combination
activity. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could become subject to the claims of the Company s creditors, if any, which
could have priority over the claims of the Company s public shareholders.

per public share. 

The
ordinary shares subject to redemption were recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the
Initial Public Offering, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. In such case, if the Company seeks shareholder
approval, a majority of the issued and outstanding shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. 

The
Company will have only the duration of the Completion Window to complete the initial Business Combination. However, if the Company is
unable to complete its initial Business Combination within the Completion Window, the Company will, as promptly as reasonably possible,
but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the
aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (less taxes payable
and up to of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption
will constitute full and complete payment for the public shares and completely extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders
(including the right to receive further liquidation or other distributions, if any), subject to the Company s obligations under
Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and subject to the other requirements of applicable law. 

The
Sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with the Company, pursuant to which they have agreed to (i) waive
their redemption rights with respect to the Class B ordinary shares initially purchased by the Company s sponsor in a private placement
prior to the Initial Public Offering founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of the initial
Business Combination; (ii) waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with
a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association; (iii) waive
their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to their founder shares if the Company fails to complete
the initial Business Combination within the Completion Window, although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust
Account with respect to any public shares they hold if the Company fails to complete the initial Business Combination within the Completion
Window and to liquidating distributions from assets outside the trust account; and (iv) vote any founder shares held by them and
any public shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering (including in open market and privately-negotiated transactions)
in favor of the initial Business Combination (except that any public shares such parties may purchase in compliance with the requirements
of Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act would not be voted in favor of approving the Business Combination). 

The
Company s Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services
rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has entered into a written letter of
intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or Business Combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account
to below the lesser of (i) per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the Trust Account as
of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets,
less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed
a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply
to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including
liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). However, the Company has not asked
the Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor has the Company independently verified whether the Sponsor has sufficient
funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and the Company believes that the Sponsor s only assets are securities of the Company.
Therefore, the Company cannot assure that the Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had of cash and working capital of . 

In
connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 205-40, Presentation
of Financials Statements Going Concern, ASC 205-40 ), the Company has sufficient
funds for the working capital needs of the Company until a minimum of one year from the date of issuance of these condensed financial
statements. The Company cannot assure that its plans to consummate an Initial Business Combination will be successful. 

The Company does not believe it will need to raise
additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating its business. However, if the Company s estimate of the
costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a Business Combination are less than the actual
amount necessary to do so, the Company may have insufficient funds available to operate its business prior to its initial Business Combination.
Moreover, the Company may need to obtain additional financing either to complete its Business Combination or because the Company becomes
obligated to redeem a significant number of its public shares upon completion of its Business Combination, in which case the Company may
issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination.

discussed herein. The warrants cannot be exercised until 30 days after the completion of the initial Business Combination, and will
expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, five years after the completion of the initial Business Combination or earlier
upon redemption or liquidation. 

The
Company will not be obligated to deliver any Class A ordinary shares pursuant to the exercise of a warrant and will have no obligation
to settle such warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the Class A ordinary shares
underlying the warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current. No warrant will be exercisable and the Company
will not be obligated to issue a Class A ordinary share upon exercise of a warrant unless the Class A ordinary share issuable
upon such warrant exercise has been registered, qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence
of the registered holder of the warrants. In the event that the conditions in the two immediately preceding sentences are not satisfied
with respect to a warrant, the holder of such warrant will not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value
and expire worthless. In no event will the Company be required to net cash settle any warrant. In the event that a registration statement
is not effective for the exercised warrants, the purchaser of a unit containing such warrant will have paid the full purchase price for
the unit solely for the Class A ordinary share underlying such unit. 

Under
the terms of the warrant agreement, the Company has agreed that, as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 20 business days,
after the closing of its Business Combination, it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC a post-effective
amendment to the registration statement for the Initial Public Offering or a new registration statement covering the registration under
the Securities Act of the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants and thereafter will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the same to become effective within 60 business days following the Company s initial business
combination and to maintain a current prospectus relating to the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants
until the expiration of the warrants in accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement. If a registration statement covering
the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the sixtieth (60 th business day
after the closing of the initial Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement
and during any period when the Company will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless
basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption. Notwithstanding the above, if the
Class A ordinary shares are at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that they
satisfy the definition of a covered security under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, the Company may, at
its option, require holders of public warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a cashless basis in accordance with
Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event the Company so elects, the Company will not be required to file or
maintain in effect a registration statement, and in the event the Company does not so elect, the Company will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. 

If
the holders exercise their public warrants on a cashless basis, they would pay the warrant exercise price by surrendering the warrants
for that number of Class A ordinary shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of Class A
ordinary shares underlying the warrants, multiplied by the excess of the fair market value of the Class A ordinary
shares over the exercise price of the warrants by (y) the fair market value. The fair market value is the average
reported closing price of the Class A ordinary shares for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day
prior to the date on which the notice of exercise is received by the warrant agent or on which the notice of redemption is sent to the
holders of warrants, as applicable.

period commencing at least 30 days after completion of the Company s initial business combination and ending three business days

agreements of the Company s initial shareholders with respect to any founder shares (the Lock-up ). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if (1) the closing price of the Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds per share (as adjusted for
share sub-divisions, share capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any trading days within
any -trading day period commencing after the initial Business Combination or (2) if the Company consummates a transaction
after the initial Business Combination which results in the Company s shareholders having the right to exchange their shares for
cash, securities or other property, the founder shares will be released from the Lock-up.

condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere
in this Quarterly Report. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes forward-looking statements
that involve risks and uncertainties. 

Special
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

This
Quarterly Report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and
Section 21E of the Exchange Act that are not historical facts and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to
differ materially from those expected and projected. All statements, other than statements of historical fact included in this Form 10-Q

of Operations regarding the completion of the Business Combination, the Company s financial position, business strategy
and the plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. Words such as expect,

Factors section of the Company s final prospectus for the Initial Public Offering filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(the SEC ). The Company s securities filings can be accessed on the EDGAR section of the SEC s website at www.sec.gov.
Except as expressly required by applicable securities law, the Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any
forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 

Overview 

We
are a blank check company incorporated in the Cayman Islands on February 21, 2024 formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, amalgamation,
share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar Business Combination with one or more businesses. We intend
to effectuate our Business Combination using cash derived from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private
Placement Warrants, our shares, debt or a combination of cash, shares and debt. 

We
expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete
a Business Combination will be successful. 

Results
of Operations 

We
have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities from February 21, 2024 (inception) through
September 30, 2024 were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public Offering, described below, completion
of the Initial Public Offering, and following the Initial Public Offering, identifying a target company for a Business Combination. We
do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our Business Combination. We generate non-operating income
in the form of interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company
(for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net income of 3,220,747, which consists of interest income on marketable securities
held in the Trust Account of 3,397,997, offset by general and administrative and formation costs of 177,250. 

For
the period from February 21, 2024 (inception) through September 30, 2024, we had net income of 3,327,965, which consists of interest
income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 3,638,827, offset by general and administrative and formation costs of
 310,862. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

On
June 20, 2024, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 23,000,000 Units at 10.00 per Unit, which included the full exercise
by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in the amount of 3,000,000 Units at 10.00 per Unit, which is discussed in Note 3
(the Initial Public Offering ), and the sale of an aggregate of 6,000,000 Private Placement Warrants to the Sponsor, the
representative of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering, at a price of 1.00 per Private Placement Warrants, or 6,000,000
in the aggregate, in a private placement that closed simultaneously with the Initial Public Offering. 

16 

For
the period from February 21, 2024 (inception) through September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was 531,599. Net income
of 3,327,965 was affected by interest earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 3,638,827 and payment
of formation costs through promissory note of 5,000. Changes in operating assets and liabilities used 225,737 of cash for operating
activities. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 233,638,827 (including approximately 3,638,827 of
interest income) consisting of U.S. Treasury Bills with a maturity of 185 days or less. We may withdraw interest from the Trust Account
to pay taxes, if any. We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest
earned on the Trust Account (less income taxes payable), to complete our Business Combination. To the extent that our share capital or
debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account
will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our
growth strategies. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 1,000,526. We intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Account primarily to identify and
evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or
similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements
of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete a Business Combination. 

In
order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor, or certain
of our officers and directors or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete a Business
Combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the
working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for
such repayment. Up to 1,500,000 of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into private placement warrants of the post Business
Combination entity at a price of 1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. 

We
do not believe we will need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business. However,
if our estimate of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a Business Combination
are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our Business
Combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our Business Combination or because we become obligated
to redeem a significant number of our Public Shares upon consummation of our Business Combination, in which case we may issue additional
securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. We do
not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as
variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have
not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments
of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. 

Contractual
obligations 

We
do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement
to pay an aggregate of 15,000 per month for office space, utilities, and secretarial and administrative support. 

The
underwriters had a 45-day option from the date of the Initial Public Offering to purchase up to an additional 3,000,000 units to
cover over-allotment. On June 20, 2024, simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the underwriter elected to fully
exercise the over-allotment option to purchase the additional 3,000,000 Units at a price of 10.00 per Unit. 

17 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

The
preparation of condensed financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported.
Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgement. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect
of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financials statements, which management consider in
formulating its estimated, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results
could materially differ from those estimates. As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any critical accounting estimates to be disclosed. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise

processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons
performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting
officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal quarter
ended September 30, 2024, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation,
our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer have concluded that during the period covered by this
report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level and, accordingly, provided reasonable assurance
that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 covered by this

reporting.
