 shares of Company common stock. The transaction qualified as a tax-free reorganization for federal income tax purposes and provided Cambridge shareholders with a tax-free exchange of their shares of Cambridge common stock for Company common stock as the consideration they received in the merger. In connection with the merger, Citadel MS 2023, Inc. Merger Sub ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, merged with and into Cambridge, with Cambridge continuing as the surviving entity. Immediately after the merger, Cambridge merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving entity. Immediately following, Cambridge Trust, a wholly owned subsidiary of Cambridge, merged with and into Eastern Bank, with Eastern Bank continuing as the surviving entity. The Company issued million shares of its common stock in the merger. Based upon the closing price of Company common stock on July 12, 2024 of per share, the transaction is valued at million, which includes cash paid in-lieu of fractional shares and recognition of restricted stock units RSU and performance share units PSU service accruals for service accrued by Cambridge personnel prior to the merger. In addition to increasing its loan and deposit base, the merger enabled the Company to expand its wealth management customer base and service offerings, which includes comprehensive investment management, as well as trust administration, estate settlement, and financial planning services. 
 The merger was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations . Under this method of accounting, the respective assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values. The excess of consideration paid over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired totaled million and was recorded as goodwill. The results of Cambridge s operations were included in the Company s consolidated financial statements subsequent to the merger date. 
 The calculation of goodwill is subject to change for up to one year after the closing date of the transaction as additional information relative to closing date estimates and uncertainties becomes available, including the filing of the 2024 tax return for Cambridge. As the Company finalizes its analysis of these assets and liabilities, there may be adjustments to the recorded carrying values.

 Fair Value Measurement of Assets Assumed and Liabilities Assumed 
 The methods used to determine the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Cambridge merger were as follows: 
 Investment Securities 
 The estimated fair values of the available for sale debt securities and held-to-maturity debt securities, primarily comprised of U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises mortgage-backed securities, U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises obligations, corporate debt securities, municipal securities, and U.S. Treasury securities carried on Cambridge s balance sheet, was confirmed using actual sales quotations from sales of the securities, as the Company sold all of the acquired securities immediately following the closing of the merger. Based upon management s determination, a fair value adjustment of million, reflecting a net discount, was recorded on acquired securities and reflects the net unrealized loss position of such securities at the date of merger. Securities acquired that were classified on Cambridge s balance sheet as held-to-maturity were reclassified as available for sale upon the completion of the merger and prior to sale by the Company, reflecting management s intent with respect to such securities. 
 Immediately following the completion of the merger, investment securities acquired through its merger with Cambridge paid down or were sold in their entirety. gain or loss was recognized upon sale as such securities had been recorded by the Company based upon the quoted sale prices in determination of the purchase accounting fair value adjustment. 
 Loans

Table of Contents 

million. 
 Acquired loans were reviewed to determine if any had experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination. Loans meeting established criteria to indicate more-than-insignificant deterioration were identified as purchased credit deteriorated PCD loans, and an allowance for loan losses was calculated using management s best estimate of projected losses over the remaining life of the loan in accordance with current expected credit loss CECL methodology. In connection with the Cambridge merger, the Company recorded an allowance for loan losses on PCD loans of approximately million, which was added to the amortized cost of loans. 
 Allowance for loan losses on PCD loans ) Interest and liquidity discount ) Purchase price of PCD loans (at fair value) 
 For loans acquired without evidence of more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination, also referred to as non-PCD loans, the Company estimated an allowance for loan losses based on the Company's methodology for determining the allowance under CECL. The resulting allowance on non-PCD loans was million, which was recorded through a charge to provision for loan losses on the date of merger. 
 Premises and Equipment 
 The Company acquired branches in the merger as of the date of closing, 5 of which were owned premises. In addition, the Company acquired corporate properties in the merger with Cambridge. The fair value of properties acquired was derived by valuations prepared by an independent third party utilizing a combination of the income approach and the sales comparison approach to value the property as improved. 
 Leases 
 As part of the merger the Company added lease obligations. The Company recorded a million right-of-use asset and a million lease liability for these lease obligations. Lease assets and liabilities were measured using a methodology to estimate the future rental payments over the remaining lease term with discounting using the Company s incremental borrowing rate. The lease term was determined for individual leases based on the Company s assessment of the probability of exercising renewal options. The net effect of any off-market terms in a lease was also discounted and applied to the balance of the lease asset. 
 Core Deposit Intangible 
 The fair value of the core deposit intangible was determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis using a discount rate commensurate with market participants. To calculate cash flows, deposit account servicing costs (net of deposit fee income) and interest expense on deposits were compared to the cost of alternative funding sources available through FHLBB borrowing rates and national brokered CD offering rates. The projected cash flows were developed using projected deposit attrition rates. Management retained a third-party valuation specialist to assist with the determination of projected cash flows, the results of which were reviewed by management. The core deposit intangible totaled million and is being amortized on a cash-flow weighted basis over its estimated useful life of years. 
 Cambridge Trust Wealth Management Customer List and Trade Name Intangibles 
 The fair value of the Cambridge Trust wealth management customer list intangible customer list intangible and trade name intangible trade name intangible were determined based upon discounted cash flow analyses using discount rates commensurate with market participants. The projected cash flows for the customer list intangible were developed using current revenue grown at a constant rate, and projected customer attrition rates were used to allocate those revenues to existing

million and million, respectively, and are being amortized on a cash-flow weighted basis over their estimated useful lives of years and years, respectively. 
 Goodwill 
 The calculation of goodwill is subject to change for up to one year after the date of merger as additional information relative to the closing date estimates and uncertainties become available. As the Company finalizes its review of the acquired assets and liabilities, certain adjustments to the recorded carrying values may be required. The goodwill will be evaluated annually for impairment. The goodwill is t deductible for tax purposes. 
 Bank Owned Life Insurance BOLI 
 Cambridge s BOLI cash surrender value was million with no fair value adjustment. 
 Certificates of Deposit 
 The fair value adjustment for certificates of deposit represents a discount from the value of the contractual repayments of fixed-maturity deposits using prevailing market interest rates for similar-term time deposits. The certificate of deposit discount, which was estimated to be million, is being amortized into income on a level yield amortization method over the contractual life of the deposits. 
 Escrow Deposits of Borrowers 
 Cambridge s escrow deposits of borrowers was million with no fair value adjustment. 
 Merger-Related Expenses 
 The Company recorded merger and acquisition expenses of million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, related to the Cambridge merger. 
 Office occupancy and equipment Data processing Professional services Marketing Other noninterest expense

 Allowance for Loan Losses 
 The allowance for loan losses is established to provide for management s estimate of expected lifetime credit losses on loans measured at amortized cost at the balance sheet date through a provision for loan losses charged to net income. Charge-offs, net of recoveries, are charged directly to the allowance for loan losses. Commercial and residential loans are charged-off in the period in which they are deemed uncollectible. Delinquent loans in these product types are subject to ongoing review and analysis to determine if a charge-off in the current period is appropriate. For consumer loans, policies and procedures exist that require charge-off consideration upon a certain triggering event depending on the product type.

The adjustment represents a million decrease to the allowance attributable to the change in accounting methodology for estimating the allowance for loan losses resulting from the Company s adoption of the standard. 
 The Company recorded provisions for allowance for loan losses of million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a day-2 provision for allowance for loan losses of million related to non-PCD loans acquired in the merger which closed on July 12, 2024. Excluding this amount, the provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 amounted to million. Management determined a provision to be necessary for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to million in charge-offs of commercial real estate loans including one commercial real estate loan, of which million was partially charged-off, collateralized by a property in the office risk segment which transitioned to non-accrual status during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and had not been previously reserved for on a specific reserve basis, and due to an increase in specific reserves for commercial real estate loans collateralized by a property in the office risk segment. In addition, the Company recorded an allowance for loan losses of million related to PCD loans acquired in the merger with Cambridge. This amount represented the initial allowance on such loans and was recorded with a corresponding gross-up of the loan amortized cost balance in connection with purchase accounting therefore not increasing the provision for allowance for loan losses. Refer to Note 3, Mergers and Acquisitions for additional discussion. 
 Change in Accounting Estimate 
 In connection with its quarterly computation of the allowance for loan losses, management performs back-testing of the model results compared to actual balances and losses as a part of generating the accounting estimate. In the third quarter of 2024, in response to back-testing results, management updated its prepayment estimate, resulting in an increase to the loan portfolio s weighted average life, and qualitative reserve framework which reflects management s best estimate of expected credit losses. The net effect of the such changes to the allowance for loan losses estimation process was an increase of approximately million. 
 Reserve for Unfunded Commitments 
 Management evaluates the need for a reserve on unfunded lending commitments in a manner consistent with loans held for investment. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s reserve for unfunded lending commitments was million and million, respectively, which is recorded within other liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company s adoption of ASU 2022-02 on January 1, 2023 did not impact the reserve for unfunded lending commitments.

in exposure, an annual review is conducted which includes the review of the business score and loan and deposit account performance. The Company supplements performance data with current business credit scores for the business banking portfolio on a quarterly basis. Unrated commercial and business banking loans are generally restricted to commercial exposure of less than million. Loans included in this category generally are not required to provide regular financial reporting or regular covenant monitoring. 
 For purposes of estimating the allowance for loan losses, unrated loans are considered in the same manner as Pass rated loans. Unrated loans are included with Pass rated loans for disclosure purposes. 
 1-10 Risk Rating Pass 
 Loans with a risk rating of 1-10 are classified as Pass and are comprised of loans that range from substantially risk free which indicates borrowers of unquestioned credit standing, well-established national companies with a very strong financial condition, and loans fully secured by policy conforming cash levels, through low pass which indicates acceptable rated loans that may be experiencing weak cash flow, impending lease rollover or minor liquidity concerns. 
 11 Risk Rating Special Mention (Potential Weakness) 
 Loans to borrowers in this category exhibit potential weaknesses or downward trends deserving management s close attention. While potentially weak, no loss of principal or interest is envisioned. Included in this category are borrowers who are performing as agreed, are weak when compared to industry standards, may be experiencing an interim loss and may be in declining industries. An element of asset quality, financial flexibility or management is below average. The Company does not consider borrowers within this category as new business prospects. Borrowers rated special mention may find it difficult to obtain alternative financing from traditional bank sources. 
 12 Risk Rating Substandard (Well-Defined Weakness) 
 Loans with a risk-rating of 12 exhibit well-defined weaknesses that, if not corrected, may jeopardize the orderly liquidation of the debt. A loan is classified as substandard if it is inadequately protected by the repayment capacity of the obligor or by the collateral pledged. Specifically, repayment under market rates and terms, or by the requirements under the existing loan documents, is in jeopardy, but no loss of principal or interest is envisioned. There is a possibility that a partial loss of principal and/or interest will occur in the future if the deficiencies are not corrected. Loss potential, while existing in the aggregate portfolio of substandard assets, does not have to exist in individual assets classified as substandard. Non-accrual is possible, but not mandatory, in this class.

days delinquent if the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. Non-accrual loans and loans that are more than days past due but still accruing interest are considered non-performing loans. 
 Non-accrual loans may be returned to an accrual status when principal and interest payments are no longer delinquent, and the risk characteristics of the loan have improved to the extent that there no longer exists a concern as to the collectability of principal and interest. Loans are considered past due based upon the number of days delinquent according to their contractual terms. 
 A loan is expected to remain on non-accrual status until it becomes current with respect to principal and interest, the loan is liquidated, or the loan is determined to be uncollectible and is charged-off against the allowance for loan losses.

 (1) The loans on non-accrual status and without an ACL as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, were primarily comprised of collateral dependent loans for which the fair value of the underlying loan collateral exceeded the loan carrying value. 
 The amount of interest income recognized on non-accrual loans during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was not significant. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no loans greater than 90 days past due and still accruing. 
 It is the Company s policy to reverse any accrued interest when a loan is put on non-accrual status and, generally, to record any payments received from a borrower related to a loan on non-accrual status as a reduction of the amortized cost basis of the loan. Accrued interest reversed against interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was not significant. 
 For collateral values for residential mortgage and home equity loans, the Company relies primarily upon third-party valuation information from certified appraisers and values are generally based upon recent appraisals of the underlying collateral, brokers opinions based upon recent sales of comparable properties, or estimated auction or liquidation values less estimated costs to sell. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had collateral-dependent residential mortgage and home equity loans totaling million and million, respectively. 
 For collateral-dependent commercial loans, the amount of the allowance for loan losses is individually assessed based upon the fair value of the collateral. Various types of collateral are used, including real estate, inventory, equipment, accounts receivable, securities and cash, among others. For commercial real estate loans, the Company relies primarily upon third-party valuation information from certified appraisers and values are generally based upon recent appraisals of the underlying collateral, brokers opinions based upon recent sales of comparable properties, estimated equipment auction or liquidation values, income capitalization, or a combination of income capitalization and comparable sales.

Refer to Note 3, Mergers and Acquisitions for further information regarding the Company s merger with Cambridge. 
 The Company quantitatively assesses goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or sooner if an event occurs or circumstances change which might indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount. The Company has identified and assigned goodwill to reporting unit - the banking business. 
 The Company performed its annual assessment for the banking business as of September 30, 2024. The assessment included a comparison of the banking reporting unit s carrying value of equity to estimated fair value of equity using the market capitalization method of the market approach. The Company evaluated conditions as of the assessment date and how a market participant would evaluate a control premium for the banking reporting unit. The implied control premium was estimated using the discounted cash flow method of the income approach by evaluating the present value of market participant cost savings and synergies. Based upon the assessment, it was determined there was no impairment of the Company s goodwill as of September 30, 2024. 
 Other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Management performed a review of the Company s intangible assets as of September 30, 2024 and concluded that it was not more-likely-than-not that the carrying amount of other intangible assets may not be recoverable. Management had also previously performed an assessment as of December 31, 2023 and determined there was no indication of impairment related to intangible assets.

 The increase in income tax expense, and resulting net expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 despite a pre-tax net loss, from a net benefit of million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to net expense of million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the establishment of a million valuation allowance in the third quarter of 2024 for the anticipated lost state tax benefit associated with the projected 2024 Massachusetts state tax net operating loss which cannot be carried over. The state tax net operating losses were due to the tax losses incurred as a result of the liquidation of the securities acquired in connection with the Company s merger with Cambridge. 
 The Company established a million valuation allowance in the first quarter of 2023 against the capital loss carryforward deferred tax asset which resulted from the sale of securities for the amount of deferred tax asset management believed was not more-likely-than-not to be realized. The income tax benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the reversal of the remainder of the federal portion of the valuation allowance established in the first quarter of 2023. The amount reversed during the three months ended September 30, 2023 was million. As a result of the execution of the agreement to sell the Company s insurance agency business in September 2023 and the determination of the resulting capital gain, management determined it to be more-likely-than-not that the Company will realize federal capital losses related to the securities sale. Consequently, the Company reversed the associated federal valuation allowance previously established as management had determined it was more-likely-than-not that the entirety of the federal deferred tax asset related to the loss on such securities sales would be realized. In addition, the Company recognized an income tax benefit associated with a change in management s estimate of annual pre-tax loss for purposes of determining the Company s income tax provision. 
 The increase in income tax expense from a net benefit of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to net expense of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to pre-tax losses resulting from losses on sales of available for sale securities in the first quarter of 2023 and the establishment of a valuation allowance in the third quarter of 2024 described above.

 The Company has an unfunded Defined Benefit Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan DB SERP that provides certain Company officers upon their retirement with defined pension benefits in excess of qualified plan limits imposed by U.S. federal tax law. The DB SERP has a plan year end of December 31. 
 In connection with the Company s merger with Cambridge, the Company acquired Cambridge's DB SERP. In 2016, Cambridge s Board of Directors discontinued the use of DB SERPs for new entrants to Cambridge s non-qualified retirement programs. Expense for the DB SERPs is recognized over the executive s service life utilizing the projected unit credit actuarial cost method. All participants of Cambridge s DB SERP were deemed to be fully vested upon the closing of the merger. 
 In addition, the Company has an unfunded Benefit Equalization Plan BEP to provide retirement benefits to certain employees whose retirement benefits under the qualified pension plan are limited per the Internal Revenue Code. The BEP has a plan year end of October 31. 
 The Company also has an unfunded Outside Directors Retainer Continuance Plan ODRCP that provides pension benefits to outside directors who retire from service. The ODRCP has a plan year end of December 31. Effective December 31, 2020, the Company closed the ODRCP to new participants and froze benefit accruals for active participants. 
 In connection with the Company s merger with Cambridge, the Company acquired Cambridge s post-retirement health care plan. Benefits for the postretirement health care plan are based on years of service. Expenses for the postretirement health care plan are recognized over the employee's service life utilizing the projected unit credit actuarial cost method. Effective November 7, 2019, the postretirement health care plan was frozen for employees hired after that date. The frozen health care plan is not accruing and is only in payout status.

 Share-Based Compensation Plan 
 On November 29, 2021, the shareholders of the Company approved the Eastern Bankshares, Inc. 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2021 Plan ). The 2021 Plan provides for the issuance of up to shares of common stock pursuant to grants of restricted stock, RSUs, non-qualified stock options and incentive stock options, any or all of which can be granted with performance-based vesting conditions. Under the 2021 Plan, shares may be issued as restricted stock or RSUs, including those issued as performance shares and PSUs, and shares may be issued upon the exercise of stock options. These shares may be awarded from the Company s authorized but unissued shares. However, the 2021 Plan permits the grant of additional awards of restricted stock or RSUs above the aforementioned limit, provided that, for each additional share of restricted stock or RSU awarded in excess of such limit, the pool of shares available to be issued upon the exercise of stock options will be reduced by shares. Pursuant to the terms of the 2021 Plan, each of the Company s non-employee directors were automatically granted awards of restricted stock on November 30, 2021. Such restricted stock awards RSAs vest pro-rata on an annual basis over a period. The maximum term for stock options is .

 The maximum amount of time over which the Company is currently hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of forecasted transactions related to the receipt of variable interest on existing financial instruments is years. 
 The Company expects approximately million will be reclassified into interest income, as a reduction of such income, from other comprehensive income related to the Company s active cash flow hedges in the next 12 months as of September 30, 2024. The reclassification is due to anticipated net payments on the swaps based upon the forward curve as of September 30, 2024. 
 Customer-Related Positions 
 Interest rate swaps offered to commercial customers do not qualify as hedges for accounting purposes. These swaps allow the Company to retain variable rate commercial loans while allowing the commercial customer to synthetically fix the loan rate by entering into a variable-to-fixed rate interest rate swap. The Company believes that its exposure to commercial customer derivatives is limited to non-performance by either the customer or the dealer because these contracts are simultaneously matched at inception with an offsetting transaction. 
 Risk participation agreements are entered into as financial guarantees of performance on interest rate swap derivatives. The purchased (asset) or sold (liability) guarantee allow the Company to participate-out (fee paid) or participate-in (fee received) the risk associated with certain derivative positions executed with the borrower by the lead bank in a customer-related interest rate swap derivative. 
 Foreign exchange contracts consist of those offered to commercial customers and those entered into to hedge the Company s foreign currency risk associated with a foreign-currency loan. Neither qualifies as a hedge for accounting purposes. These commercial customer derivatives are offset with matching derivatives with correspondent-bank counterparties in order to minimize foreign exchange rate risk to the Company. Exposure with respect to these derivatives is largely limited to non-performance by either the customer or the other counterparty. Neither the Company nor the correspondent-bank counterparty are required to post collateral but each has established foreign-currency transaction limits to manage the exposure risk. The Company requires its customers to post collateral to minimize risk exposure.

 The Company has agreements with its customer-related interest rate swap derivative counterparties that contain a provision whereby if the Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations. 
 The Company also has agreements with certain of its customer-related interest rate swap derivative correspondent-bank counterparties that contain a provision whereby if the Company fails to maintain its status as a well-capitalized institution, then the counterparty could terminate the derivative positions and the Company would be required to settle its obligations under the agreements. 
 The Company s exposure related to its customer-related interest rate swap derivatives consists of exposure on cleared derivative transactions and exposure on non-cleared derivative transactions. 
 Cleared derivative transactions are with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, or CME, and exposure is settled to market daily, with additional credit exposure related to initial-margin collateral pledged to CME at trade execution. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had exposure to CME for settled variation margin in excess of the customer-related and non-customer-related interest rate swap termination values of million and million, respectively. In addition, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had posted initial-margin collateral in the form of U.S. Treasury notes amounting to million and million, respectively, to CME for these derivatives. The U.S. Treasury notes were considered restricted assets and were included in available for sale securities within the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 At September 30, 2024 there were customer-related interest rate swap derivatives with credit-risk contingent features in a net liability position. At December 31, 2023, there was million of customer-related interest rate swap derivatives with credit-risk contingent features in a net liability position. The Company has minimum collateral posting thresholds with its customer-related interest rate swap derivative correspondent-bank counterparties to the extent that the Company has a liability position with the correspondent-bank counterparties. The Company was required to post cash collateral for interest rate swaps with correspondent-bank counterparties as of September 30, 2024. At December 31, 2023, the Company posted million, which was considered to be a restricted asset and was included in other short-term investments within the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the Company had breached any of these provisions at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023, it would have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at the termination value. In addition, the Company had cross-default provisions with its commercial customer loan agreements which provide cross-collateralization with the customer loan collateral.

Therefore, these securities were categorized as Level 2 given the use of observable inputs. 
 The fair value of U.S. government-sponsored residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities were estimated using either a matrix or benchmarks. The inputs used include benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, and issuer spreads. Therefore, these securities were categorized as Level 2 given the use of observable inputs. 
 The fair value of state and municipal bonds were estimated using a valuation matrix with inputs including observable bond interest rate tables, recent transactions, and yield relationships. Therefore, these securities were categorized as Level 2 given the use of observable inputs. 
 Fair value was based on the value of one unit without regard to any premium or discount that may result from concentrations of ownership of a financial instrument, possible tax ramifications, or estimated transaction costs. 
 Loans Held for Sale 
 The fair value of loans held for sale, whose carrying amounts approximate fair value, was estimated using the anticipated market price based upon pricing indications provided by investor banks. These assets were classified as Level 2 given the use of observable inputs. 
 Loans 
 The fair value of commercial construction, commercial and industrial lines of credit, and certain other consumer loans was estimated by discounting the contractual cash flows using interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality. 
 For commercial, commercial real estate, residential real estate, automobile, and consumer home equity loans, fair value was estimated by discounting contractual cash flows adjusted for prepayment estimates using interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality.

million. The agreement also provided for the assumption of certain liabilities of the insurance agency business by Gallagher. Management made the decision to sell certain assets of its insurance agency business to recognize the valuation premium of the business, while allowing the Company to focus on growth and strategic initiatives of its core banking business. 
 In September 2023, following the approval of the sale by the Company s board of directors, the Company reclassified substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of its insurance agency business as held for sale in connection with a planned disposition of the business. A business is classified as held for sale when management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the business, the sale is probable to occur during the next 12 months at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value, and certain other criteria are met. In accordance with ASC 205, Presentation of Financial Statements , the Company classifies operations as discontinued when they meet all the criteria to be classified as held for sale and when the sale represents a strategic shift that will have a major impact on the Company s financial condition and results of operations. 
 On October 31, 2023, the Company completed the sale of its insurance agency business for net cash consideration at closing of million, subject to customary post-closing working capital adjustments. The net cash proceeds at closing included the gross purchase price pursuant to the agreement of million and an estimated working capital adjustment of million, which were reduced by transaction expenses of million and the settlement of certain obligations of the Company primarily related to employee post-retirement liabilities that originated prior to closing of million. In addition, the Company transferred million in fiduciary cash to Gallagher upon closing which is included in the determination of the gain on sale as of December 31, 2023 but was not included in the amount of net cash consideration of million. In connection with the sale, the Company recognized a gain on sale of million, which was subject to certain post-closing adjustments during the 120 day post-closing settlement period which ended on February 28, 2024. The amount of the post-closing settlement was not material. The Company recognized indirect noninterest expenses associated with the sale of approximately million.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results could differ from these estimates. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in detail in our 2023 Form 10-K, as updated by the notes to our Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements accompanying this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 In September 2023, following the approval of the sale of our insurance agency business by our board of directors, we reclassified our insurance agency business as held for sale in connection with a planned disposition of the business. Accordingly, the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and Consolidated Statements of Cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 present discontinued operations. For further discussion, refer to Note 18, Discontinued Operations within the Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 We completed our merger with Cambridge on July 12, 2024. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, we recognize assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values as of the date of acquisition, with the related transaction costs expensed in the period incurred. We used third party valuation specialists to assist in the determination of fair 
 68 

Table of Contents 

value of certain assets and liabilities at the merger date, including loans, core deposit intangible, trade name intangible, customer list intangible, premises and equipment, and certificates of deposit. While we used our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the merger date, the estimates are inherently uncertain. The calculation of goodwill is subject to change for up to one year after the date of merger as additional information relative to the closing date estimates and uncertainties become available. As we finalize our review of the acquired assets and liabilities, certain adjustments to the recorded carrying values may be required. The allowance for loan losses on PCD loans was recognized within business combination accounting. The allowance for loan losses on non-PCD loans was recognized as a provision expense in the same period as the business combination. For further discussion of our merger with Cambridge, refer to Note 3, Mergers and Acquisitions within the Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 There have been no other material changes in critical accounting policies during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Overview 
 We are a bank holding company, and our principal subsidiary, Eastern Bank, is a Massachusetts-chartered bank that has served the banking needs of our customers since 1818. Our business philosophy is to operate as a diversified financial services enterprise providing a broad array of banking and other financial services primarily to retail, commercial and small business customers. We had total assets of 25.5 billion and 21.1 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We are subject to comprehensive regulation and examination by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, the New Hampshire Banking Department, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Our business consists of a full range of banking, lending (commercial, residential and consumer), savings and small business offerings, including our wealth management and trust operations that we conduct through our Cambridge Trust Wealth Management division. Previously, our wealth management and trust operations were conducted through Eastern Wealth Management. Following our merger with Cambridge Bancorp, described further below, the wealth management divisions of both banks now operate under the Cambridge Trust Wealth Management, a division of Eastern Bank, brand name. 
 On July 12, 2024, we completed our previously announced merger with Cambridge Bancorp Cambridge and Cambridge Trust Company Cambridge Trust ). In accordance with the terms of the definitive merger agreement, through which we agreed to acquire Cambridge through a merger with the Company as the surviving entity, each share of Cambridge common stock was exchanged for 4.956 shares of our common stock. The transaction qualifies as a tax-free reorganization for federal income tax purposes and provided Cambridge shareholders with a tax-free exchange of their shares of Cambridge common stock in exchange for our common stock as the consideration they received in the merger. We issued 38.9 million shares of our common stock in the exchange which resulted in a transaction value of approximately 580.6 million based upon the closing price of our common stock on July 12, 2024 of 14.87 per share. 
 Cambridge, a Massachusetts corporation, was a federally registered bank holding company headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Cambridge Trust, a Massachusetts-chartered trust company formed in 1890, was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cambridge that operated through a network of 18 full-service banking offices in eastern Massachusetts and New Hampshire with 5.3 billion in total assets and 3.9 billion in deposits as of July 12, 2024. Cambridge s core services also included wealth management. Through its wealth management group, which had offices in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, it offered comprehensive investment management, as well as trust administration, estate settlement, and financial planning services. Cambridge had assets under management and administration of approximately 5.0 billion as of July 12, 2024. Cambridge Trust s wholly owned subsidiary, Cambridge Trust Company of New Hampshire Inc. CTCNH ), offered trust services pursuant to New Hampshire law and was regulated by the New Hampshire Banking Department. CTCNH is now a subsidiary of Eastern Bank. 
 In recent years, we managed our business under two business segments: our banking business and our insurance agency business. On October 31, 2023, we sold substantially all of the assets and transferred certain liabilities of our insurance agency business. In the third quarter of 2023, following management s decision to sell our insurance agency business, we reclassified the related assets and liabilities to assets and liabilities of discontinued operations, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accordingly, the results of discontinued operations were reclassified to net income from discontinued operations on our Consolidated Statements of Income. For additional discussion of discontinued operations, refer to Note 18, Discontinued Operations within the Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The following discussion excludes amounts reported as discontinued operations. 
 Net loss and net income from continuing operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, computed in accordance with GAAP was 6.2 million and 58.8 million, respectively, as compared to net income and net loss from continuing operations of 63.5 million and 94.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, representing a decrease of 109.8 and an increase of 162.4 , respectively. The decrease in net income 
 69 

Table of Contents 

from continuing operations to a net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to one-time expenses associated with our merger with Cambridge including the non-PCD loan day-2 provision for the allowance for loan losses, which was recorded subsequent to the completion of the merger and is hereafter referred to as the non-PCD loan day-2 provision for the allowance for loan losses, and merger and acquisition expenses recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Refer to the later sections titled Results of Operations within this Item 2 for additional discussion. The increase in net income from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from a net loss from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the sale of available for sale securities at a loss in connection with our balance sheet repositioning completed in March 2023 which resulted in a net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and was partially offset by the previously indicated one-time expenses associated with our merger with Cambridge including the non-PCD loan day-2 provision for the allowance for loan losses and merger and acquisition expenses. Refer to the later section titled Results of Operations within this Item 2 for additional discussion. 
 Net loss and income from continuing operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and net income and net loss from continuing operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, included items that our management considers non-core, which management excludes for purposes of assessing our operating net income, a non-GAAP financial measure. Operating net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 49.7 million and 124.3 million, respectively, compared to operating net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 52.1 million and 146.3 million, respectively, representing decreases of 4.6 and 15.1 , respectively. These decreases were primarily due to higher noninterest expense on an operating basis for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Results of Operations within this Item 2 for a reconciliation of operating net income to net income on a GAAP basis and further discussion of noninterest income and noninterest expense. 
 Banking Business 
 Our banking business offers a range of commercial, retail, wealth management and banking service, and consists primarily of attracting deposits from the general public, including municipalities, and investing those deposits, together with borrowings and funds generated from operations, to originate loans in a variety of sectors and to invest in securities. Our financial condition and results of operations depend primarily on (i) attracting and retaining relatively low cost, stable deposits, (ii) using those deposits to originate and acquire loans and earn net interest income and (iii) operating expenses incurred. 
 Lending Activities 
 We use funds obtained from deposits, as well as funds obtained from the FHLBB advances, primarily to originate loans and to invest in securities. Our lending focuses on the following categories of loans: 
 Commercial Lending 
 Commercial and industrial : Loans in this category consist of revolving and term loans extended to businesses and corporate enterprises for the purpose of financing working capital, facilitating equipment purchases and facilitating acquisitions. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had total commercial and industrial loans of 3.3 billion and 3.0 billion, respectively, representing 18.8 and 21.8 , respectively, of our total loans. The primary risk associated with commercial and industrial loans is the ability of borrowers to achieve business results consistent with those projected at origination. Our primary focus for commercial and industrial loans is middle-market companies located in the markets we serve. In addition, we participate in the syndicated loan market and the SNC Program. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, commercial and industrial loans in our SNC Program portfolio totaled 673.7 million and 606.2 million, respectively, or 20.2 and 20.0 , respectively, of our commercial and industrial portfolio, and 51.3 and 45.1 , respectively, of our commercial and industrial SNC Program portfolio were loans to borrowers headquartered in our primary lending market. Our commercial and industrial portfolio also includes our Asset Based Lending Portfolio ABL Portfolio and industrial revenue bonds IRBs ), the balances of which are detailed below: 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our ABL Portfolio totaled 201.8 million and 203.1 million, respectively, or 6.0 and 6.7 , respectively, of our commercial and industrial portfolio. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our commercial and industrial IRB portfolio, which is comprised of municipal bonds issued to finance major capital projects, totaled 934.1 million and 934.5 million, respectively, or 28.0 and 30.8 , respectively, of our commercial and industrial portfolio.

Commercial real estate : Loans in this category include mortgage loans and lines of credit on commercial real estate, both investment and owner occupied. Property types financed include office, industrial, multi-family, affordable housing, retail, hotel, and other type properties. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had total commercial real estate loans of 7.2 billion and 5.5 billion, representing 40.4 and 39.1 , respectively, of our total loans as of each period end. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, owner occupied loans totaled 1.0 billion, representing 13.8 and 18.2 , respectively, of our commercial real estate loans. Collateral values are established by independent third-party appraisals and evaluations. The primary repayment sources include operating income generated by the real estate, permanent debt refinancing and/or the sale of the real estate. Our commercial real estate loan portfolio also includes loans included in our SNC Program portfolio described above. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, commercial real estate loans in our SNC Program portfolio totaled 113.1 million and 86.3 million, respectively, or 1.6 of our commercial real estate loan portfolio at each period end. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 76.1 and 100.0 , respectively, of our commercial real estate SNC Program portfolio were loans to borrowers headquartered in our primary lending market. Our commercial real estate loan portfolio also included IRB loans of 643.9 million and 591.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, representing 9.0 and 10.8 , respectively, of our commercial real estate portfolio. 
 Commercial construction : Loans in this category include construction project financing and are comprised of commercial real estate, business banking and residential loans for the purpose of constructing and developing real estate. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had total commercial construction loans of 513.5 million and 387.0 million, respectively, representing 2.9 and 2.8 , respectively, of our total loans. Our commercial construction loan portfolio also includes loans included in our SNC Program portfolio described above. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, commercial construction loans in our SNC Program portfolio totaled 39.9 million and 10.2 million, respectively, or 7.8 and 2.6 respectively, of our commercial construction loan portfolio. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 100.0 of our commercial construction SNC Program portfolio were loans to borrowers headquartered in our primary lending market. Our commercial construction loan portfolio also included IRB loans of 114.0 million and 63.8 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, representing 22.2 and 16.5 respectively, of our commercial construction portfolio. 
 Business banking : Loans in this category are comprised of loans to small businesses with exposures of under 1.0 million and small investment real estate projects with exposures of under 3.0 million. These loans are separate and distinct from our commercial and industrial and commercial real estate portfolios described above due to the size of the loans. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had total business banking loans of 1.3 billion and 1.1 billion, respectively, representing 7.4 and 7.8 of our total loans for each period end, respectively. In this category, commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans totaled 239.4 million and 1.1 billion, respectively, as of September 30, 2024, and 186.9 million and 898.9 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2023. 
 Business banking originations include traditionally underwritten loans as well as partially automated scored loans. Our proprietary decision matrix, which includes a number of quantitative factors including, but not limited to, a guarantor s credit score, industry risk, and time in business, is used to determine whether to make business banking loans. We also engage in SBA lending. SBA guarantees reduce our risk of loss when default occurs and are considered a credit enhancement to the loan structure. 
 Residential Lending 
 Residential real estate : Loans in this category consist of mortgage loans on residential real estate. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had total residential real estate loans of 4.1 billion and 2.6 billion, respectively, representing 23.0 and 18.4 , respectively, of our total loans. Underwriting considerations include, among others, income sources and their reliability, willingness to repay as evidenced by credit repayment history, financial resources including cash reserves and the value of the collateral. We maintain policy standards for minimum credit scores and cash reserves and maximum loan-to-value consistent with a prime portfolio. Collateral consists of mortgage liens on residential dwellings. We do not originate or purchase sub-prime or other high-risk loans. Residential real estate loans are originated either for sale to investors or to retain in our loan portfolio. Decisions about whether to sell or retain residential real estate loans are made based on the interest rate characteristics, pricing for loans in the secondary mortgage market, competitive factors and our capital needs. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, residential real estate mortgage loan originations were 117.3 million and 244.9 million, respectively, of which 30.9 million and 65.7 million, respectively, were sold on the secondary markets. Comparatively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, residential real estate mortgage loan originations 
 71 

Table of Contents 

were 115.3 million and 253.0 million, respectively, of which 14.7 million and 36.6 million, respectively, were sold on the secondary markets. 
 Consumer Lending 
 Consumer home equity : Loans in this category consist of home equity lines of credit and home equity loans. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had total consumer home equity loans of 1.4 billion and 1.2 billion, respectively, representing 7.7 and 8.7 , respectively, of our total loans. Home equity lines of credit are granted for ten years with monthly interest-only repayment requirements. Full principal repayment is required at the end of the ten-year draw period. Home equity lines of credit can be converted to term loans that are fully amortized. Underwriting considerations are materially consistent with those utilized in the residential real estate category. Collateral consists of a senior or subordinate lien on owner-occupied residential property. 
 Other consumer : Loans in this category consist of unsecured personal lines of credit, overdraft protection, automobile and aircraft loans, home improvement loans and other personal loans. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had total other consumer loans of 271.8 million and 235.5 million, respectively, representing 1.5 and 1.7 , respectively, of our total loans. Our policy and underwriting in this category include the following factors, among others: income sources and reliability, credit histories, term of repayment and collateral value, as applicable. 
 Other Products and Services 
 In addition to our lending activities, which are the core part of our banking business, we offer other banking products and services primarily related to (i) other commercial banking products, (ii) other consumer deposit products and (iii) wealth management services. 
 Other Commercial Banking Products 
 We offer a variety of deposit, treasury management, electronic banking, interest rate protection and foreign exchange products to our customers. In addition, we offer cash management services to our corporate and municipal clients. Deposit products include checking products, both interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing, as well as money market deposits, savings deposits and certificates of deposits. Our treasury management products include a variety of cash management and payment products. Our interest rate protection and foreign exchange products include interest rate swaps and currency related transactions. 
 Other Consumer Deposit Products 
 We offer a wide variety of deposit products and services to our consumer customers. We service these customers through our 109 branches located in eastern Massachusetts and New Hampshire, through our call center in our facility in Lynn, MA and through our online and mobile banking applications. 
 Wealth Management Services 
 Through our Cambridge Trust Wealth Management division, we provide a wide range of trust services, including (i) managing customer investments, (ii) serving as custodian for customer assets, and (iii) providing other fiduciary services, including serving as the trustee and personal representative of estates. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we held 8.7 billion and 3.3 billion, respectively, of assets in a fiduciary, custodial or agency capacity for customers, which are not our assets and therefore not included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had noninterest income of 14.9 million and 28.2 million, respectively, from providing these services compared to 6.2 million and 18.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Outlook and Trends 
 Interest Rates 
 Beginning in March 2022, the Federal Open Market Committee FOMC voted to increase the federal funds rate multiple times from a range of 0.00 to 0.25 to a range of 5.25 to 5.50 on July 26, 2023, when the FOMC stated that it will continue to assess additional information and its implications for monetary policy. At its meeting on September 18, 2024, 
 72 

Table of Contents 

the FOMC decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points from the range set at its July 26, 2023 meeting to a range of 4.75 to 5.00 . At its most recent meeting on November 7, 2024, the FOMC again decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points from the range set at its September 18, 2024 meeting to a range of 4.50 to 4.75 and indicated, in considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, it will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The FOMC further indicated it is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and reducing the annual inflation rate to its 2 percent objective. 
 Inevitably, not all of our interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities will re-price simultaneously and in equal volume in response to changes in the federal funds rate, and therefore the potential for interest rate exposure exists. Management believes that several factors will affect the actual impact of interest rate changes on our balance sheet and operating results, including, but not limited to, actual changes in interest rates or expectations of future changes, the degree of volatility in the securities markets, inflation rates or expectations of inflation, and the slope of the interest rate yield curve. We attempt to manage interest rate risk by identifying, quantifying, and, where appropriate, hedging our exposure. Approximately 33 of the outstanding principal balance of our loans, gross of outstanding interest rate swaps as described further below, as of September 30, 2024 was indexed to a market rate that is expected to reprice with similar magnitude and direction as the federal funds rate. A portion of these loans have been hedged using interest rate swaps to convert the floating rate interest receipts to a fixed rate. The notional amount of floating rate loans swapped totaled 2.4 billion on September 30, 2024, representing approximately 13.3 of the outstanding principal balance of our loans at that date. For more detail regarding such hedging financial instruments, refer to Note 13, Derivative Financial Instruments within the Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Refer to the section titled Management of Market Risk within this Item 2 for additional discussion including the estimated change to our net interest income under interest rate risk measurement methodologies that use a variety of hypothetical scenarios assuming immediate and parallel changes in interest rates that may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We present certain non-GAAP financial measures, which management uses to evaluate our performance, and which exclude the effects of certain transactions, non-cash items and GAAP adjustments that we believe are unrelated to our core business and are therefore not necessarily indicative of our current performance or financial position. Management believes excluding these items facilitates greater visibility for investors into our core business as well as underlying trends that may, to some extent, be obscured by inclusion of such items in the corresponding GAAP financial measures. Except as otherwise indicated, the information presented for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 within this section excludes discontinued operations. Refer to Note 18, Discontinued Operations within the Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion regarding discontinued operations. 
 There are items in our financial statements that impact our results but which we believe are unrelated to our core business. Accordingly, we present operating net income, noninterest income on an operating basis, noninterest expense on an operating basis, total operating revenue, operating earnings per share, tangible net income to average tangible shareholders equity, tangible operating net income to average tangible shareholders' equity, tangible book value per share, and the operating efficiency ratio, each of which excludes the impact of such items because we believe such exclusion can provide greater visibility into our core business and underlying trends. Such items that we do not consider to be core to our business include (i) income and expenses from investments held in rabbi trusts, (ii) gains and losses on sales of securities available for sale, net, (iii) gains and losses on the sale of other assets, (iv) rabbi trust employee benefits expense, (v) impairment charges on tax credit investments and associated tax credit benefits, (vi) OREO gains and losses, (vii) merger and acquisition expenses, including the day-2 provision for allowance for loan losses for non-PCD acquired loans, and (viii) certain discrete tax items. There were no expenses indirectly associated with OREO gains or losses, or impairment charges on tax credit investments and associated tax credit benefits during the periods presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 We also present tangible shareholders equity, tangible assets, the ratio of tangible shareholders equity to tangible assets, average tangible shareholders equity, the ratios of tangible net (loss) income from continuing operations and tangible operating net income to average tangible shareholders equity and tangible book value per share, each of which excludes the impact of goodwill and other intangible assets, as we believe these financial measures provide investors with the ability to further assess our performance, identify trends in our core business and provide a comparison of our capital adequacy to other companies. We have included the tangible ratios because management believes that investors may find it useful to have access to the same analytical tools used by management to assess performance and identify trends. 
 In the third quarter of 2024, we changed our (loss) return on average tangible shareholders' equity and operating return on average tangible shareholders equity computations to utilize tangible net (loss) income from continuing operations and tangible operating net income, respectively, in the numerators of the computations. Tangible net (loss) income from continuing operations excludes the amortization of intangible assets and the related tax effect and tangible operating net income

Table of Contents 

excludes, in addition to the adjustments to derive operating net income, the amortization of intangible assets and related tax effect. In addition, in the third quarter of 2024, we changed the computation of our operating efficiency ratio to exclude, in addition to the adjustments made to operating net income, the amortization of intangible assets. Management believes the changes to such ratios result in a more meaningful measure of our financial performance and such measures are used by management when analyzing corporate performance. 
 Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative or substitute to GAAP net (loss) income, or as an indication of our cash flows from operating activities, a measure of our liquidity or an indication of funds available for our cash needs. An item which we consider to be non-core and exclude when computing these non-GAAP financial measures can be of substantial importance to our results for any particular period. In addition, our methodology for calculating non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the methodologies employed by other companies to calculate the same or similar performance measures and, accordingly, our reported non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to the same or similar performance measures reported by other companies. 
 The following table summarizes the impact of non-core items recorded for the time periods indicated below and reconciles them to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net income (loss) from continuing operations (GAAP) (6,188) 63,464 58,790 (94,198) Non-GAAP adjustments: Add: Provision for non-PCD acquired loans 40,899 40,899 Noninterest income components: (Income) loss from investments held in rabbi trusts (3,591) 1,523 (9,670) (4,336) Losses on sales of securities available for sale, net 7,557 333,170 Losses (gains) on sales of other assets 2,970 (2) 2,972 3 Noninterest expense components: Rabbi trust employee benefit expense (income) 1,326 (586) 4,002 2,002 Merger and acquisition expenses 27,577 3,630 33,077 3,630 Total impact of non-GAAP adjustments 69,181 4,565 78,837 334,469 Less net tax benefit associated with non-GAAP adjustment (1) 13,328 15,944 13,362 93,960 Non-GAAP adjustments, net of tax 55,853 (11,379) 65,475 240,509 Operating net income (non-GAAP) 49,665 52,085 124,265 146,311 Weighted average common shares outstanding during the period: Basic 196,700,222 162,370,469 174,398,692 162,199,158 Diluted 197,706,644 162,469,887 175,270,559 162,260,503 Earnings (losses) per share from continuing operations, basic (0.03) 0.39 0.34 (0.58) Earnings (losses) per share from continuing operations, diluted (0.03) 0.39 0.34 (0.58) Operating earnings per share, basic (non-GAAP) 0.25 0.32 0.71 0.90 Operating earnings per share, diluted (non-GAAP) 0.25 0.32 0.71 0.90 
 (1) The net tax benefit associated with these items is generally determined by assessing whether each item is included or excluded from net taxable income and applying our combined statutory tax rate only to those items included in net taxable income. The net tax benefit amount for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily resulted from the sale of securities classified as available for sale in the first quarter of 2023 and a 23.7 million tax benefit resulting from the transfer of certain securities from Market Street Securities Corp MSSC , a wholly owned subsidiary which was liquidated during the first quarter of 2023, to Eastern Bank, and the net effect of establishing a valuation allowance and the subsequent reversal of the federal portion of such valuation allowance. Upon the sale of securities in the first quarter of 2023, we established a valuation allowance of 17.4 million, which is included in the net tax benefit amount, as it was determined at that time that it was not more-likely-than-not that the entirety of the deferred tax asset related to the loss on such securities would be realized. Following the execution of the agreement to sell our insurance agency business

Table of Contents 

in September 2023 and our estimate of the resulting capital gain, we reversed the associated federal valuation allowance previously established as we had determined it was more-likely-than-not that the entirety of the federal deferred tax asset related to the loss on such securities would be realized. The net tax benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the reversal of the remainder of the federal portion of the valuation allowance described above and a net tax benefit associated with a change in management s estimate of annual pre-tax loss for purposes of determining our quarterly income tax provision. 
 The following table summarizes the impact of non-core items with respect to our total revenue, noninterest income (loss), noninterest expense, and the efficiency ratio, which reconciles to the most directly comparable respective GAAP financial measure, for the periods indicated:

 Cash and cash equivalents 
 Total cash and cash equivalents increased by 196.4 million, or 28.3 , to 889.5 million at September 30, 2024 from 693.1 million at December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily due to proceeds from the sale of AFS securities of 955.3 million and proceeds from maturities and principal paydowns of AFS and HTM securities of 305.5 million. Partially offsetting these increases were net repayments of FHLB advances of 763.0 million, which includes repayment of advances assumed in connection with our merger with Cambridge, a net decrease in deposits, excluding deposits acquired from Cambridge, of 253.1 million, and a net increase in gross loans, excluding loans acquired from Cambridge, of 156.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For further discussion of the change in securities, deposits, and loans, refer to the later Securities, Borrowings, Deposits, Loans, and Deposits, s ections in this Item 2. For further information regarding our merger with Cambridge, refer to Note 3, Mergers and Acquisitions within the Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Securities 
 Our current investment policy authorizes us to invest in various types of investment securities and liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of government-sponsored enterprises, mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, corporate notes, asset-backed securities and municipal securities. The Risk Management Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for approving and overseeing our investment policy, which it reviews at least annually. This policy dictates that investment decisions be made based on the safety of the investment, liquidity requirements, potential returns and market risk considerations. We do not engage in any investment hedging activities or trading activities, nor do we purchase any high-risk investment products. We typically invest in the following types of securities: 
 U.S. government securities: Our U.S. government securities consisted of U.S. Agency bonds and U.S. Treasury securities. We maintain these investments, to the extent appropriate, for liquidity purposes, at zero risk weighting for capital purposes, and as collateral for interest rate derivative positions. U.S. Agency bonds include securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the FHLB, and the Federal Farm Credit Bureau. 
 Mortgage-backed securities: We invest in residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities insured or guaranteed by Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae or Fannie Mae, including collateralized mortgage obligations. We have not purchased any privately-issued mortgage-backed securities. We invest in mortgage-backed securities to achieve a positive interest rate spread with minimal administrative expense, and to lower our credit risk as a result of the guarantees provided by Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae or Fannie Mae. 
 77 

Table of Contents 

Investments in mortgage-backed securities involve a risk that actual payments will be greater or less than the prepayment rate estimated at the time of purchase, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such interests, thereby affecting the net yield on our securities. We periodically review current prepayment speeds to determine whether prepayment estimates require modification that could cause amortization or accretion adjustments. There is also reinvestment risk associated with the cash flows from such securities. In addition, the market value of such securities may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. 
 State and municipal securities: We invest in fixed rate investment grade bonds issued primarily by municipalities in our local communities within Massachusetts and by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The market value of these securities may be affected by call options, long dated maturities, general market liquidity and credit factors. 
 The following table shows the fair value of our securities by investment category as of the dates indicated: 
 Securities Portfolio Composition

 Our securities portfolio decreased 0.3 billion, or 5.5 , to 4.6 billion at September 30, 2024 from 4.9 billion at December 31, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to maturities and principal paydowns of AFS and HTM securities of 305.5 million and sales of AFS securities of 955.3 million. Included in this activity are principal paydowns and proceeds from the sale of securities acquired in connection with our merger with Cambridge of 883.0 million, representing all of the securities acquired at fair value. All acquired securities paid down or were sold immediately following the completion of the merger. No gain or loss was recognized upon the sale as the securities were marked to fair value in connection with our purchase accounting based upon quoted sale prices. 
 We did not have trading investments at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 A portion of our securities portfolio continues to be tax-exempt. Investments in federally tax-exempt securities totaled 190.6 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 191.1 million at December 31, 2023. 
 Our AFS securities are carried at fair value and are categorized within the fair value hierarchy based on the observability of model inputs. Securities which require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no securities categorized as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.

 We consider our loan portfolio to be relatively diversified by borrower and industry. Our gross loans increased 4.1 billion, or 29.3 , to 18.1 billion at September 30, 2024 from 14.0 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to loans acquired in connection with our merger with Cambridge. Refer to Note 3, Mergers and Acquisitions within the Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional discussion. Excluding the addition of acquired loans, our gross loans increased 156.0 million, or 1.1 , which was primarily attributable to increased balances of business banking and consumer home equity loans. 
 Excluding Cambridge-acquired loans, our business banking portfolio increased by 115.0 million, or 10.6 , from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 which was primarily due to increased balances in our commercial real estate investment loan business banking category which reflects a continued focus by management on the growth of this portfolio. 
 Excluding Cambridge-acquired loans, our consumer home equity portfolio increased by 66.0 million, or 5.5 , from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 which was primarily due to additional draws by borrowers on home equity lines of credit. 
 We believe that our commercial loan portfolio composition is relatively diversified in terms of industry sectors, property types and various lending specialties, and it is concentrated in the New England geographical area, with 84.0 of our commercial loans in Massachusetts and New Hampshire as of September 30, 2024. 
 Asset quality. We continually monitor the asset quality of our loan portfolio utilizing portfolio scorecards and various credit quality indicators. Based on this process, loans meeting certain criteria are categorized as delinquent or non-performing and further assessed to determine if non-accrual status is appropriate. 
 For the commercial portfolio, which includes our commercial and industrial, commercial real estate, commercial construction and business banking loans, we monitor credit quality using a risk rating scale, which assigns a risk-grade to each borrower based on a number of quantitative and qualitative factors associated with a commercial loan transaction. Management utilizes a loan risk rating methodology based on a 15-point scale with the assistance of risk rating scorecard tools. Pass grades are 0-10 and non-pass categories, which align with regulatory guidelines, are: special mention (11), substandard (12), doubtful (13) and loss (14). 
 Risk rating assignment is determined using one of 15 separate scorecards developed for distinctive portfolio segments based on common attributes. Key factors include: industry and market conditions, position within the industry, earnings trends, operating cash flow, asset/liability values, debt capacity, guarantor strength, management and controls, financial reporting, collateral and other considerations. 
 Special mention, substandard and doubtful loans totaled 6.8 and 4.1 of total commercial loans outstanding at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. This increase was driven by several risk rating downgrades of loans in the commercial real estate and commercial and industrial portfolios.

Our philosophy toward managing our loan portfolios is predicated upon careful monitoring, which stresses early detection and response to delinquent and default situations. We seek to make arrangements to resolve any delinquent or default situation over the shortest possible time frame. 
 The delinquency rate of our total loan portfolio increased to 0.54 at September 30, 2024, compared to 0.41 at December 31, 2023. 
 The following table provides details regarding our delinquency rates as of the dates indicated: 
 Loan Delinquency Rates 
 Delinquency Rate as of September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Portfolio Commercial and industrial 0.13 Commercial real estate 0.34 Commercial construction 0.29 Business banking 0.85 0.58 Residential real estate 1.05 1.11 Consumer home equity 1.25 1.43 Other consumer 0.33 0.46 Total 0.54 0.41 
 As a general rule, loans more than 90 days past due with respect to principal or interest are classified as non-accrual loans. However, based on our assessment of collateral and/or payment prospects, certain loans that are more than 90 days past due may be kept on an accruing status. Income accruals are suspended on all non-accrual loans and all previously accrued and uncollected interest is reversed against current income. A loan is expected to remain on non-accrual status until it becomes current with respect to principal and interest, the loan is liquidated, or the loan is determined to be uncollectible and is charged-off against the allowance for loan losses. 
 Non-performing assets NPAs are comprised of non-performing loans NPLs ), OREO and non-performing securities. NPLs consist of non-accrual loans and loans that are more than 90 days past due but still accruing interest. OREO consists of real estate properties, which primarily serve as collateral to secure our loans, that we control due to foreclosure. These properties are recorded at the fair value less estimated costs to sell on the date we obtain control. Any write-downs to the cost of the related asset upon transfer to OREO to reflect the asset at fair value less estimated costs to sell is recorded through the allowance for loan losses. 
 NPLs increased 71.9 million, or 136.9 , to 124.5 million at September 30, 2024 from 52.6 million at December 31, 2023. NPLs as a percentage of total loans increased to 0.70 at September 30, 2024 from 0.38 at December 31, 2023. Refer to the later Allowance for Loan Losses section in this Item 2 for a discussion of the change in non-accrual loans which comprise our NPLs as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 The total amount of interest recorded on NPLs during both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was not significant. The gross interest income that would have been recorded under the original terms of those loans if they had

Table of Contents 

been performing amounted to 2.9 million and 3.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 In the course of resolving NPLs, we may choose to restructure the contractual terms of certain loans. We attempt to work-out alternative payment schedules with the borrowers in order to avoid foreclosure actions. The aggregate amortized cost balance as of September 30, 2024 of loans modified during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 which were determined to be modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty was 13.2 million and 33.4 million, respectively. Included in such modifications during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were four commercial real estate loans collateralized by properties in our office risk segment, one of which was modified during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The aggregate amortized cost balance as of September 30, 2023 of loans modified during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 which were determined to be modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty was 2.9 million and 7.0 million, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024, there were two loans with an aggregate balance of 0.3 million that had been modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty during the during the twelve-month period then ended which had subsequently defaulted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2023, there were no loans that had been modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty during the nine-month period then ended which had subsequently defaulted during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Our policy is that any restructured loan, which is on non-accrual status prior to being modified, remain on non-accrual status for approximately six months subsequent to being modified before we consider its return to accrual status. If the restructured loan is on accrual status prior to being modified, we review it to determine if the modified loan should remain on accrual status. 
 Purchased credit deteriorated PCD loans are loans that we acquired that have shown evidence of deterioration of credit quality since origination and, therefore, it was deemed unlikely that all contractually required payments would be collected upon the merger date. We consider factors such as payment history, collateral values and accrual status when determining whether there was evidence of deterioration at the merger date. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying amount of PCD loans was 373.8 million and 49.1 million, respectively. The increase in PCD loans was due to our acquisition of PCD loans during the three months ended September 30, 2024 in connection with our merger with Cambridge which was completed on July 12, 2024 and added 356.1 million in PCD loans on a gross amortized cost basis. 
 Potential Problem Loans. In the normal course of business, we become aware of possible credit problems in which borrowers exhibit the potential to be unable to comply in the future with the contractual terms of their loans, but which currently do not yet meet the criteria for classification as NPLs. These loans are neither delinquent nor on non-accrual status. Our potential problem loans, or loans with potential weaknesses that were not included in the non-accrual loans or in the loans 90 or more past due categories, increased by 183.2 million, or 49.0 , to 556.9 million at September 30, 2024 from 373.7 million at December 31, 2023. These loans as a percentage of total loans increased to 3.1 at September 30, 2024 from 2.7 at December 31, 2023. The increase in potential problem loans from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the downgrade of certain commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, including certain commercial real estate loans collateralized by properties in the office risk segment, and the addition of certain loans acquired in connection with our merger with Cambridge. Refer to the below Commercial Real Estate Office Exposure section of this Item 2 for additional information. 
 Commercial Real Estate Office Exposure. Our total office-related commercial real estate CRE loans (which is comprised of loans within our commercial real estate and construction portfolios that are secured by office space, medical office space, and mixed-use properties where rental income is primarily from office space) totaled 1.1 billion and 818.9 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, of which 277.6 million was acquired in connection with our merger with Cambridge. As of September 30, 2024, our office-related CRE loans are primarily concentrated in Massachusetts, where approximately 91.7 of the total recorded investment balance of office-related CRE loans are located, and approximately 22.1 of the total recorded investment balance of office-related CRE loans are located in the City of Boston. 
 Given prevailing market conditions such as reduced occupancy as a result of the increase in hybrid and fully remote work arrangements post-COVID and lower commercial real estate valuations, we are carefully monitoring these loans for signs of deterioration in credit quality. Such monitoring includes incremental risk management strategies undertaken by management including monthly internal CRE office exposure portfolio reporting, more frequent portfolio reviews, ongoing monitoring of market conditions, and additional portfolio analysis such as maturity risk analysis and rent rollover risk analysis. As of September 30, 2024, nine of these loans, which had a total recorded investment balance of 77.0 million, were on non-accrual status. We recorded a partial charge-off of 7.3 million of the commercial real estate loan which transitioned to non-accrual during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, two of these loans were on non-accrual status and had a total recorded investment balance of 14.0 million.

 Allowance for credit losses. For the purpose of estimating our allowance for loan losses, we segregate the loan portfolio into loan categories, for loans that share similar risk characteristics, that possess unique risk characteristics such as loan purpose, repayment source, and collateral that are considered when determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses for each category. Loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with other loans are evaluated individually. 
 While we use available information to recognize losses on loans, future additions or subtractions to/from the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in NPLs, changes in economic conditions, or other reasons. Additionally, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of our examination process, periodically assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses to assess whether the allowance for loan losses was determined in accordance with GAAP and applicable guidance. 
 We perform an evaluation of our allowance for loan losses on a regular basis (at least quarterly), and establish the allowance for loan losses based upon an evaluation of our loan categories, as each possesses unique risk characteristics that are considered when determining the appropriate level of allowance for loan losses, including: 
 known increases in concentrations within each category; 
 83 

Table of Contents 

certain higher risk classes of loans, or pledged collateral; 
 historical loan loss experience within each category; 
 results of any independent review and evaluation of the category s credit quality; 
 trends in volume, maturity and composition of each category; 
 volume and trends in delinquencies and non-accruals; 
 national and local economic conditions and downturns in specific local industries; 
 corporate goals and objectives; 
 lending policies and procedures, including underwriting standards and collection, charge-off and recovery practices; and 
 current and forecasted banking industry conditions, as well as the regulatory and competitive environment. 
 Loans are evaluated on a regular basis by management. Expected lifetime losses are estimated on a collective basis for loans sharing similar risk characteristics and are determined using a quantitative model combined with an assessment of certain qualitative factors designed to address forecast risk and model risk inherent in the quantitative model output. For commercial and industrial, commercial real estate, commercial construction and business banking portfolios, the quantitative model uses a loan rating system which is comprised of management s determination of probability of default, or PD, loss given default, or LGD, and exposure at default, or EAD, which are derived from historical loss experience and other factors. For residential real estate, consumer home equity and other consumer portfolios, our quantitative model uses historical loss experience. 
 The allowance for loan losses is allocated to loan categories using both a formula-based approach and an analysis of certain individual loans for impairment. We use a methodology to systematically estimate the amount of expected credit loss in the loan portfolio. Under our current methodology, the allowance for loan losses contains reserves related to loans for which the related allowance for loan losses is determined on an individual loan basis and on a collective basis, and other qualitative components. 
 The allowance for loan losses increased by 104.8 million, or 70.4 , to 253.8 million, or 1.43 of total loans, at September 30, 2024 from 149.0 million, or 1.07 of total loans at December 31, 2023. The increase in the allowance for loan losses was primarily due to our merger with Cambridge, which was completed on July 12, 2024. In connection with the merger, we recorded an allowance for acquired PCD loans of 55.8 million, as a gross-up of the corresponding loan balance, and a day-2 allowance for acquired non-PCD loans of 40.9 million, recognized through the provision for allowance for loan losses. Excluding these amounts, the allowance for loan losses increased by 8.1 million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. Management determined a provision to be necessary for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to 11.8 million in charge-offs of commercial real estate loans including one commercial real estate loan, of which 7.3 million was partially charged-off, collateralized by a property in the office risk segment which transitioned to non-accrual status during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and had not been previously reserved for on a specific reserve basis, and due to an increase in specific reserves for commercial real estate loans collateralized by a property in the office risk segment. 
 In the ordinary course of business, we enter into commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Such financial instruments are recorded in the financial statements when they become payable. The credit risk associated with these commitments is evaluated in a manner similar to the reserving method for loans receivable previously described. The reserve for unfunded lending commitments is included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our reserve for unfunded lending commitments decreased by 0.1 million, or 0.7 , to 14.0 million at September 30, 2024 from 14.1 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower reserve rates and unfunded balances within the commercial construction portfolio, which were attributable to an improved economic forecast and draws by borrowers which served to reduce unfunded balances. The decrease in our reserve for unfunded lending commitments contributed to a decrease in our other non-interest expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 For additional discussion of the change in allowance for loan losses, refer to the later Provision for Loan Losses , included in the Results of Operations section within this Item 2.

Non-accrual loans increased 77.0 million, or 162.3 , to 124.5 million at September 30, 2024 from 47.5 million at September 30, 2023, primarily due to loans acquired from Cambridge and which were already on non-accrual or were transferred to non-accrual following the completion of the merger. As of September 30, 2024, the amount of loans on non-accrual which were acquired from Cambridge was 79.3 million. For additional information regarding the credit quality of our loans, see Note 5, Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses within the Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 The following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan categories listed in loan portfolio composition as of the dates indicated:

 To determine if a loan should be charged-off, all possible sources of repayment are analyzed. Possible sources of repayment include the potential for future cash flows, liquidation of the collateral and the strength of co-makers or guarantors. When available information confirms that specific loans or portions thereof are uncollectible, these amounts are promptly charged-off against the allowance for loan losses and any recoveries of such previously charged-off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan losses. 
 Regardless of whether a loan is unsecured or collateralized, we charge off the amount of any confirmed loan loss in the period when the loans, or portions of loans, are deemed uncollectible. For troubled, collateral-dependent loans, loss confirming events may include an appraisal or other valuation that reflects a shortfall between the value of the collateral and the carrying value of the loan or receivable, or a deficiency balance following the sale of the collateral. 
 For additional information regarding our allowance for loan losses, see Note 5, Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses within the Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Federal Home Loan Bank stock 
 The FHLBB is a cooperative that provides services to its member banking institutions. The primary reason for our membership in the FHLBB is to gain access to a reliable source of wholesale funding and as a tool to manage interest rate risk. The purchase of stock in the FHLB is a requirement for a member to gain access to funding. We purchase and/or are subject to redemption of FHLBB stock proportional to the volume of funding received and view the holdings as a necessary long-term investment for the purpose of balance sheet liquidity and not for investment return. 
 We held an investment in the FHLBB of 5.9 million at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The amount of stock we are required to purchase is proportional to our FHLB borrowings and level of total assets. 
 Goodwill and other intangible assets

Table of Contents 

The table below sets forth the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, as of the dates indicated below:

 The balance of our goodwill and core deposit intangible asset was 1.1 billion and 566.2 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The increase in goodwill and other intangible assets at September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023 was due to our merger with Cambridge during the third quarter of 2024. Refer to Note 3, Mergers and Acquisitions within the Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional discussion. We did not record any impairment to our goodwill or other intangible assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Deposits 
 Deposits originating within the markets we serve continue to be our primary source of funding our earning assets. Historically, we have been able to compete effectively for deposits in our primary market areas. The distribution and market share of deposits by type of deposit and type of depositor are important considerations in our assessment of the stability of our funding sources and our access to additional funds. Furthermore, we shift the mix and maturity of the deposits depending on economic conditions and loan and investment policies in an attempt, within set policies, to minimize cost and maximize net interest margin. 
 The following table presents our deposits as of the dates presented: 
 Components of Deposits

 Deposits increased by 3.6 billion, or 20.6 , to 21.2 billion at September 30, 2024 from 17.6 billion at December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily due to the addition of deposits acquired in connection with our merger with Cambridge, which was completed on July 12, 2024. Excluding the acquired deposit balances, deposits decreased 253.1 million, or 1.4 , at September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023. This decrease was primarily driven by an early termination of an omnibus deposit contract which totaled 100.0 million and which contributed to the decrease in interest checking deposits at September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023, excluding the impact of our merger with Cambridge. Further, the remaining changes, which taken together comprise an overall decrease, reflect organic deposit runoff and a continued shift in deposit mix from non-interest-bearing deposit accounts to interest-bearing deposit accounts during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The shift in deposit mix was due primarily to increases in rates paid on money market investment deposits and certificates of deposit, which attracted depositors to such products.

The Bank s estimate of total uninsured deposits was 9.0 billion and 8.0 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In accordance with the FDIC s Call Report instructions, these estimates include accounts of wholly-owned subsidiaries, the holding company, and internal operating deposit accounts (together referred to as internal deposit accounts ). In addition, these estimates include municipal deposit accounts for which securities were pledged by us to secure such deposits collateralized deposits ). For liquidity monitoring purposes, we exclude internal deposit accounts and collateralized deposits from our estimate of uninsured deposits. Our estimate of uninsured deposits, excluding internal deposit accounts and collateralized deposits, was 6.7 billion and 5.5 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 The following table presents the classification of deposits on an average basis for the periods below:

 Borrowings 
 Our borrowings consist of both short-term and long-term borrowings and provide us with sources of funding. Maintaining available borrowing capacity provides us with a contingent source of liquidity. The following table sets forth the balances on our borrowings as of the dates and for the periods indicated:

 Our total borrowings increased by 22.6 million to 70.8 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 48.2 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased balances of interest rate swap collateral funds. Refer to the later Liquidity, Capital Resources, Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies section in this Item 2 for additional discussion of our liquidity position.

 Comparison of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Interest and Dividend Income 
 Interest and dividend income increased by 63.9 million, or 31.6 , to 266.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 202.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to an increase in the average balance and yields of our loan portfolio. The average balance of our loan portfolio increased 3.3 billion, or 24.0 , to 17.3 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The overall yield on our loans increased 48 basis points during the three months ended September 30, 2024 in comparison to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our yields on loans and securities are generally presented on an FTE basis where the embedded tax benefit on loans and securities are calculated and added to the yield. Management believes that this presentation allows for better comparability between institutions with different tax structures. 
 Interest income on loans increased 61.6 million, or 36.4 , to 230.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 169.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest income on our loans was due to an increase in both the average balance and yield of such loans. The average balance of our loan portfolio increased 3.3 billion, or 24.0 , to 17.3 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 13.9 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was primarily due to loans acquired in connection with our merger with Cambridge of 3.7 billion. The overall yield on our loans increased 48 basis points during the three months ended September 30, 2024 in comparison to the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was primarily due to the accretion of the discount recorded related to loans acquired in our merger with Cambridge. Also contributing to the increase in overall loan yields were increases in market rates of interest which resulted in increased yields on variable rate loans which repriced, and new loans originated at higher rates of interest. 
 Interest income on securities and other short-term investments increased by 2.3 million, or 7.0 , to 35.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 32.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in our average cash balance included in other short-term investments, which was primarily due to an increase in our cash held at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston FRBB from 523.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 812.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. This increase was primarily driven by the deposit of cash received from principal paydowns and the subsequent sale of securities acquired in connection with our merger with Cambridge, the proceeds from which totaled 883.0 million. Also contributing to the increase was an increase in our combined yield on our securities and other short-term investments, which increased 21 basis points during the three months ended September 30, 2024 in comparison to the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to an increase of cash held at the FRBB discussed above.

Interest and dividend income increased by 83.2 million, or 14.0 , to 676.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 592.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to an increase in our average balance of our loan portfolio and our yields. The average balance of loans increased 1.4 billion, or 9.8 , to 15.1 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The overall yield on our loans increased 37 basis points during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 in comparison to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest income on loans increased 89.6 million, or 18.5 , to 573.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 483.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest income on our loans was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of our loans and an increase in the yield on our loans. The average balance of our loan portfolio increased 1.4 billion, or 9.8 , to 15.1 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was primarily due to loans acquired in connection with our merger with Cambridge of 3.7 billion. The overall yield on our loans increased 37 basis points during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 in comparison to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in yield was primarily due to increases in market rates of interest which resulted in increased yields on variable rate loans which repriced, and new loans originated at higher rates of interest. Also contributing to the increase in yield was the accretion of the discount received on our loans acquired in our merger with Cambridge. 
 Interest income on securities and other short-term investments decreased by 6.5 million, or 5.9 , to 102.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 109.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in the average balance of our securities and other short-term investments, which decreased 1.0 billion, or 13.8 , to 6.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 7.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was primarily due to our sales of AFS securities in May 2024 and maturities and principal paydowns on AFS and HTM securities. Partially offsetting the decrease in the average balance of our securities and other short-term investments, and contributing to the overall increase in interest income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was an increase in our yield on our securities and other short-term investments which increased 19 basis points during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 in comparison to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase in the rate paid on our cash held at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston from an average of 4.99 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to an average of 5.38 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Interest Expense 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense increased 31.2 million and 71.9 million, respectively, to 96.2 million and 247.6 million, respectively, from 65.0 million and 175.7 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. These increases were primarily attributable to an increase in deposit interest expense partially offset by a decrease in borrowings interest expense. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense on our interest-bearing deposits increased by 35.7 million to 95.3 million from 59.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was due to an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits. Also contributing to the increase was an increase in the rates paid on deposits. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, average interest-bearing deposits increased by 2.7 billion, or 21.3 , to 15.2 billion from 12.5 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily as a result of our merger with Cambridge which added approximately 2.9 billion in interest-bearing deposits. Rates paid on deposits increased by 61 basis points to 2.50 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.89 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily due to our increasing overall deposit rates paid in response to an increase in market rates of interest and heightened industry-wide competition for deposits, as well as a shift in deposit mix from lower interest-bearing account types to higher interest-bearing account types. 
 Interest expense related to our borrowings decreased by 4.5 million to 0.8 million during three months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in borrowings interest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was due to a decrease in our utilization of our FHLB borrowing capacity. Our utilization of FHLBB borrowings was greater during the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024 as we had bolstered our on-balance sheet liquidity in response to the bank failures in the first quarter of 2023. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2023, we paid down our FHLB advances primarily with the proceeds from the sale of our insurance agency business, which also occurred in the fourth quarter of 2023. Both of these factors resulted in a reduced average balance of borrowings during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense on our interest-bearing deposits increased by 87.6 million to 246.3 million from 158.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was due 
 90 

Table of Contents 

to an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits. Also contributing to the increase was an increase in rates paid on deposits. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, average interest-bearing deposits increased 0.6 billion, or 5.0 , to 13.6 billion, from 12.9 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily as a result of our merger with Cambridge which added approximately 2.9 billion in interest-bearing deposits. Rates paid on deposits increased by 79 basis points to 2.43 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.64 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily due to our increasing overall deposit rates paid in response to an increase in market rates of interest and heightened industry-wide competition for deposits, as well as a shift in deposit mix from lower interest-bearing account types to higher interest-bearing account types. 
 Interest expense related to our borrowings decreased by 15.7 million to 1.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 17.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in borrowings interest expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to a decrease in our utilization of our FHLB borrowing capacity. Our utilization of FHLBB borrowings was greater during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as we had bolstered our on-balance sheet liquidity in response to the bank failures in the first quarter of 2023. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2023, we paid down our FHLB advances primarily with the proceeds from the sale of our insurance agency business, which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2023. Both of these factors resulted in a reduced average balance of borrowings during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income increased by 32.7 million, or 23.8 , to 169.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 137.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net interest income increased due to an increase in our net interest margin as well as an increase in the average balance of net interest-earning assets of 0.8 billion, or 11.6 , to 8.2 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 7.3 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net interest income increased by 11.3 million, or 2.7 , to 428.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 417.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net interest income increased due to an increase in the average balance of net interest-earning assets of 0.1 billion, or 1.7 , to 7.7 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 7.6 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as well as an increase in our net interest margin during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The following chart shows our net interest margin over the past five quarters:

Table of Contents 

Net interest margin is determined by dividing FTE net interest income by average total interest-earning assets. For purposes of the following discussion, income from tax-exempt loans and investment securities has been adjusted to an FTE basis, using marginal tax rates of 21.8 and 21.7 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 21.7 for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net interest margin increased 19 basis points during the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 2.97 from 2.77 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net interest margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to an increase in our average yield on interest-earning assets which exceeded the increase in the average cost of our interest-earning liabilities. 
 Net interest margin increased 3 basis points to 2.77 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.74 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net interest margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to an increase in our average yield on interest-earning assets which exceeded the increase in the average cost of our interest-earning liabilities.

 The following chart shows the composition of our quarterly average interest-earning assets for the past five quarters: 
 
 Provision for Loan Losses 
 The provision for loan losses represents the charge to expense that is required to maintain an appropriate level of allowance for loan losses. 
 We recorded a provision for allowance for loan losses of 47.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a provision of 7.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and a provision for allowance for loan losses of 60.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a provision of 14.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a day-2 provision for allowance for loan losses of 40.9 million related to non-PCD loans acquired in connection with our merger with Cambridge which closed on July 12, 2024. Excluding this amount, the provision for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 6.1 million and 19.7 million, respectively. Management determined a provision to be necessary for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to increased specific reserves for commercial real estate loans collateralized by a property in the office risk segment. Management determined a provision to be necessary for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to 11.8 million in charge-offs of commercial real estate loans including one commercial real estate loan, of which 7.3 million was partially charged-off, collateralized by a property in the office risk segment which transitioned to non-accrual status during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and had not been previously reserved for on a specific reserve basis, and due to an increase in specific reserves for commercial real estate loans collateralized by a property in the office risk segment. 
 Our periodic evaluation of the appropriate allowance for loan losses considers the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions, and trends in loan delinquencies and charge-offs. 
 Management s estimate of our allowance for loan losses as of September 30, 2024 and the provision for allowance for loan losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was supported, in part, by Oxford Economics September 2024 Baseline forecast the forecast which was used to develop management s estimate of the effect of expected future economic conditions on the allowance for loan losses. The forecast assumed the U.S. economy will remain steady throughout the remainder of 2024 and will continue to normalize with a slight decrease next year as U.S. gross domestic product GDP growth will decrease. This forecast reflects the impact of steady consumer spending but an increase in the

Table of Contents 

unemployment rate. Primary macroeconomic assumptions included in management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses included a rise in the unemployment rate and a slight decline in U.S. GDP that is projected to remain steady through the end of 2024 and decrease slightly in 2025. Further, the forecast assumed that the FOMC will decrease federal funds rates multiple times in 2025. Refer to the section titled Outlook and Trends within this Item 2 for additional discussion. For additional discussion of our allowance for credit losses measurement methodology, see Note 5, Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses within the Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 To illustrate the sensitivity of the modeled result to the impact of a hypothetical change in the economic forecast, management calculated the allowance for loan losses assuming the downside economic forecast scenario and, separately, the upside economic forecast scenario. The downside scenario assumed the U.S. economy will experience growth of GDP on an annual basis in 2024 of 2.2 . Use of the downside scenario would have resulted in an incremental increase in the allowance for loan losses of approximately 18.3 million as of September 30, 2024. The upside scenario assumed GDP growth on an annual basis of 2.7 , along with sustained recovery. Use of the upside scenario would have resulted in an incremental decrease in the allowance for loan losses of approximately 7.6 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 Our periodic evaluation of the appropriate allowance for loan losses considers the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions, and trends in loan delinquencies and charge-offs. 
 Noninterest Income 
 The following table sets forth information regarding noninterest income for the periods shown:

 Noninterest income increased 14.4 million, or 75.0 , to 33.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 19.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to an 8.7 million increase in trust and investment advisory fees, an 5.1 million increase in income from investments held in rabbi trusts, and a 2.7 million decrease in losses on sales of commercial and industrial loans. These increases were partially offset by a 1.9 million decrease in other noninterest income. 
 Trust and investment advisory fees increased due to an increase in our assets under management, which increased due to our merger with Cambridge through which we acquired 5.0 billion in assets held in a fiduciary, custodial or agency capacity for customers. 
 Income from investments held in rabbi trusts increased primarily as a result of a favorable mark-to-market adjustment on equity securities held in those accounts for the three months ended September 30, 2024 resulting from an increase in the market value of equity securities held in the rabbi trusts as compared to an unfavorable mark-to-market adjustment for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Loss on sale of commercial loans decreased as no commercial loans were sold during the three months ended September 30, 2024. We realized a loss on sale of commercial and industrial loans of 2.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Management made the decision to sell a portion of our commercial 
 96 

Table of Contents 

and industrial loans included in the SNC Program in order to fund new loan originations and to provide additional liquidity to support ongoing operations. 
 Other noninterest income decreased primarily as a result of write-offs of certain property and equipment during the three months ended September 30, 2024 which was associated with our merger with Cambridge. 
 Noninterest income increased 351.1 million, or 132.7 , to 86.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from a net loss of 264.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to a 325.6 million decrease in losses on sales of securities available for sale, an 10.0 million increase in trust and investment advisory fees, an 5.3 million increase in income from investments held in rabbi trusts, and an 5.2 million increase in other noninterest income. 
 We recorded losses of 7.6 million and 333.2 million on sales of securities available for sale, net, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In May 2024, an early withdrawal of an omnibus deposit contract occurred which had a balance of 100.0 million at the time of the contract termination. Management made the decision to sell certain available for sale securities following the early termination in order to recoup liquidity. We recorded losses during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as management made the decision to sell certain available for sale securities in connection with a balance sheet repositioning in March 2023. In July 2024, following our merger with Cambridge, we sold all securities that we had acquired through the merger. However, such securities had been adjusted to fair value in connection with our merger purchase accounting based upon the quoted sale price. As such, no gain or loss was recognized from the sale of such securities. 
 Income from investments held in rabbi trusts increased primarily as a result of a more favorable mark-to-market adjustment on equity securities held in those accounts for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulting from an increase in the market value of equity securities held in the rabbi trusts. 
 Trust and investment advisory fees increased due to an increase in our assets under management, which increased due to an increase in our wealth management and trust operations as a result of our merger with Cambridge through which we acquired 5.0 billion in assets held in a fiduciary, custodial or agency capacity for customers. 
 Other noninterest income increased primarily as a result of 7.8 million of fee income received as a result of the early withdrawal of an omnibus deposit contract which had a balance of 100.0 million, as described above. This increase was partially offset by write-offs of certain property and equipment during the three months ended September 30, 2024, which was associated with our merger with Cambridge.

 Noninterest expense increased by 58.0 million, or 57.0 , to 159.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 101.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased merger and acquisition expenses of 24.0 million, and the following items which exclude merger and acquisition expenses: an 19.7 million increase in salaries and employee benefits expense, an 5.7 million increase in amortization of intangible assets, an 4.7 million increase in data processing, and an 3.2 million increase in office occupancy and equipment. 
 Salaries and employee benefits, excluding merger and acquisitions expenses, increased primarily due to an increase in salaries and wages expense, an increase in incentives, an increase in share based compensation, an increase in benefit expense related to our defined contribution supplemental executive retirement plan DC SERP ), and an increase in Federal Insurance Contributions Act FICA expense. 
 Salaries and wages expense, excluding merger and acquisition expenses, increased 9.0 million primarily due to an increase in the number of employees as a result of our merger with Cambridge. 
 Incentives, excluding merger and acquisition expenses, increased 2.9 million primarily due to an increase in the number employees as a result of our merger with Cambridge. 
 Share-based compensation, excluding merger and acquisition expenses, increased due to an increase in the number of employees in the 2021 Plan , which was the result of our merger with Cambridge, as well as additional restricted stock awards granted to two new executives who were hired during the three months ended September 30, 2024, one of which was a former Cambridge employee retained following the merger. 
 For our DC SERP, participant benefits are adjusted based upon deemed investment performance. Accordingly, such investments experienced an increase in value during the three months ended September 30, 2024, resulting in a corresponding increase in the related benefit expense. 
 FICA expense, excluding merger and acquisition expenses, increased primarily due to an increase in the number of employees which was primarily driven by our merger with Cambridge. 
 Amortization of intangible assets increased primarily as a result of an increase in intangible assets resulting from our merger with Cambridge which led to a corresponding increase in amortization expense. 
 Data processing expenses, excluding merger and acquisition expenses, increased primarily as a result of an increase in software expenses, which was primarily driven by increases in our cybersecurity software expenses, which was in an effort to increase our cybersecurity technology to better protect against cybersecurity threats.. 
 Office occupancy and equipment, excluding merger and acquisition expenses, increased primarily due to the additional properties acquired in our merger with Cambridge which led to an 1.1 million increase in depreciation expense, and an 0.8 million increase in real estate operating lease expense.

 (1) We recorded merger and acquisition expenses of 33.1 million and 3.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to our merger with Cambridge. These columns display the period-over-period change in merger and acquisition expenses by financial statement line item and the change in account balances excluding such amounts. 
 Noninterest expense increased by 73.3 million, or 24.6 , to 370.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 297.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to increased merger and acquisition expenses of 29.5 million, and the following items, which exclude merger and acquisition expenses: an 24.7 million increase in salaries and employee benefits, an 11.0 million increase in data processing, an 5.9 million increase in amortization of intangible assets, and an 4.3 million increase in office occupancy and equipment. These increases were partially offset by a 3.6 million decrease in other noninterest expenses. 
 Salaries and employee benefits expenses increased primarily due to an increase in salaries and wages expense, an increase in incentives, an increase in share-based compensation, an increase in DC SERP expense, and an increase in FICA expense. 
 Salaries and wages expense, excluding merger and acquisition expenses, increased 11.3 million primarily due to an increase in the number of employees as a result of our merger with Cambridge. 
 Incentives, excluding merger and acquisition expenses, increased 2.8 million primarily due to an increase in the number employees as a result of our merger with Cambridge. 
 Share-based compensation, excluding acquisition and merger expenses, increased due to an increase in the number of employees in the 2021 Equity Plan , which was the result of our merger with Cambridge, as well as additional restricted stock awards granted to two new executives who were hired during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 For our DC SERP, participant benefits are adjusted based upon deemed investment performance. Such investments experienced an increase in value during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, therefore resulting in a corresponding increase in the related benefit expense. 
 FICA expense, excluding merger and acquisition expenses, increased primarily due to an increase in the number of employees, which was primarily driven by our merger with Cambridge. 
 Data processing, excluding merger and acquisition expenses, increased primarily as a result of an increase in software expenses, which were primarily driven by an increase cybersecurity software expenses. The increase in these expenses was driven by efforts to improve our improve our cybersecurity technology to better protect against cybersecurity threats. 
 Amortization of intangible assets increased primarily due to an increase in intangible assets in connection with our merger with Cambridge, resulting in a corresponding increase in amortization expense. 
 Office occupancy and equipment, excluding merger and acquisition expenses, increased primarily due to the addition of properties resulting from our merger with Cambridge and was the primary driver for an increase in real estate operating lease expense, and an increase in depreciation expense. 
 Other noninterest expenses, excluding merger and acquisition expenses, decreased primarily due to a 3.8 million decrease in the provision for credit losses on off-balance sheet exposures, which was caused by a reduction in reserve rates and balances in commercial construction unfunded commitments. For further discussion of the change in the provision for credit losses on off-balance sheet exposures, refer to the earlier discussion under Allowance for Credit Losses, included in the Financial Position section within this Item

2. Partially offsetting this decrease was a 2.1 million increase in post retirement bank owned life insurance expense which was primarily caused by a decrease in the discount rate used to determine the liability related to our split-dollar life insurance policies. This decrease in the discount rate resulted in an increase in the expense associated with such liabilities. 
 Income Taxes 
 We recognize the tax effect of all income and expense transactions in each year s Consolidated Statements of Income, regardless of the year in which the transactions are reported for income tax purposes. The following table sets forth information regarding our tax provision and applicable tax rates for the periods indicated and excludes income tax expense related to discontinued operations: 
 Tax Provision and Applicable Tax Rates 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (Dollars in thousands) Combined federal and state income tax provision (benefit) 2,835 (16,178) 24,798 (65,619) Effective income tax rate (84.6) (34.2) 29.7 41.1 Blended statutory tax rate 27.7 28.2 27.7 28.2 
 Income tax expense increased by 19.0 million to 2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from a net income tax benefit of 16.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase to net expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the establishment of a 6.3 million valuation allowance in the third quarter of 2024 for the anticipated lost state tax benefit associated with the projected 2024 Massachusetts state tax net operating loss which cannot be carried over. The state tax net operating losses were due to the tax losses incurred as a result of the liquidation of the securities acquired in connection with our merger with Cambridge. 
 The increase in income tax expense from a net benefit of 65.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to a net expense of 24.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to pre-tax losses resulting from losses on sales of available for sale securities in the first quarter of 2023 and the establishment of a valuation allowance in the third quarter of 2024 described above. 
 During the first quarter of 2023, we liquidated Market Street Securities Corporation MSSC ), a wholly owned subsidiary, and transferred all of MSSC s assets to Eastern Bank. In connection with the liquidation and subsequent transfer of securities previously held by MSSC to Eastern Bank, the Company recognized an additional deferred income tax benefit of 23.7 million during the first quarter of 2023. This deferred income tax benefit resulted from a state tax rate change applied to the deferred tax asset related to the securities transferred to Eastern Bank. 
 Refer to Note 10, Income Taxes for further discussion regarding income taxes. 
 
 Management of Market Risk 
 General. Market risk is the sensitivity of the net present value of assets and liabilities and/or income to changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and other market-driven rates or prices. Interest rate sensitivity is the most significant market risk to which we are exposed. Interest rate risk is the sensitivity of the net present value of assets and liabilities and income to changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates, as well as fluctuations in the level and duration of assets and liabilities, affect net interest income, our primary source of income. Interest rate risk arises directly from our core banking activities. In addition to directly impacting net interest income, changes in the level of interest rates can also affect the amount of loans originated, the timing of cash flows on loans and securities, and the fair value of assets and liabilities, as well as other aspects of our business. 
 Governance. The primary goal of interest rate risk management is to attempt to control this risk within policy limits approved by the Risk Management Committee of our Board of Directors RMC ), and within the Risk Appetite Statement formally adopted by the Board of Directors and described further below. 
 These limits reflect our tolerance for interest rate risk over both short-term and long-term horizons, are designed to encompass market rate shocks that would take place with both gradual and immediate effect and cover a range of scenarios from mild to extreme market shocks. More specifically, and as further described below, our policy limits govern: 
 The maximum amount of acceptable earnings loss due to market risk in year one of a two-year earnings simulation, determined by net interest income analysis; 
 100 

Table of Contents 

The maximum amount of acceptable earnings loss due to market risk in year two of a two-year earnings simulation, determined by net interest income analysis; 
 The maximum amount of acceptable decline in the present value of equity due to market risk, determined by economic value of equity analysis; 
 The maximum acceptable size of the investment portfolio relative to total assets; 
 Concentration limits on investment asset types to ensure appropriate portfolio diversification; 
 Maximum maturity and weighted average life per security at time of purchase in both a base case and a shocked rate scenario to measure extension risk; 
 The maximum acceptable duration of the investment and hedging derivatives portfolio; and 
 Guidelines on accounting classification of securities including held for trading, available for sale and held to maturity. 
 Policy limits are tested quarterly, and the results are reported to the Asset Liability Committee ALCO ), which is a subcommittee of management s Enterprise Risk Management Committee ERMC ), and to RMC. RMC advises the Board of Directors with respect to the adequacy of capital allocated based on the level of risk as well as risk issues that could impact liquidity and/or capital adequacy. From time to time, we expect we will exceed policy limits, in which case we may seek corrective action after considering, among other things, market conditions, customer reaction, and the estimated impact on profitability. A remediation plan will be presented to ALCO, ERMC and RMC that carefully outlines the proposed corrective action. 
 We attempt to manage interest rate risk by identifying, quantifying, and where appropriate, hedging our exposure to market risk. If assets and liabilities do not re-price simultaneously and in equal volume, the potential for interest rate exposure exists. Our objective is to maintain stability in the growth of net interest income through the maintenance of an appropriate mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and, when necessary and within limits that management determines to be prudent, through the use of off-balance sheet hedging instruments including, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, floors and caps. 
 Our asset-liability management strategy is devised and monitored by our ALCO in accordance with policies approved by RMC. ALCO operates under a charter developed and approved by ERMC. ALCO meets monthly, or more frequently as needed, to review, among other things, our sensitivity to interest rate changes, loan pricing and activity, investment activity and strategy, hedging strategies, deposit pricing and funding strategies with respect to overall balance sheet composition, as well as earnings simulations over multiple years. ALCO may meet more frequently if there are changes in the economic environment, such as rapid increases or decreases in interest rates due to or as a result of exogenous or unknown factors so that ALCO can make any necessary strategic adjustments to better manage interest rate risk. ALCO s membership is comprised of executive management of the Company, and representatives from various lines of business are in regular attendance, including representation from Enterprise Risk Management ERM ). ALCO reports regularly to RMC on these risks and objectives with independent oversight and reporting from our Financial and Model Risk Management group within ERM. 
 As a company offering banking and other financial services, certain elements of risk are inherent in our transactions and operations and are present in the business decisions we make. We, therefore, encounter risk as part of the normal course of our business, and we design risk management processes to help manage these risks. In its oversight of our risk management framework, the Board of Directors has adopted a formal Risk Appetite Statement RAS which defines the aggregate level of risk and the types of risk the Company is willing to assume to achieve its corporate strategy and objectives. The Board of Directors regularly assesses whether the approved policy limits, as described further above, conform to stated risk appetite. The Board of Directors monitors, on at least a quarterly basis, a set of key risk metrics, including those, but not limited to those, pertaining to market risk. Monitoring these metrics can help to identify trends in risk profile or emerging risks over time, and where applicable, determine where adjustments may be required to business strategy or tactics. Within our risk management framework, the functional responsibilities of risk management are divided into a tiered model, involving three lines of defense: 
 1. The Finance Department to which primary market risk ownership belongs including monitoring and tracking of risk, model development and maintenance, and execution of strategy and tactics to mitigate market risk; 
 2. The ERM Department which conducts independent risk and controls assessments to ensure appropriate risk identification, management, and reporting. The Model Risk Management group MRM within ERM is responsible for independent oversight of models used to measure market risk, including model and assumption implementation, development, and conceptual soundness; and

3. The Internal Audit Department which independently assesses the operating effectiveness of the first- and second-line processes and controls. 
 Comments on Recent Developments. During the past several years, the U.S. economy has experienced both sharp increases and decreases in interest rates. As noted in the earlier section titled Outlook and Trends within this Item 7, beginning in March 2022, the Federal Open Market Committee FOMC voted to increase the federal funds rate multiple times from a range of 0.00 to 0.25 to a range of 5.25 to 5.50 on July 26, 2023. The FOMC next adjusted the federal funds rate on September 18, 2024, when the FOMC reduced the target range by 50 basis points to a range of 4.75 to 5.00 and again on November 7, 2024, when the FOMC reduced the target range further by 25 basis points to a range of 4.25 to 4.75 . Our market risk management framework is designed for the potential for such rapid changes in interest rates, by establishing policy limits on such rapid shocks and periodically back-testing modeled to actual results. Back-testing of top-line results as well as key assumptions is performed against established thresholds as part of our ongoing monitoring governance of our models, and results are reported to ALCO and MRM. Should back-testing results exceed established performance thresholds, the model and underlying assumptions will be reviewed for recalibration. 
 Net Interest Income. We analyze our sensitivity to changes in interest rates through a net interest income NII model. We model our NII over a 12-month and 24-month period assuming no changes in interest rates and a static balance sheet, where cash flows from financial assets and liabilities are replaced with new business of similar terms at current rates. The impact of our interest rate derivatives designated as hedging instruments are included in the model results. We then model NII for the same period under the assumption that market rates increase and decrease instantaneously by certain basis point increments, which vary by period depending upon market conditions, with changes in interest rates representing immediate, permanent, and parallel shifts in the yield curve. A basis point equals one-hundredth of one percent, and 100 basis points equals one percent. An increase in interest rates from 3 to 4 would mean, for example, a 100 basis point increase in the Changes in Interest Rates column in the table below. 
 Many assumptions are made in the modeling process for both NII and economic value of equity EVE , discussed further below), including but not limited to the repricing and maturity characteristics of existing and new business, loan and security prepayments, administered deposit rate betas, duration of deposits without stated maturity dates, and other option risks. Management believes these assumptions to be reasonable for the various interest rate environments modeled. However, differences in actual results from these assumptions could change our exposure to interest rate risk. The models assume that the composition of our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assume that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Additionally, the model requires that interest rates remain positive for all points along the yield curve for each rate scenario which may preclude the modeling of certain falling rate scenarios during periods of lower market interest rates. We do not model negative interest rate scenarios. 
 Because of the limitations inherent in any modeling approach used to measure market risk, including NII and EVE sensitivity analysis, and because, in the event of changes in interest rates, management would take active steps to manage interest rate risk exposure among its financial assets and liabilities, modeling results, including those discussed in Interest Rate Sensitivity and EVE Interest Rate Sensitivity below, should not be relied upon as a forecast of actual NII or EVE, nor should they be interpreted as management s expectations of actual results in the event of such interest rate fluctuations. The tables provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, and actual results may differ.

The tables below set forth, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the modeled changes in our net interest income on an FTE basis that would result from the designated immediate changes in market interest rates: 
 Interest Rate Sensitivity

 (1) Assumes an immediate uniform change in market interest rates at all maturities. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our model, as indicated above, shows a decline in our net interest income in rising rate scenarios. In the rising rate scenarios, funding costs are modeled to rise faster than income on earning assets, due, in part, to the mix of funding which has shifted towards higher rate paying deposits, which are more sensitive to changes in interest rates. As shown in the table above, the model generated similar results as of December 31, 2023. That is, the model showed a decline in our net interest income in the rising rate scenarios as funding costs were modeled to rise faster than income on earning assets, due, in part, to the shift in our mix of funding. The simulation results are within policy limits and management therefore does not expect a material change to our current strategy over the near term. The rate scenarios that we model at each period end are dependent upon market conditions, which is why the rate scenarios that we model may differ from period-to-period. 
 Management may use techniques such as investment strategy, loan and deposit pricing, non-core funding strategies, and interest rate derivative financial instruments, within internal policy guidelines, to manage interest rate risk as part of our asset/liability strategy. Hedging strategies such as, for example, receive-fixed and pay-fixed swaps, interest rate caps, floors, or collars, may be used to protect against benchmark interest rates either rising or falling. The type of derivatives we primarily use to hedge market risk are interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedging instruments. When the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates in March of 2022 from very low levels, management began evaluating a derivative strategy designed to limit our exposure to downward rate scenarios. In 2022, management executed a total of 2.4 billion in notional value of receive-fixed interest rate swap agreements on floating-rate loans. These swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and management believes these derivatives provide significant protection against falling interest rates, as they have the effect of converting floating rate loan exposure to fixed rates. These receive-fixed swaps constitute the entirety of our current hedge portfolio. Management may, from time to time, due to actual or projected changes in market rates or our risk exposure, evaluate other hedging strategies, although we believe our current Net Interest Income and Economic Value of Equity simulation analyses support maintaining the current derivatives strategy. For additional information related to our interest rate derivative financial instruments, see Note 13, Derivative Financial Instruments within the Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Table of Contents 

Economic Value of Equity Analysis. We also analyze the sensitivity of our financial condition to changes in interest rates through our EVE model. This analysis calculates the difference between the present value of expected cash flows from assets and liabilities assuming various changes in current interest rates. 
 The tables below represent an analysis of our interest rate risk as measured by the estimated changes in our EVE, resulting from an instantaneous and sustained parallel shift in the yield curve (+100, +200, +400 basis points and -100, -200, and -400 basis points) at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The model requires that interest rates remain positive for all points along the yield curve for each rate scenario which may preclude the modeling of certain falling rate scenarios during periods of lower market interest rates. 
 Our earnings are not directly or materially impacted by movements in foreign currency rates or commodity prices. Movements in equity prices may have a modest impact on earnings by affecting the volume of activity or the amount of fees from investment-related business lines and by affecting the amount of unrealized gains and losses from securities held in rabbi trusts, the latter of which are partially offset by a corresponding but opposite impact to the amount of employee benefit expense associated with the change in value of plan assets.

 Liquidity, Capital Resources, Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies 
 Liquidity. Liquidity describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the normal course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet deposit withdrawals and anticipated loan fundings, as well as current and planned expenditures. We seek to maintain sources of liquidity that are reliable and diversified and that may be used during the normal course of business as well as on a contingency basis. 
 Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, and proceeds from calls, maturities and sales of securities, subject to market conditions. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan and securities prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are unencumbered cash and cash equivalents and securities classified as available for sale, which could be liquidated, subject to market conditions. In the future, 
 104 

Table of Contents 

our liquidity position will continue to be affected by the level of customer deposits and payments, loan originations and repayments, as well as any acquisitions, dividends, and share repurchases in which we may engage. For the next twelve months, we believe that our existing resources, including our capacity to use brokered deposits and wholesale borrowings, will be sufficient to meet the liquidity and capital requirements of our operations. We may elect to raise additional capital through the sale of additional equity or debt financing to fund business activities such as strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, or other purposes beyond the next twelve months. 
 We participate in the IntraFi Network, which allows us to provide access to FDIC deposit insurance protection on customer deposits for consumers, businesses and public entities that exceed same-bank FDIC insurance thresholds. We can elect to sell or repurchase this funding as reciprocal deposits from other IntraFi Network banks depending on our funding needs. At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 we had no IntraFi Network one-way sell deposits. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had repurchased 2.1 billion and 1.3 billion, respectively, of previously sold reciprocal deposits. 
 Although customer deposits remain our preferred source of funds, maintaining additional sources of liquidity is part of our prudent liquidity risk management practices. We have the ability to borrow from the FHLBB. At September 30, 2024, we had 17.3 million in outstanding advances and the ability to borrow up to an additional 2.4 billion. We also have the ability to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. At September 30, 2024, we had the ability to borrow up to 2.9 billion from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston Discount Window. At September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents were 889.5 million and secured borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank totaled 5.3 billion, providing total liquidity sources of 6.2 billion. These liquidity sources provided 92 coverage of all customer uninsured and uncollateralized deposits, which totaled 6.7 billion, or 32 of total deposits, as of September 30, 2024. For further discussion of uninsured deposits, refer to the Deposits discussion within the Financial Position section within this Item 2. 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 As of September 30, 2024 As of December 31, 2023 Outstanding Additional Capacity Outstanding Additional Capacity (In thousands) IntraFi deposits 2,109,717 1,309,816 Brokered deposits (1) 50,000 Federal Home Loan Bank (2) 17,342 2,441,559 17,738 2,865,582 Federal Reserve Bank of Boston- Bank Term Funding Program (3) 2,449,438 Federal Reserve Bank of Boston- Discount Window (4) 2,864,140 775,869 Total 2,127,059 5,305,699 1,377,554 6,090,889 
 (1) The additional borrowing capacity has not been assessed for this category. 
 (2) As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, loans with a carrying value of 2.3 billion and 4.6 billion, respectively, and securities with a carrying value of 1.1 billion at September 30, 2024 were pledged to the FHLBB resulting in this additional unused borrowing capacity. No securities were pledged to the FHLBB as collateral as of December 31, 2023. 
 (3) Securities with a carrying value of 2.4 billion at December 31, 2023 were pledged to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston under the Bank Term Funding Program, resulting in this additional unused borrowing capacity. The Bank Term Funding Program ceased extending new loans March 11, 2024. Accordingly, we had no additional capacity nor any securities pledged to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston under the Bank Term Funding Program as of September 30, 2024. 
 (4) Loans with a carrying value of 3.1 billion and 1.1 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and securities with a carrying value of 827.8 million and 168.8 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, were pledged to the Discount Window, resulting in this additional borrowing capacity. The increase in the amount of securities pledged to the Discount Window at September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023 is due to additional securities pledged which were previously pledged as collateral to the Bank Term Funding Program. 
 We believe that advanced preparation, early detection, and prompt responses can avoid, minimize, or shorten potential liquidity constraints. Our Board of Directors and management s ALCO oversee the assessment and monitoring of risk levels, as well as potential responses during unanticipated stress events. As part of our risk management framework, we perform periodic liquidity stress testing to assess our need for liquid assets as well as backup sources of liquidity. 
 Capital Resources. We are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve (with respect to our consolidated capital requirements). At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we exceeded all applicable regulatory capital requirements, and were considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines. To be categorized as well-capitalized, the Company must maintain (1) a minimum of total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0 ; (2) a minimum of common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5 ; (3) a 
 105 

Table of Contents 

minimum of Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.0 ; and (4) a minimum of Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.0 . Management believes that the Company met all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. There have been no conditions or events that management believes would cause a change in the Company s categorization. 
 The Company s actual capital ratios are presented in the following table: 
 As of September 30, 2024 As of December 31, 2023 Capital Ratios: Average equity to average assets (1) 14.08 11.83 Total regulatory capital (to risk-weighted assets) 16.58 19.55 Common equity Tier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets) 15.52 18.55 Tier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets) 15.52 18.55 Tier 1 capital (to average assets) leverage 12.61 14.00 
 (1) The ratio presented as of September 30, 2024 represents quarter-to-date average equity as a percentage of quarter-to-date average total assets. 
 Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies. In the ordinary course of our operations, we enter into certain contractual obligations. Such obligations include data processing services, operating leases for premises and equipment, agreements with respect to borrowed funds and deposit liabilities. At September 30, 2024, there were no material changes in our contractual obligations, other commitments and contingencies from those disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 We are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. The financial instruments include commitments to originate loans, unused lines of credit, unadvanced portions of construction loans and standby letters of credit, all of which involve elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of the instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments as we do for on-balance sheet instruments. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 6.9 billion of commitments to originate loans, comprised of 4.2 billion of commitments under commercial loans and lines of credit (including 811.1 million of unadvanced portions of construction loans), 2.3 billion of commitments under home equity loans and lines of credit, 222.1 million in standard overdraft coverage commitments, 43.0 million of unfunded commitments related to residential real estate loans and 128.2 million in other consumer loans and lines of credit. In addition, at September 30, 2024, we had 82.9 million in standby letters of credit outstanding. We also had 16.3 million in forward commitments to sell loans. 
 Commitments to originate loans are agreements to lend to a customer provided there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since a portion of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.
