 million and million for the exchange of foreign currencies at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. To date, the Company has chosen not to designate these derivatives as hedging instruments, and accordingly, these instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in other income and expense. 
 
 ) Net foreign currency transactional and re-measurement (gains) losses ) Net foreign currency exchange losses 
 
 Net foreign currency exchange gains and losses consist of foreign currency transactional and functional currency re-measurements, offset by net foreign currency exchange contract gains and losses and are included in other income and expense. Foreign exchange gains and losses are generated as the result of fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the Brazilian real and the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar. 
 
 Interest Rates - The Company s earnings are also affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on interest expense from floating rate debt instruments. The Company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates by using interest rate swaps to hedge this exposure and to achieve a desired proportion of fixed versus floating rate debt. 
 
 On April 30, 2019, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to lock into a fixed LIBOR interest rate, which was amended on September 28, 2022, to change the reference rate from LIBOR to SOFR. The swap agreement has a notional amount of million, with a million tranche that matured on April 30, 2024 and a million tranche scheduled to mature April 30, 2026. 
 
 On March 31, 2023, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to lock into a fixed SOFR interest rate with a notional amount of million and a maturity date of March 31, 2028. 
 
 These interest rate swap agreements are designated as cash flow hedges to hedge the variable rate interest payments on the revolving credit facility. Interest rate differentials paid or received under the swap agreements are recognized as adjustments to interest expense. To the extent the swaps are effective in offsetting the variability of the hedged cash flows, changes in the fair value of the swaps are not included in current earnings but are reported as other comprehensive income (loss). There was no ineffective portion to be recorded as an adjustment to earnings for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 The investments in the deferred compensation plan are held in a "rabbi trust" and include mutual funds and cash equivalents for payment of non-qualified benefits for certain retired, terminated and active employees. These investments are recorded to prepaid expenses and other current assets or other non-current assets depending on their corresponding, anticipated distribution dates to recipients, which are reported in accrued expenses and other current liabilities or other long-term liabilities, respectively. 
 
 Derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward contracts, are measured using the market approach on a recurring basis considering foreign currency spot rates and forward rates quoted by banks or foreign currency dealers and interest rates quoted by banks (Level 2). Fair values of interest rate swaps are measured using standard valuation models with inputs that can be derived from observable market transactions, including SOFR spot and forward rates (Level 2). Foreign currency contracts and interest rate swap agreements are classified in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as prepaid expenses and other non-current assets or accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities, depending on the respective instruments' favorable or unfavorable positions. See Note 8 - Derivatives and Hedging Activities . 
 
 The Company recorded a contingent consideration liability at the acquisition date of both Advantix and Resourcive. These liabilities represent the amounts payable to former owners, as outlined under the terms of the asset purchase agreements, based upon the achievement of a projected earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, net of specific pro forma adjustments. 

The fair values of amounts owed are recorded in current portion of contingent consideration and long-term portion of contingent consideration in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. In accordance with ASC 805, the Company will revalue the contingent consideration liability at each reporting date through the last payment, with changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration reflected in the change in fair value of contingent consideration line item on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Income Statements that is included in the calculation of operating income. The fair value of the contingent consideration liability associated with future earnout payments is based on several factors, including but not limited to: 
 
 estimated future results, net of pro forma adjustments set forth in the purchase agreements; 
 a risk premium reflective of the Company s creditworthiness and market risk premium associated with the United States markets. 
 Advantix 
 
 Advantix Solutions Group, Inc ("Advantix") is part of the Specialty Technology Solutions segment. The fair value of the contingent consideration is determined using a static discounted cash flow model. The fair value of the liability for the contingent consideration related to Advantix recognized at September 30, 2024 was million, of which million is classified as current. The fair value at September 30, 2024 approximated the fair value recognized upon acquisition in August 2024, as such no change in fair value of contingent consideration was recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Income Statements. Earnout payments to the former owners of Advantix are payable based on results from fiscal year 2025 to fiscal year 2028.

Certain operating lease agreements contain options to extend or terminate the lease. The lease term used is adjusted for these options when the Company is reasonably certain it will exercise the option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease payments not based on a rate or index, such as costs for common area maintenance, are expensed as incurred. Further, the Company has elected the practical expedient to recognize all lease and non-lease components as a single lease component, where applicable.

 Results of Operations 

Net Sales 
 
 We have two reportable segments, which are based on sales channels. The following tables summarize our net sales results by operating segment and by geographic location for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Quarter ended September 30, Change, Constant Currency, Excluding Divestitures and Acquisitions (a) 
 Net Sales by Segment: 2024 2023 Change Change (in thousands) Specialty Technology Solutions 752,299 853,950 (101,651) (11.9) (11.1) Intelisys Advisory 23,281 22,355 926 4.1 1.5 Total net sales 775,580 876,305 (100,725) (11.5) (10.7) 
 (a) A reconciliation of non-GAAP net sales in constant currency, excluding divestitures and acquisitions, is presented at the end of Results of Operations , under Non-GAAP Financial Information. 
 
 Specialty Technology Solutions 
 
 The Specialty Technology Solutions segment consists of sales to customers primarily in the United States, Canada and Brazil through value-added resellers. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, net sales decreased 101.7 million, or 11.9 , compared to the prior-year period. Excluding the foreign exchange positive impact and sales from divestitures and acquisitions, adjusted net sales decreased 94.2 million , or 11.1 , for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior-year period. The decrease in net sales and adjusted net sales for the quarter is primarily due to continued soft demand in a more cautious technology spending environment. 
 
 Intelisys Advisory 
 
 The Intelisys Advisory segment consists of sales to sales partners primarily in the United States through technology services distributors and technology advisors. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, net sales increased 0.9 million, or 4.1 , compared to the prior-year period. Excluding the foreign exchange positive impact and sales from acquisitions, adjusted net sales increased 0.3 million, or 1.5 , for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior-year period. The increase in net sales and adjusted net sales for the quarter is primarily due to higher Intelisys sales. Quarterly net billings for Intelisys increased 6 over the prior-year quarter to bring annualized net billings to approximat ely 2.74 billion.

 Gross Profit 
 
 The following table summarizes our gross profit for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 
 Quarter ended September 30, of Net Sales September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change 2024 2023 (in thousands) Specialty Technology Solutions 78,457 84,263 (5,806) (6.9) 10.4 9.9 Intelisys Advisory 23,162 22,245 917 4.1 99.5 99.5 Gross profit 101,619 106,508 (4,889) (4.6) 13.1 12.2 
 Our gross profit is primarily affected by sales volume and gross margin mix. Gross margin mix is impacted by multiple factors, which include sales mix (proportion of sales of higher margin products or services relative to total sales), vendor program recognition (consisting of volume rebates, inventory price changes and purchase discounts) and freight costs. Increases in vendor program recognition decrease cost of goods sold, thereby increasing gross profit. Net sales derived from our Intelisys business contribute 100 to our gross profit dollars and margin as they have no associated cost of goods sold. 
 
 Specialty Technology Solutions 
 
 For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, gross profit dollars for the Specialty Technology Solutions segment declined 5.8 million, or 6.9 , compared to the prior-year quarter. Lower sales volume, after considering the associated cost of goods sold, reduced gross profit dollars by 9.2 million. Gross profit margin increased 45 basis points over the prior year quarter to 10.4 . Gross margin mix positively impacted gross profit by 3.4 million largely due to higher vendor program recognition and favorable sales mix. 
 
 Intelisys Advisory 
 
 For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, gross profit dollars for the Intelisys Advisory segment increased 0.9 million, or 4.1 , compared to the prior-year quarter. Higher sales volume increased gross profit dollars by 0.9 million. Gross profit margin remained consistent at 99.5 . 

Operating Expenses 
 
 The following table summarizes our operating expenses for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 Selling, general and administrative expenses SG A decreased by 3.7 million, or 4.9 , for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior-year period. The decrease for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 is primarily attributable to lower employee costs and reduced customer specific bad debt expenses in the United States and Canada. 
 
 Restructuring and other charges incurred of 5.1 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 related to employee separation and benefit costs in connection with our expense reduction and restructuring plans implemented in September 2024.

 Specialty Technology Solutions 
 
 For the Specialty Technology Solutions segment, operating income decreased 0.9 million, or 5.1 , for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior-year period. Operating margin remained at 2.2 for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. The decrease in operating income for the quarter is primarily due to lower gross profits. 
 
 Intelisys Advisory 
 
 For the Intelisys Advisory segment, operating income decreased 0.2 million, or 3.5 , for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior-year period. Operating margin decreased to 27.5 from 29.7 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 primarily driven by higher employee expenses for the quarter. 
 
 Corporate 
 
 For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, Corporate incurred an operating loss of 5.5 million which represents restructuring and acquisition-related costs.

 Interest expense consists primarily of interest incurred on borrowings, non-utilization fees charged on the revolving credit facility and amortization of debt issuance costs. Interest expense decreased for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior-year period, primarily from lower average borrowings on our multi-currency revolving credit facility. 
 
 Interest income increased for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 primarily from interest earned on higher cash balances in the United States.

 Net foreign exchange gains and losses consist of foreign currency transactional and functional currency re-measurements, offset by net foreign exchange forward contracts gains and losses. Foreign exchange gains and losses are generated as the result of fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the Brazilian real, the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar, the euro versus the U.S. dollar, and the British pound versus the U.S. dollar. We partially offset foreign currency exposure with the use of foreign exchange contracts to hedge against these exposures. The costs associated with foreign exchange forward contracts are included in the net foreign exchange losses. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a 5.1 million gain as a result of an insurance recovery in connection with the cybersecurity attack in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. 

Provision for Income Taxes 
 
 For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, income tax expense was 6.0 million reflecting an effective tax rate of 26.1 . In comparison, for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, income tax expense was 3.7 million reflecting an effective tax rate of 19.4 . The increase in the effective tax rate for the quarter is primarily due to a decrease in non-taxable income and discrete items. We expect the effective tax rate, excluding discrete items, for fiscal year 2025 to be approximately 28.9 to 29.9 . See Note 13 - Income Taxes to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 

Non-GAAP Financial Information 
 
 Evaluating Financial Condition and Operating Performance 
 
 In addition to disclosing results that are determined in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles US GAAP or GAAP ), we also disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures include non-GAAP operating income; non-GAAP pre-tax income; non-GAAP net income; non-GAAP EPS; adjusted earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization adjusted EBITDA adjusted return on invested capital adjusted ROIC and constant currency. Constant currency is a measure that excludes the translation exchange impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates between reporting periods. We use non-GAAP financial measures to better understand and evaluate performance, including comparisons from period to period. 
 
 These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and the non-GAAP financial measures that we report may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies. Analysis of results and outlook on a non-GAAP basis should be considered in addition to, and not in substitution for or as superior to, measurements of financial performance prepared in accordance with US GAAP. 

Adjusted Return on Invested Capital 
 
 Adjusted ROIC assists us in comparing our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis because it removes from our operating results the impact of items that do not reflect our core operating performance. We believe the calculation of adjusted ROIC provides useful information to investors and is an additional relevant comparison of our performance during the year. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA starts with net income and adds back interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation expense, amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, and other non-GAAP adjustments. Since adjusted EBITDA excludes some non-cash costs of investing in our business and people, we believe that adjusted EBITDA shows the profitability from our business operations more clearly. 
 
 We calculate adjusted ROIC as adjusted EBITDA, divided by invested capital. Invested capital is defined as average equity plus average daily funded interest-bearing debt for the period. The following table summarizes annualized adjusted ROIC for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively: 
 
 Quarter ended September 30, 2024 2023 Adjusted return on invested capital ratio, annualized (a) 
 13.3 11.0 
 (a) The annualized EBITDA amount is divided by days in the quarter times 365 days per year, or 366 days for leap year. There were 92 days in the current and prior-year quarter. 
 
 The components of this calculation and reconciliation to our financial statements are shown on the following schedule:

Net Sales in Constant Currency Excluding Acquisitions and Divestitures 
 
 We make references to constant currency, a non-GAAP performance measure that excludes the foreign exchange rate impact from fluctuations in the average foreign exchange rates between reporting periods. Constant currency is calculated by translating current period results from currencies other than the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars using the comparable average foreign exchange rates from the prior year period. We also exclude the impact of acquisitions or divestitures prior to the first full year of operations from the acquisition or divestiture date in order to show net sales results on an organic basis. This information is provided to analyze underlying trends without the translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. Below we show organic growth by providing a non-GAAP reconciliation of net sales in constant currency excluding acquisitions and divestitures:

 Additional Non-GAAP Metrics 
 
 To evaluate current period performance on a more consistent basis with prior periods, we disclose non-GAAP SG A expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP pre-tax income, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. Non-GAAP results exclude amortization of intangible assets related to divestitures, cyberattack restoration costs and other non-GAAP adjustments. These year-over-year metrics include the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These metrics are useful in assessing and understanding our operating performance, especially when comparing results with previous periods or forecasting performance for future periods.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our 350 million revolving credit facility. Our business requires significant investment in working capital, particularly accounts receivable and inventory, partially financed through our accounts payable to vendors, cash generated from operations and revolving lines of credit. In general, as our sales volume increases, our net investment in working capital increases, which typically results in decreased cash flow from operating activities. Conversely, when sales volume decreases, our net investment in working capital typically decreases, which typically results in increased cash flow from operating activities. 

Our cash and cash equivalents balance totaled 145.0 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 185.5 million at June 30, 2024, including 32.6 million and 20.0 million held outside of the United States at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. Checks released but not yet cleared in the amount of 0.3 million and 5.9 million are included in accounts payable at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. 

We conduct business primarily in the United States, Canada and Brazil where we generate and use cash. We provide for United States income taxes from the earnings of our Canadian and Brazilian subsidiaries. See Note 13 - Income Taxes in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 

Our net investment in working capital, defined as accounts receivable plus inventories less accounts payable, decreased 13.6 million to 492.5 million at September 30, 2024 from 506.2 million at June 30, 2024, primarily from decreases in inventory and accounts receivable, partially offset by lower accounts payable, as a result of lower sales volume reflecting the results of our multi-quarter working capital improvement plan. Our net investment in working capital is affected by several factors such as fluctuations in sales volume, net income, timing of collections from customers, increases and decreases to inventory levels and payments to vendors. 

Three months ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in thousands) Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 44,830 93,533 Investing activities (59,224) (2,315) Financing activities (26,630) (83,493) 

Operating cash flows are subject to variability period over period as a result of the timing of payments related to accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other working capital items. Net cash provided by operating activities was 44.8 million and 93.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively . Cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily attributable to net income adjusted for non-cash items plus reductions in accounts receivable and inventory partially offset by a reduction in accounts payable. Compared to September 30, 2023 , accounts receivable and inventory decreased 18.0 and 23.2 respectively, while accounts payable decreased 6.3 . 

The number of days sales outstanding ("DSO") was 66 days at September 30, 2024, compared to 71 days at June 30, 2024 and 71 days at September 30, 2023. Inventory turned 5.3 times during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.0 times during the quarter ended June 30, 2024 and 4.4 times in the prior-year quarter ended September 30, 2023. 

Cash used in investing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 59.2 million, compared to 2.3 million used in investing activities in the prior-year period. Cash used in investing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is largely due to cash paid for acquisitions and capital expenditures. Cash used in investing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2023 represents capital expenditures. 
 
 Management expects capital expenditures for fiscal year 2025 to range from 10.0 million to 15.0 million, prim arily for IT investments.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 , cash used in financing activities totaled 26.6 million and 83.5 million, respectively. Cash used in financing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily attributable to common stock repurchases in the quarter. Cash used in financing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily attributable to net borrowings on the revolving credit facility. 

Credit Facility 
 
 We have a multi-currency senior secured credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of banks (as amended, the Amended Credit Agreement ). On September 28, 2022, we amended and restated our Amended Credit Agreement, which includes (i) a five-year, 350 million multicurrency senior secured revolving credit facility and (ii) a five-year 150 million senior secured term loan facility. The Amended Credit Agreement extended the credit facility maturity date to September 28, 2027. In addition, pursuant to an accordion feature, we may increase our borrowing limits up to an additional 250 million, subject to obtaining additional credit commitments from the lenders participating in the increase. The Amended Credit Agreement allows for the issuance of up to 50 million for letters of credit. Borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement are guaranteed by substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of our domestic assets. Under the terms of the revolving credit facility, the payment of cash dividends is restricted. We incurred debt issuance costs of 1.4 million in connection with the amendment and restatement of the Amended Credit Agreement. These costs were capitalized to other non-current assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and added to the unamortized debt issuance costs from the previous credit facility. 
 
 Loans denominated in U.S. dollars, other than swingline loans, bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, (i) the adjusted term SOFR or adjusted daily simple SOFR plus an additional margin ranging from 1.00 to 1.75 depending upon our ratio of (A) total consolidated debt less up to 30 million of unrestricted domestic cash to (B) trailing four-quarter consolidated EBITDA measured as of the end of the most recent year or quarter, as applicable, for which financial statements have been delivered to the Lenders (the leverage ratio or (ii) the alternate base rate plus an additional margin ranging from 0 to 0.75 , depending upon our leverage ratio, plus, if applicable, certain mandatory costs. All swingline loans denominated in U.S. dollars bear interest based upon the adjusted daily simple SOFR plus an additional margin ranging from 1.00 to 1.75 depending upon our leverage ratio, or such other rate as agreed upon with the applicable swingline lender. The adjusted term SOFR and adjusted daily simple SOFR include a fixed credit adjustment of 0.10 over the applicable SOFR reference rate. Loans denominated in foreign currencies bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the applicable benchmark rate set forth in the Amended Credit Agreement plus an additional margin ranging from 1.00 to 1.75 , depending upon our leverage ratio plus, if applicable, certain mandatory costs. 
 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, our borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement were U.S. dollar loans. The spread in effect as of September 30, 2024 was 1.00 for SOFR-based loans and 0.00 for alternate base rate loans. The commitment fee rate in effect at September 30, 2024 was 0.15 . The Amended Credit Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants. Specifically, our Leverage Ratio must be less than or equal to 3.50 to 1.00 at all times. In addition, our Interest Coverage Ratio (as such term is defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) must be at least 3.00 to 1.00 at the end of each fiscal quarter. In the event of a default, customary remedies are available to the lenders, including acceleration and increased interest rates. We were in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility at September 30, 2024. 
 
 The average daily outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility, excluding the term loan facility, during the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 w as 144.0 million and 200.9 million, respectively. There was 350.0 million and 349.9 million available for additional borrowings as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. The effective interest rates for the revolving line of credit were 5.95 and 6.44 as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. There were no letters of credit issued under the multi-currency revolving credit facility at September 30, 2024 or June 30, 2024. Availability to use this borrowing capacity depends upon, among other things, the levels of our Leverage Ratio and Interest Coverage Ratio, which, in turn, will depend upon (1) our Credit Facility Net Debt relative to our Credit Facility EBITDA and (2) Credit Facility EBITDA relative to total interest expense, respectively. As a result, our availability will increase if EBITDA increases (subject to the limit of the facility) and decrease if EBITDA decreases. While we were in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the Amended Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2024, and currently expect to continue to maintain such compliance, should we encounter difficulties, our historical relationship with our Amended Credit Agreement lending group has been strong and we anticipate their continued support of our long-term business. 

Summary 
 We believe that our existing sources of liquidity, including cash resources and cash provided by operating activities, supplemented as necessary with funds under our credit agreements, will provide sufficient resources to meet our present and

 future working capital and cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. We also believe that our longer-term working capital, planned expenditures and other general funding requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities.
