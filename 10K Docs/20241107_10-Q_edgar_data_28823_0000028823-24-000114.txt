 ) Effective Tax Rate 
 
 The effective tax rate on the loss from continuing operations was and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The effective tax rate differed compared to the U.S. federal statutory rate for the variations in the expected jurisdictional mix of earnings and expected permanent tax differences relative to pretax earnings. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company estimated its annual effective tax rate and applied it to year-to-date ordinary income/loss pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740-270-25-1. The Company reports the tax effect of unusual or infrequently occurring items, including changes in judgement about valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, and effects of changes in tax laws or rates in the interim period in which they occur. The BEPS 2.0 Pillar Two global minimum tax rules, previously enacted by several jurisdictions in which the Company operates, became effective in 2024. The Company does not estimate a material impact on its annual effective tax rate from these rules.

 Costs incurred for the development of external-use software that will be sold, leased or otherwise marketed are capitalized when technological feasibility has been established. These costs are included within other assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives ranging from three to . Amortization begins when the product is available for general release. Costs capitalized include direct labor and related overhead costs. Costs incurred prior to technological feasibility or after general release are expensed as incurred. The Company performs periodic reviews to ensure that unamortized program costs remain recoverable from future revenue. If future revenue does not support the unamortized program costs, the amount by which the unamortized capitalized cost of a software product exceeds the net realizable value is impaired.

per Diebold Nixdorf AG share (of which million shares were then outstanding) and the annual recurring compensation of per Diebold Nixdorf AG share offered in connection with the DPLTA. 
 
 The second appraisal proceeding relates to the cash merger squeeze-out of minority shareholders of Diebold Nixdorf AG in 2019 and is currently pending at the same Chamber for Commercial Matters (Kammer f r Handelssachen) at the District Court (Landgericht) of Dortmund (Germany) that was originally competent for the DPLTA appraisal proceedings. The squeeze-out appraisal proceeding was filed by former minority shareholders of Diebold Nixdorf AG challenging the adequacy of the cash exit compensation of per Diebold Nixdorf AG share (of which million shares were then outstanding) in connection with the merger squeeze-out. 
 
 In both appraisal proceedings, a court ruling would apply to all Diebold Nixdorf AG shares outstanding at the time when the DPLTA or the merger squeeze-out, respectively, became effective. Any cash compensation received by former Diebold Nixdorf AG shareholders in connection with the merger squeeze-out would be netted with any higher cash compensation such shareholder may still claim in connection with the DPLTA appraisal proceeding. The District Court of Dortmund dismissed in 2022 all claims to increase the cash compensation and the annual recurring compensation in the DPLTA appraisal proceeding and rejected in 2023 all claims to increase the cash compensation in the merger squeeze-out appraisal proceeding. These first instance decisions, however, are not final as some of the respective plaintiffs filed appeals in both, the DPLTA appraisal proceeding and the squeeze-out appraisal proceeding. 
 
 The Company believes that the compensation offered in connection with the DPLTA and the merger squeeze-out was in both cases fair and that the decisions of the District Court of Dortmund in the DPLTA and merger squeeze-out appraisal proceedings validate its position. German courts often adjudicate increases of the cash compensation to plaintiffs in varying amounts in connection with German appraisal proceedings. Therefore, the Company cannot rule out that a court may increase the cash compensation in these appraisal proceedings. The Company, however, is convinced that its defense in both appraisal proceedings is supported by strong sets of facts and the Company will continue to vigorously defend itself in these matters. Related legal fees are expensed as incurred. 
 
 Bank Guarantees, Standby Letters of Credit, and Surety Bonds 
 In the ordinary course of business, the Company may issue performance guarantees on behalf of its subsidiaries to certain customers and other parties. Some of those guarantees may be backed by standby letters of credit, surety bonds, or similar instruments. In general, under the guarantees, the Company would be obligated to perform, or cause performance, over the term of the underlying contract in the event of an unexcused, uncured breach by its subsidiary, or some other specified triggering event, in each case as defined by the applicable guarantee. At September 30, 2024, the maximum future contractual obligations relative to these various guarantees totaled , of which represented standby letters of credit to insurance providers, and no associated liability was recorded. At December 31, 2023, the maximum future payment obligations relative to these various guarantees totaled , of which represented standby letters of credit to insurance providers, and no associated liability was recorded.

Results of Operations 
 
 The following discussion of the Company s financial condition and results of operations provides information that will assist in understanding the financial statements and the changes in certain key items in those financial statements. This discussion focuses on the drivers of Successor results for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 as well as the drivers of each of the 2023 Predecessor and Successor results for the period from August 12, 2023 through September 30, 2023. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes that appear elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 The Company calculates constant currency by translating the prior-year period results at the current year exchange rate. 
 
 Banking net sales in both the three and nine month periods of 2024 Successor reflect higher ATM unit sales volume and relatively flat service revenue compared to the 2023 Successor and Predecessor periods. Retail net sales in the 2024 Successor periods were challenged by market headwinds due to retailer's spend environment.

Three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 (Successor) compared with each of the 2023 Successor and Predecessor Periods 
 2024 Successor period product gross margin for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was favorable over the 2023 Successor and Predecessor periods, primarily due to product sales unit volume at favorable pricing as well as favorable logistics costs and normalization of certain raw material costs, most notably semiconductor chips. Further enhancing product gross margin the 2024 Successor period for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a PIS/COFIN tax recovery in Brazil. 
 
 Service gross margin for the 2024 Successor period continues to experience compression due to investments in resource and service infrastructure, in addition to absorption of charges related to the application of ASC 852, specifically depreciation and amortization of assets that were stepped up to fair value as a result of the Company's emergence from the Restructuring Proceedings.

 Interest income remained materially consistent across all periods presented, while interest expense in the 2024 Successor period was driven by the lower debt balances partially offset by increased variable interest rates. Refer to Note 10 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further detail. Foreign exchange gain (loss), net includes realized gains and losses, with the most material fluctuations observed in the Brazilian Real, Colombian Peso, Euro, Mexican Peso and Thai Baht exposures. Miscellaneous gain, net was primarily driven by recognition of non-service pension credits, the most significant of which are in Germany. 
 
 Reorganization items, net in the 2023 periods were directly related to the Company's filing and subsequent emergence from the Restructuring Proceedings. For further details please refer to Notes 2 and 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements.

 (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 

collateralization of letters of credit thereunder totaled 241.0 and was comprised of 211.2 of principal and interest and 29.8 of cash collateralized letters of credit. 
 
 On the Effective Date, the Company s existing the DIP Facility was terminated and the loans outstanding under the DIP Facility were converted into loans outstanding under the Exit Facility (the Conversion), and the liens and guarantees, including all guarantees and liens granted by certain subsidiaries of the Company that are organized in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions, granted under the DIP Facility were automatically terminated and released. In connection with the Conversion, the entire 1,250.0 under the Exit Facility was deemed drawn on the Effective Date. The Exit Facility will mature on August 11, 2028. 
 
 On February 13, 2024, the Company, as borrower, entered into a credit agreement (the Revolving Credit Agreement) with certain financial institutions party thereto, as lenders, and PNC Bank, National Association, as administrative agent and collateral agent. The Revolving Credit Agreement provides for a superior-priority senior secured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility) in an aggregate principal amount of 200.0, which includes a 50.0 letter of credit sub-limit and a 20.0 swing loan sub-limit. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility may be used by the Company for (i) the repayment of outstanding principal under the senior secured term loans under the Exit Credit Agreement and (ii) general corporate purposes and working capital. Loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest at an adjusted secured overnight financing rate plus 4.00 per annum or an adjusted base rate plus 3.00 per annum.

 Operating Activities 
 Cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as working capital needs and the timing of payments impact reported cash flows. 
 
 Cash flows from operating activities during the Successor period ended September 30, 2024 were driven by cash provided by trade receivables and cash uses for inventories, accounts payable and deferred revenue. The key drivers of these cash flows are timing of sales, collections, and vendor payments which can fluctuate significantly period to period.

Cash flows from operating activities during the Successor period ended September 30, 2023 were driven by uses for trade receivables and deferred revenue as well as cash provided by inventories and accounts payable. The key drivers of these cash flows are timing of sales, collections, and vendor payments which can fluctuate significantly period to period. 
 Cash flows from operating activities during the Predecessor period ended August 11, 2023 were driven primarily by uses for inventory and accounts payable. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 Cash flows from investing activities during the Successor and Predecessor periods, respectively, approximate normal operations of the Company and reflect expected trend. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 Cash flows from financing activities during the Successor period ended September 30, 2024 draw under the Revolving Credit Facility which was used to pay down the Exit Facility, and a 161.3 repayment of the Revolving Credit Facility (refer to Note 10 of the condensed consolidated financial statements). Cash flows from financing activities during the during the 2023 Predecessor period primarily relate to the Restructuring Proceedings. Refer to Notes 2, 3, and 9 for further details. 
 
 Contractual and Other Material Cash Obligations 
 The Company enters into certain purchase commitments due within one year for materials through contract manufacturing agreements for a total negotiated price. At September 30, 2024, the Company had minimal purchase commitments due within one year for materials through contract manufacturing agreements at negotiated prices. 
 
 Except for the repayment of the Exit Facility and the incurrence of debt under the Revolving Credit Facility, contractual and other cash obligations with initial and remaining terms in excess of one year and contingent liabilities remained generally unchanged at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 The Company enters into various arrangements not recognized in the consolidated balance sheets that have or could have an effect on its financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. The principal off-balance sheet arrangements that the Company enters into are guarantees and sales of finance lease receivables. The Company provides its global operations guarantees and standby letters of credit through various financial institutions to suppliers, customers, regulatory agencies and insurance providers. If the Company is not able to comply with its contractual obligations, the suppliers, regulatory agencies and insurance providers may draw on the pertinent bank. The Company has sold finance lease receivables to financial institutions while continuing to service the receivables. The Company records these sales by removing finance lease receivables from the consolidated balance sheets and recording gains and losses in the consolidated statement of operations. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 Management s discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. The condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Such estimates include revenue recognition, the valuation of trade receivables, inventories, goodwill, intangible assets, other long-lived assets, legal contingencies, and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes, pension and post-retirement benefits and customer incentives, among others. These estimates and assumptions are based on management s best estimates and judgment. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors. Management monitors the economic conditions and other factors and will adjust such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. 
 
 All other material critical accounting policies and estimates are described in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Statements can generally be identified as forward looking because they include words such as believes, anticipates, expects, intends, plans, will, estimates, potential, target, predict, project, seek, and variations thereof or could, should or words of similar meaning. Statements that describe the Company's future plans, objectives or goals are also forward-looking statements, which reflect the current views of the Company with respect to future events and are subject to assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Although the Company believes that these forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions regarding, among other things, the economy, its knowledge of its business, and key performance indicators that impact the Company, these forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements.

 the Company s ability to generate sufficient cash or have sufficient access to capital resources to service its debt, which, if unsuccessful or insufficient, could force the Company to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance its indebtedness; 
 the Company s ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements governing its debt; 
 the Company s ability to successfully convert its backlog into sales, including our ability to overcome supply chain and liquidity challenges;

 the success of the Company s new products, including its DN Series line and EASY family of retail checkout solutions, and electronic vehicle charging service business; 
 the impact of a cybersecurity incident or operational failure on the Company s business; 
 the Company s ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees; 
 the Company s reliance on suppliers, subcontractors and availability of raw materials and other components; 
 changes in the Company s intention to further repatriate cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments residing in international tax jurisdictions, which could negatively impact foreign and domestic taxes; 
 the Company s success in divesting, reorganizing or exiting non-core and/or non-accretive businesses and its ability to successfully manage acquisitions, divestitures, and alliances; 
 the ultimate outcome of the appeals for the appraisal proceedings initiated in connection with the implementation of the Domination and Profit Loss Transfer Agreement with the former Diebold Nixdorf AG (which was dismissed in the Company s favor at the lower court level in 2022) and the merger/squeeze-out (which was dismissed in the Company's favor at the lower court level in 2023); 
 the impact of market and economic conditions, including the bankruptcies, restructuring or consolidations of financial institutions, which could reduce the Company s customer base and/or adversely affect its customers' ability to make capital expenditures, as well as adversely impact the availability and cost of credit;
