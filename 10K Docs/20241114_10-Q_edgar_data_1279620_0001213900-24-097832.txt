square feet being leased to the lessee, increasing the premises to a total of square feet of operational space. In connection with
this lease amendment, the Company paid to the tenant as a tenant improvement allowance or lease incentive for investment into
the premises, which was capitalized as a lease incentive receivable and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease
term as a reduction to the lease income. The increase in monthly rent was commensurate with the additional space being leased; therefore,
this modification qualifies as a separate contract under ASC 842 which does not require lease classification reassessment. The Company
excludes short-term leases having initial terms of 12-months or less as an accounting policy election and recognizes rent expense on a
straight-lines basis over the lease term. 

and , respectively (see Note 3). Additionally, if the lease provides for
tenant improvements, the Company determines whether the tenant improvements, for accounting purposes, are owned by the tenant or the Company.
When the Company is the owner of the tenant improvements, the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control
of the physical use of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed. When the tenant is the owner of the
tenant improvements, any tenant improvement allowance (including amounts that can be taken in the form of cash or a credit against the
tenant s rent) that is funded is treated as a lease incentive receivable and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease
term.

assets and its ability to pay its operating expenses or pay dividends than if the Company had a diversified property portfolio and service
offerings. The Company s total assets are concentrated into a limited number of tenants who were considered significant tenants.
To the extent that the Company s total assets are concentrated in a limited number of tenants that are in the regulated cannabis
industry, downturns relating generally to such industry or business sector, or a decline in the financial stability of the Company s
Significant Tenants may result in defaults on all of the Company s leases within a short time period, which may reduce the Company s
net income and the value of the Company s common stock and accordingly, limit the Company s ability to pay our operating expenses
or pay dividends to its stockholders. If the Company s tenants are prohibited from operating or cannot pay their rent, the Company
may not have enough working capital to support its operations and the Company would need to consider seeking out new tenants at rental
rates per square foot that may be less than its current rate per square foot.

a Delaware limited liability company formed on May 1, 2021 and owned by the Company. The Company accounts for this investment under
the equity method of accounting as the Company exercises significant influence but does not exercise financial and operating control over
this entity. Investments are reviewed for changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events that suggest an other than temporary event
where the Company s investment may not be recoverable. Currently, the Zoneomics Green team has completed the creation of the foundational
design, technology platform, and market positioning for Zoneomics Green to launch in the cannabis industry. However, in order to successfully
launch, the technology platform relies upon a required merchant banking component. While Company management knew this risk was a major
factor going into the investment, it was not foreseen exactly when an appropriate merchant banking solution would be available given the
federal status of regulated cannabis and specifically the federal banking status as it relates to regulated cannabis, even for ancillary
services such as Zoneomics Green. The regulatory status related to cannabis banking reform and regulation at the federal level, which
the Zoneomics platform relies upon, is uncertain and the Company believes it is appropriate to cause an impairment of the Zoneomics Green
investment at this time, while also understanding that Company believes Zoneomics Green may still create material value for the Company
in the future. Additionally, the Company is using the Zoneomics Green technology within its own business to generate leads for new projects.
The Company has no further financial or investment obligations at this time. Accordingly, on December 31, 2023, the Company recorded an
other-than-temporary impairment loss of because it was determined that the fair value of its equity method investment in Zoneomics
was less than its carrying value. Based on management s evaluation, it was determined that due to market and regulatory conditions,
implementing the Company s business model was at risk and that the Company s ability to recover the carrying amount of the
investment in Zoneomics was impaired.

Item 2: Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information
and Factors That May Affect Future Results 

This quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking
statements regarding our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The Securities and Exchange Commission (the
 SEC encourages companies to disclose forward-looking information so that investors can better understand a company s
future prospects and make informed investment decisions. This quarterly report on Form 10-Q and other written and oral statements that
we make from time to time contain such forward-looking statements that set out anticipated results based on management s plans and
assumptions regarding future events or performance. We have tried, wherever possible, to identify such statements by using words such
as anticipate, estimate, expect, project, intend, plan, 
 believe, will and similar expressions in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance.
In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, future performance or results of current and anticipated sales efforts,
expenses, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, and financial results. Factors that could cause our actual results
of operations and financial condition to differ materially are set forth in the Risk Factors section of our annual report
on Form 10-K as filed on March 26, 2024, as the same may be updated from time to time. 

We caution that these factors could cause our
actual results of operations and financial condition to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements we make
and that investors should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks
only as of the date on which such statement is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect
events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events
or circumstances. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of such factors. Further, we cannot
assess the impact of each such factor on our results of operations or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause
actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. 

The following discussion should be read in conjunction
with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. 

Overview 

Zoned Properties, Inc. Zoned Properties 
or the Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on August 25, 2003. In October 2013, the Company changed its name
to Zoned Properties, Inc. and in April 2014, the Company shifted its business model to address commercial real estate in the regulated
cannabis industry. Zoned Properties is a technology-driven property investment company focused on acquiring value-add real estate within
the regulated cannabis industry in the United States. The Company aspires to innovate within the real estate development sector, focusing
on direct-to-consumer real estate that is leased to the best-in-class cannabis retailers. Headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona, Zoned
Properties is redefining the approach to commercial real estate investment through its standardized investment model backed by its proprietary
property technology. Zoned Properties has developed a national ecosystem of real estate services to support its real estate development
model, including a commercial real estate brokerage and a real estate advisory practice. 

The Company operates in two organized segments;
(1) the operations, leasing and management of its commercial properties, herein known as the Property Investment Portfolio 
segment, and (2) the advisory, brokerage and technology services related to commercial properties, herein known as the Real Estate
Services segment. The Company targets commercial properties that face unique zoning or development challenges, identifies solutions
that can potentially have a major impact on their commercial value, and then works to acquire the properties while securing long-term,
absolute-net leases. The Company does not grow, harvest, sell or distribute cannabis or any substances regulated under United States law
such as the Controlled Substance Act of 1970, as amended (the CSA ). 

32 

The core of our business operations involves identifying,
securing, acquiring, and leasing commercial properties that intend to operate within highly regulated industries, including the legalized
cannabis industry. Within highly regulated industries, local municipalities typically develop strict regulations, including zoning and
permitting requirements related to commercial real estate, that dictate the specific locations and parameters under which regulated properties
can operate, including cannabis properties. We often refer to these requirements as cannabis approvals. These regulations often include
complex permitting processes that require longer development timelines than traditional commercial real estate and can include non-standard
codes governing each location; for example, restricting a regulated property or facility from operating within a certain distance of any
parks, schools, churches, or residential districts, or restricting a regulated property from operating outside a defined set of hours
of operation. When an organization can collaborate with local representatives, a proactive set of rules and regulations can be established
and followed to meet the needs of both the regulated operators and the local community. 

Due to the complex nature of the Company s
core business operations and target investment properties, the Company may secure dozens of potential property candidates for acquisition
and prospective tenant candidates for leasing at any given time, all in the normal course of business. The process of securing a potential
property candidate may include completing contractual agreements such as an option agreement or a purchase agreement, which may include
various contingencies and conditions precedent related to the ultimate consummation of the acquisition, investment, or transaction. Simultaneously
with the securing of potential property candidates, the Company will advertise and market a property to prospective tenant candidates
for a long-term, absolute-net lease agreement, which may include various contingencies and conditions precedent related to the ultimate
commencement of the lease and tenancy. In order to deliver a successful investment property transaction, the Company must collectively
receive all cannabis approvals from state and local governing authorities that may be required at a given property, secure a qualified
tenant to lease and operate the property, and complete the acquisition of the property. 

The Company s current investment properties
are located in Arizona, Illinois, and Michigan with 100 occupancy and a weighted average lease term over 10 years. Each of the Company s
leased properties is occupied by a commercial cannabis tenant. 

Zoned Properties maintains a portfolio of properties
that it owns, develops and leases. As of September 30, 2024, the Company leases land and/or building space at the six properties in its
portfolio to licensed and regulated cannabis tenants in areas with established cannabis regulations and zoning procedures. Four of the
leased properties are zoned and permitted as regulated cannabis retail dispensaries, and two of the leased properties are zoned and permitted
as regulated cannabis cultivation and processing facilities. The Company considers the two cultivation sites in its portfolio as legacy
properties, and may consider selling or leveraging those properties to unlock equity and create capital availability in the future. The
Zoned Properties investment thesis has evolved over the years as the cannabis industry has emerged, and is currently focused on investing
capital into direct-to-consumer properties, located in state-markets with robust cannabis consumer demand in the industry.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Liquidity is the ability of an enterprise to generate
adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs for cash requirements. We had cash of 1,152,090 and 3,099,795 as of September 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023, respectively. 

Our primary uses of cash have been for the acquisition
of new property investments, compensation and benefits, fees paid to third parties for professional services, real estate taxes, general
and administrative expenses, and the development of rental properties and other lines of business. All funds received have been expended
in the furtherance of growing the business. We receive funds from the collection of rental income, and real estate services, which primarily
includes advisory fees and brokerage fees. The following trends are reasonably likely to result in changes in our liquidity over the near
to long term: 

An increase in working capital requirements to finance our current business, 

Addition of administrative and sales personnel as the business grows, 

The cost of being a public company, 

An increase in investments in joint ventures and other projects, and 

An increase in investments in rental properties. 

We may need to raise additional funds, particularly
if we are unable to continue to generate positive cash flows from our operations. We estimate that based on current plans and assumptions,
that our available cash will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements under our present operating expectations for the next 12 months
from the date of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Other than revenue received from the lease of our rental properties and real estate
services, and from a bank note, we presently have no other significant alternative source of working capital. 

We have used these funds to fund our operating
expenses, pay our obligations, acquire and develop rental properties, invest in joint ventures and notes receivable, and to grow our company.
We may need to raise significant additional capital or debt financing to acquire new properties, to develop existing properties, to assure
we have sufficient working capital for our ongoing operations and debt obligations, and to invest in new joint venture and other projects. 

Recent Property Acquisitions and Related Note
Payables 

On July 8, 2024 (the Closing ), ZP
Dysart acquired a property in Surprise AZ (the Surprise Property from NWC Dysart Bell LLC NWC ). Surprise

and as approved by NWC under the terms of the Agreement, ZPRE Holdings designated ZP Dysart as the named buyer for the Closing. 

38 

In connection with the Surprise Property Closing,
ZP Dysart entered into the Construction Loan Agreement (the PMF Loan Agreement ), dated as of July 8, 2024, by and between
ZP Dysart and Private Money Funding, LLC PMF ). Pursuant to the terms of the PMF Loan Agreement, PMF agreed to loan up to
 1,620,000 to ZP Dysart, which loan is evidenced by a promissory note (the PMF Note ). ZP Dysart s obligations under
the PMF Note and the PMF Loan Agreement are secured by a Deed of Trust, Assignment of Leases and Rents, Security Agreement and Fixture
Filing (the PMF Deed ). The PMF Loan Agreement, the PMF Note, any guaranties, and all other related documents executed and
delivered concurrently with the PMF Loan Agreement are referred to herein as the PMF Loan Documents. Pursuant to the terms
of the PMF Loan Agreement, on July 8, 2024, ZP Dysart issued the PMF Note with the maximum principal amount of 1,620,000 to PMF (the
 Maximum Amount ). Interest accrues at the rate of 12 per annum, with ZP Dysart paying interest only in arrears, in monthly
installment payments, beginning on August 1, 2024 through July 1, 2029 (the Maturity Date ). ZP Dysart may prepay the PMF
Loan in full or in part at any time. However, during the first 48 months of the term of the loan, if ZP Dysart pays any principal payment,
ZP Dysart will pay to PMF a prepayment premium equal to (i) 5 of the amount of principal prepaid in months 1-24; (ii) 2 of the amount
of principal prepaid in months 25-36; and (iii) 1 of the amount of principal prepaid in months 36-48, which amount will be due and payable
at the time ZP Dysart pays the principal payment. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company borrowed 1,020,000 of
the Maximum Amount and received net proceeds of 983,940, net of origination fees and costs of 36,060. As of September 30, 2024, the
principal amount of the loan is 1,020,000 and accrued interest payable amounted to 10,200. 

During the existence of any event of default,
PMF may, at its option, exercise any one or more of the remedies described in the PMF Loan Documents or otherwise available, including
declaring all unpaid indebtedness then evidenced by the Note (including any late charges that are then due and payable, any advances thereafter
made from the loan and any accruing costs and reasonable attorneys fees which are the obligation of ZP Dysart under the PMF Loan
Documents) to become immediately due and payable. Unless PMF otherwise elects, such acceleration will occur automatically upon the occurrence
of any event of default described in PMF Loan Agreement or PMF Deed. 

After maturity or during the existence of any
event of default, or at any time that ZP Dysart is more than 10 days delinquent in the payment of money as required by the Note or the
other Loan Documents (whether or not Holder has given any notice of default or any cure period has expired), then all amounts outstanding
thereunder will thereafter bear interest at the default rate of 18 per annum from the date such payment became due until paid, but in
no event to exceed the highest rate lawfully collectible under applicable law. 

Pursuant to the terms of the PMF Loan Agreement,
following ZP Dysart s satisfaction of the conditions to funding the PMF Loan and recordation of the PMF Deed, the loan proceeds
will be disbursed in multiple advances through escrow, first in the form of an initial advance in the amount of 1,020,000 for the purpose
of contributing funding towards acquiring the Surprise Property (the Acquisition Advance ). The remaining loan proceeds will
be used for the purpose of financing for the completion of Sunday Goods Work (as hereinafter defined) (the Construction
Advances ). Following the Acquisition Advance, subject to satisfying the conditions set forth in the PMF Loan Agreement, ZP Dysart
will be entitled to request the Construction Advances from the remaining loan proceeds at the following stages of completion of the construction
of Sunday Goods Work: (i) first advance in the amount of 300,000 at 50 completion, and (ii) final advance in the amount of 300,000
at 100 completion and issuance of certificate of occupancy. 

The PMF Loan Agreement contains representations,
warranties and covenants customary for a transaction of this type. 

Pursuant to the terms of the Unconditional Repayment
Guaranty (the PMF Guaranty ), dated as of July 8, 2024, by Zoned Properties, Inc. in favor of PMF, the Company guaranteed
to PMF the full and prompt payment of the principal sum of the PMF Note or so much thereof that may be outstanding at any one time or
from time to time in accordance with its terms when due, by acceleration or otherwise, together with all interest accrued thereon, and
the full and prompt payment of all other sums, together with all interest accrued thereon, when due under the terms of the PMF Loan Agreement,
the PMF Note, and in any deed of trust, security agreement, lease assignment and other assignment or agreement referred to in the PMF
Loan Agreement or the PMF Note and/or now or hereafter securing the PMF Note or setting forth any obligations of ZP Dysart in connection
with the loan. 

39 

We may secure additional financing to acquire
and develop additional and existing properties. Financing transactions may include the issuance of equity or debt securities, obtaining
credit facilities, or other financing mechanisms. Even if we are able to raise the funds required, it is possible that we could incur
unexpected costs and expenses or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek alternative financing. Furthermore,
if we issue additional equity or debt securities, stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have
rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock. The inability to obtain additional capital
may restrict our ability to grow our business operations.

Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements 

Contractual Obligations 

We have certain fixed contractual obligations
and commitments that include future estimated payments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions, changing interest rates,
and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts
of payments. We have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the
tables, in order to assist in the review of this information within the context of our consolidated financial position, results of operations,
and cash flows. 

The following tables summarize our contractual
obligations as of September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands), and the effect these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and
cash flows in future periods.

Off-balance Sheet Arrangements 

Other than discussed below, we have not entered
into any other financial guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any third parties. We have not entered
into any derivative contracts that are indexed to our shares and classified as shareholders equity. Furthermore, we do not have
any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk
support to such entity. We do not have any variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk
or credit support to us or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us. Our off-balance sheet arrangement
includes the notional amount of our interest rate swaps which we use to hedge a portion of our exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Currently, our interest rate swap fixes the variable rate interest on our bank swap note payable. We intend to fund our interest rate
swap payments utilizing cash flows from operations. As of September 30, 2024, the notional amount of our interest rate swaps was 4,429,704.
In interest rate swaps, the notional amount is the specified value upon which interest rate payments will be exchanged. The notional amount
in interest rate swaps is used to come up with the amount of interest due.

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition
and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates
and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities. We continually evaluate our estimates, including the critical ones related to an interest rate swap, the allowance for
accounts receivable, impairment of rental properties, and the valuation of equity transactions. We base our estimates on historical experience
and on various other assumptions that we believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Any future changes to
these estimates and assumptions could cause a material change to our reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. Actual
results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting estimates
affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements. 

Interest rate swap 

In connection with a bank loan executed in 2022,
the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage interest rate risk related to debt that accrues interest at variable
rates. The Company accounts for its interest rate swap agreement in accordance with the guidance related to derivatives and hedging activities.
The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates. The Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference
between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount. Interest payments receivable
and payable under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement are accrued over the period to which the payment relates and the net difference
is treated as an adjustment of interest expense related to the underlying liability. Because the variable interest rates used to calculate
payments under the terms of the swap agreement are calculated using different benchmarks than those included in the Company s variable
rate debt agreement, the swap agreement is not considered an effective cash flow hedge. 

Accordingly, changes in the underlying market
value of the remaining swap payments are recognized into income as an increase or decrease to other income (expense) each reporting period.
In accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , the Company believes values provided by its counterparty represent
the fair value of its swap agreement. The Company believes that the quality of the counterparty to its swap agreement mitigates the counterparty
credit risk. 

The estimated fair value of the interest rate
swap agreement is reflected as a derivative liability on the accompanying balance sheets with changes in the fair value reflected in income
(loss) from derivative - interest rate swap on the accompanying statements of operations. The Company uses derivative financial instruments
only to manage interest rate risks and not as investment vehicles. 

Information regarding the interest rate swap is as follows:

 Notional Amount on September 30, 2024

 Fair Value of Liability on September 30, 2024 
 Fair Value of Liability on December 31, 2023

 4,429,704 
 7.65 
 December 10, 2032 
 175,382 
 122,879 

42 

Accounts receivable 

We recognize an allowance for losses on accounts
receivable in an amount equal to the estimated probable losses net of recoveries under the current expected credit loss method. The allowance
is based on an analysis of historical bad debt experience, current receivables aging and expected future write-offs, as well as an assessment
of specific identifiable customer accounts receivable considered at risk or uncollectible. On January 1, 2023, we adopted ASC 326, Financial
Instruments - Credit Losses . In accordance with ASC 326, an allowance is maintained for estimated forward-looking losses resulting
from the possible inability of customers to make required payments (current expected losses). The amount of the allowance is determined
principally on the basis of past collection experience and known financial factors regarding specific customers. The expense associated
with the allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivable is recognized in general and administrative expenses. 

Rental properties 

Rental properties are carried at cost less accumulated
depreciation and amortization. Betterments, major renovations and certain costs directly related to the improvement of rental properties
are capitalized. Maintenance and repair expenses are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis
over estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 5 to 39 years. Tenant improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis
over the lives of the related leases, which approximate the useful lives of the assets. 

Upon the acquisition of real estate, we assess
the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings and improvements, identified intangibles, such as acquired above-market leases
and acquired in-place leases) and acquired liabilities (such as acquired below-market leases) and allocate the purchase price based on
these assessments. The Company assesses fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization
rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating
results, known trends, and market/economic conditions. 

Our properties are individually reviewed for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment exists
when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the aggregate projected future cash flows over the anticipated holding period on an undiscounted
basis. An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the property s carrying amount over its estimated fair value. Impairment
analyses are based on our current plans, intended holding periods and available market information at the time the analyses are prepared.
If our estimates of the projected future cash flows, anticipated holding periods, or market conditions change, our evaluation of impairment
losses may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. The evaluation of anticipated
cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that
could differ materially from actual results. 

Impairment occurs when the carrying amount of
our rental properties exceeds its recoverable amount. For our rental property, we considered the recoverable amount to be the respective
properties fair value less costs to sell (FVLCS) plus its value in use (VIU). The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset s
fair value less costs to sell (FVLCS) and its value in use (VIU). FVLCS and VIU as defined as follows: 

Fair
Value Less Costs to Sell (FVLCS): 

Fair
value is typically determined by market prices or appraisals or tax value. 

Subtract
any costs that would be incurred to sell the asset (like commissions). 

Value
in Use (VIU): 

This
is the present value of the future cash flows the asset is expected to generate. 

Cash
flows should be based on leases in place. 

We have capitalized land, which is not subject
to depreciation. 

43 

Stock-based compensation 

Stock-based compensation is accounted for based
on the requirements of ASC 718 Compensation Stock Compensation , which requires recognition in the
financial statements of the cost of employee, director, and non-employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments
over the period the employee, director, or non-employee is required to perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively,
the vesting period). The ASC also requires measurement of the cost of employee, director, and non-employee services received in exchange
for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The Company has elected to recognize forfeitures as they occur as permitted
under ASU 2016-09 Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting . Assumptions used in the estimation of stock-based grants
may include the volatility of our common stock, expected term of exercise, our discount rate and our dividend rate. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

Management does not believe that recently issued,
but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk 

Not applicable to smaller reporting companies. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, 
as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e), promulgated by the SEC pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange
Act ). Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in our company s reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the participation
of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated our company s disclosure controls and procedures as
of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. 

The ineffectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures was due to the following material weaknesses which we identified in our internal control over financial reporting: (1)
the lack of multiples levels of management review on complex accounting and financial reporting issues, (2) we had not implemented adequate
system and manual controls, and (3) a lack of adequate segregation of duties and necessary corporate accounting resources in our financial
reporting process and accounting function as a result of our limited financial resources to support hiring of personnel and implementation
of accounting systems. Until such time as we expand our staff to include additional accounting personnel and hire a full-time chief financial
officer, it is likely we will continue to report material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. 

Changes in Internal Control 

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
