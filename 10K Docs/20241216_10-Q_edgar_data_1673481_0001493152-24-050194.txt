CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10Q (this Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the Exchange Act ), including statements about the financial condition, results of operations, earnings outlook and prospects
of Lottery.com Inc. Lottery.com , the Company , we or us ). Forward-looking statements
appear in a number of places in this Report, including, without limitation, under the heading in Part I, Item 2. Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. In addition, any statements that refer to projections,
forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as plan, believe, expect, 
 anticipate, intend, outlook, estimate, forecast, project, 
 continue, could, may, might, possible, potential, 
 predict, should, would and other similar words and expressions, but the absence of these words
does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. 

Forward-looking
statements are based on the current expectations of the management of Lottery.com and are inherently subject to uncertainties and changes
in circumstances and their potential effects and speak only as of the date of such statement. There can be no assurance that future developments
will be those that have been anticipated. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties or other assumptions
that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.
These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors discussed and identified in the section entitled Risk
Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the Amended Annual Report which
was filed on May 20, 2024 and in this Report, as such factors may be updated in our periodic reports filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), as well as the following: 

The
 findings of the previously disclosed Internal Investigation (as defined herein) and other
 matters have exposed us to a number of legal proceedings, investigations and inquiries, resulted
 in significant legal and other expenses, required significant time and attention from our
 senior management, among other adverse impacts. 

We
 and certain of our former officers are, and in the future, we or our officers and directors
 may become, the subject of legal proceedings, investigations and inquiries by governmental
 agencies with respect to the findings of the Internal Investigation and other matters, which
 could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, cash
 flows and results of operations, and could result in additional claims and material liabilities. 

We
 have been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits filed by purchasers of our securities,
 including class action lawsuits that could have a material adverse impact on our business,
 financial condition, results of operation and cash flows, and our reputation. 

Matters
 relating to or arising from the restatement and the Internal Investigation, including adverse
 publicity and potential concerns from our users, customers or others with whom we do business,
 have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. 

In
 July 2022, we furloughed the majority of our employees and suspended our lottery game sales
 operations after determining that we did not have sufficient financial resources to fund
 our operations or pay certain existing obligations, including our payroll and related obligations.
 As a result, we may not be able to continue as a going concern. 

We
 need additional capital to, among other things, support and restart our operations, re-hire
 employees and pay our expenses. Such capital may not be available on commercially acceptable
 terms, if at all. If we do not receive the additional capital, we may be forced to curtail
 or abandon our plans to recommence our operations and we may need to permanently cease our
 operations. 

ii 

If
 we fail to implement and maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may be unable
 to accurately report our results of operations, meet our reporting obligations or prevent
 fraud, and investor confidence and the trading price of our common stock and warrants may
 be materially and adversely affected. 

The
 circumstances that led to the failure to file our annual report and quarterly reports on
 time, and our efforts to investigate, assess and remediate those matters have caused and
 may continue to cause substantial delays in our SEC filings. 

Our
 inability to compete with other forms of entertainment for consumers discretionary
 time and income. 

Economic
 downturns, inflation, geopolitical and political and market conditions beyond our control. 

Negative
 events or media coverage relating to our business, our management and directors, the lottery,
 lottery games or online gaming or betting. 

Our
 inability to attract and retain users, including as a result of failing to appear in Internet
 search engine results. 

Our
 continued ability to use domain names to promote and increase the value of our brand. 

Scrutiny
 by stakeholders with respect to responsible gaming and ethical conduct. 

Our
 ability to achieve profitability and growth in the newly-developed market for online lottery
 games. 

Our
 inability to profitably expand into new markets or capitalize on new gaming and lottery industry
 trends and changes, such as by developing successful new product offerings. 

The
 effectiveness of our marketing efforts in developing and maintaining our brand and reputation. 

Failure
 to offer high-quality user support. 

Adverse
 impacts to user relationships resulting from disruptions to our information technology. 

The
 vulnerability of our information systems to cyberattacks and disruptions caused with respect
 thereto, including an inability to securely maintain personal and other proprietary user
 information. 

Our
 inability to adapt to changes or updates in the Internet, mobile or personal devices, or
 new technology platforms or network infrastructures. 

The
 exposure of our online infrastructure to risks relating to new and untested distributed ledger
 technology. 

Our
 inability to comply with complex, ever-changing and multi-jurisdictional regulatory regimes
 and other legal requirements applicable to the gaming and lottery industries. 

Geopolitical
 shifts and changes in applicable laws or regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted. 

Our
 inability to successfully expand geographically and acquire and integrate new operations. 

Our
 dependence on third-party service providers to timely perform services or software component
 products for our gaming platforms, product offerings and the processing of user payments
 and withdrawals. 

Our
 inability to maintain successful relationships and/or agreements with lottery organizations
 and other third-party marketing or service provider affiliates. 

iii 

Failure
 of third-party service providers to protect, enforce, or defend intellectual property rights
 required to fulfill contractual obligations necessary for the operation of our business. 

The
 effectiveness of our transition and compliance with the regulatory and other requirements
 of being a newly public company. 

We
 are currently not in compliance with the minimum share price of 1.00 and the minimum market
 value of 5 million as required by Nasdaq Continued Listing Standards and we have had periods
 of non-compliance in the past and we may not be able to regain compliance with Nasdaq s
 continued listing standards in the future. 

Limited
 liquidity and trading of our securities. 

Lenders
 may not loan us the amounts they agreed to under existing Loan Agreements. 

Our
 obligations under certain loan agreements are secured by a first priority security interest
 in substantially all of our assets and if we were to default, we could be required to curtail
 or abandon our business plans and operations. 

The
 issuance and sale of common stock upon conversion of the amounts owed or upon exercise of
 the warrants issued to Woodford, UCIL, or Univest (as defined herein) under their loan agreements
 may depress the market price of our common stock and cause substantial dilution. 

We
 currently owe a significant amount of money under our loan agreements, which we may not be
 able to repay. 

The
risks described herein or in the Risk Factors sections of our other public filings referenced above are not exhaustive.
Other sections of this Report describe additional factors that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of
operations. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict all such risk factors, nor can we assess the
impact of all such risk factors on our business, or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results
to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance.
You should not put undue reliance on these statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. All forward-looking statements attributable
to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing cautionary statements. We undertake
no obligations to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or
otherwise, except as required by law.

NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

NINE
MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 

million on
September 30, 2024. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the company sustained a loss of million. For the year ending December
31, 2023 the company sustained a net loss of million. The Company sustained a loss from operations of million and million
for the years ending December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Subsequently, the Company sustained additional operating losses and anticipates
additional operating losses for the next twelve months. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to
continue as a going concern. 

The
Company has historically funded its activities almost exclusively from debt and equity financing. Management s plans in order to
meet its operating cash flow requirements include financing activities such as private placements of its common stock, preferred stock
offerings, and issuances of debt and convertible debt. Although Management believes that it will be able to continue to raise funds by
sale of its securities to provide the additional cash needed to meet the Company s obligations as they become due beginning with
a loan agreement the Company entered into with United Capital Investments Ltd. UCIL on July 21, 2023, the Plans for Recommencement
of Company Operations require substantial funds to implement and there is no assurance that the Company will be able to continue raising
the required capital. 

The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements depends
on its ability to execute the business plan for the relaunch of its core business, the successful monetization of Sports.com, and keeping
expenditures in line with available operating capital. Such conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern. 

We
determined that our Chief Financial Officer is the Chief Operating Decision Maker, and he uses financial information, business prospects,
competitive factors, operating results and other non-U.S. GAAP financial ratios to evaluate our performance, which is the same basis
on which our results and performance are communicated to our Board of Directors. Based on the information described above and in accordance
with the applicable literature, management has concluded that we are organized and operated as one operating and reportable segment on
a consolidated basis for each of the periods presented.

Management believes the risk of loss in connection with these accounts is minimal.

. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated
useful life of the asset. Routine maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred. The costs of major additions, replacements and
improvements are capitalized. Gains and losses realized on the sale or disposal of property and equipment are recognized or charged to
other expense in the consolidated statement of operations.

Other
associated revenue 

The
Company s performance obligations in agreements with certain customers are to provide a license of intellectual property related
to the use of the Company s tradename for marketing purposes by partners of the Company. Customers pay a license fee up front.
The transaction price is deemed to be the license issue fee stated in the contract. The license offered by the Company represents a symbolic
license which provides the customer with the right to use the Company s intellectual property on an ongoing basis with continued
support throughout the term of the contract in the form of ongoing maintenance of the underlying intellectual property. There is no variable
consideration related to these performance obligations. 

Arrangements
with multiple performance obligations 

The
Company s contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, management allocates revenue
to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Management generally determines standalone selling prices
based on the prices charged to customers. 

Deferred
Revenue 

The
Company records deferred revenue when cash payments are received or due in advance of any performance, including amounts which are refundable. 

Payment
terms vary by the type and location of the customer and the products or services offered. The term between invoicing and when payment
is due is not significant. For certain products or services and customer types, management requires payment before the products or services
are delivered to the customer. 

Contract
Assets 

Given
the nature of the Company s services and contracts, it has no contract assets. 

Taxes 

Taxes
assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions, that are collected
by us from a customer, are excluded from revenue. 

The Company s
policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes as a component of income tax expense or benefit.
To date, there have been no interest or penalties charged in relation to the unrecognized tax benefits. 

Generally,
the taxing authorities can audit the previous three years of tax returns and in certain situations audit additional years. For federal
tax purposes, the Company s 2020 through 2023 tax years generally remain open for examination by the tax authorities under the
normal three-year statute of limitations. For state tax purposes, the Company s 2019 through 2023 tax years remain open for examination
by the tax authorities under the normal four-year statute of limitations. 

The
classification of an asset or liability in the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement
of fair value.

Nasdaq
Listing 

On
March 23, 2023, the Company requested a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the Panel to appeal a determination
by the Listing Qualifications department (the Staff of Nasdaq dated February 23, 2023, to delist the Company s securities
from Nasdaq. At the hearing before the Panel on April 24, 2023, the Company presented its plan to complete the restatement of its financial
statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, and the subsequent quarter ended March 31, 2022, and to file the amended periodic
reports and all subsequent required filings with the SEC. The Company requested the continued listing of its securities on Nasdaq pending
the completion of its compliance plan. 

By
letter dated May 8, 2023, the Panel granted the Company s request for continued listing, on an interim basis, subject to the Company
submitting financial projections for fiscal 2023 and filing the restated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2021, and quarter ended March 31, 2022, with the SEC by May 15, 2023. The Company satisfied these conditions and the Panel indicated
that it would review the filings, along with the updated projections, and thereafter determine whether to afford the Company additional
time to complete the compliance plan presented at the hearing. 

By
letter dated May 24, 2023, the Panel notified the Company that it had determined to suspend trading and otherwise move to delist the
Company s securities from Nasdaq effective with the open of the market on May 26, 2023. The Company s securities were suspended
from trading on that date, but the securities were not delisted because the Company thereafter requested that the Panel reconsider its
determination to delist the Company s securities from Nasdaq based upon what the Company believed to be mistakes of material fact
upon which the Panel had based its decision. 

On
June 8, 2023, the Panel notified the Company that it had determined to reverse its prior decision and grant the Company s request
for continued listing subject to the Company s timely compliance with a number of conditions ultimately expiring on August 17,
2023, on which date the Company must satisfy all applicable criteria for continued listing on Nasdaq (the June 8 th
 Decision ). As a result of the foregoing, the suspension from trading ceased and the Company s securities were reinstated
for trading on Nasdaq effective with the open of the market on June 15, 2023. See Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Common
Stock and Warrants We are not currently in full compliance with the continued listing standards of Nasdaq. and, we may not be
able to regain full compliance with Nasdaq s continued listing standards in the future for more information. 

As
reported on form 8-K filed on December 7, 2023, on November 29, 2023, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq stating that based upon
its review of the Company s Market Value of Publicly Held Shares MVPHS for the last 30 consecutive business days,
the Company no longer met the minimum requirement of 5,000,000 set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b)(1)(C). However, under the Listing
Rules, the Company was provided a 180-calendar day grace period to regain compliance, through May 28, 2024. 

If
at any time during the compliance period the Company s MVPHS closed at 5,000,000 or more for a minimum of ten consecutive business
days, Nasdaq would provide written confirmation of compliance, and the matter would be closed. The company received such notification
from Nasdaq on April 10, 2024 and the matter was closed. 

Furthermore,
the requirement that we maintain a majority of independent directors and at least three members on our audit committee are Nasdaq requirements
that we currently meet but have not met from time to time. 

As
of the date of this Report, we are currently not in full compliance with the continued listing standards of Nasdaq, and we may not be
able to regain full compliance with Nasdaq s continued listing standards in the future. Our common stock and warrants trade on
The Nasdaq Global Market under the symbols LTRY and LTRYW, respectively. Our failure to regain full compliance
with all these requirements may result in our securities being delisted from Nasdaq. 

As
of the date of this Report, our common stock is trading below Nasdaq s 1.00 (U.S.) minimum trading price requirement (the Minimum
Trading Price ), an minimum trading price that was breached on July 30, 2024. Should the Minimum Trading Price not be restored,
the Company risks having its securities delisted by Nasdaq. 

If
the Company s securities are delisted from Nasdaq, it could be more difficult to buy and sell the Company s common stock
and warrants or to obtain accurate quotations, and the price of the Company s common stock and warrants could suffer a material
decline. Delisting could also impair the Company s ability to raise capital and/or trigger defaults and penalties under its outstanding
agreements or securities. Further, even if we lose and are able to regain compliance with Nasdaq listing requirements, there is no guarantee
that we will be able to maintain our listing for any period of time. 

Delisting
from Nasdaq could also result in negative publicity. Further, if we are delisted, we would also incur additional costs under state blue
sky laws in connection with any sales of our securities. These requirements could severely limit the market liquidity of our common stock
and/or warrants and the ability of our stockholders to sell our common stock and/or warrants in the secondary market. If our common stock
and/or warrants are delisted by Nasdaq, our common stock and/or warrants may be eligible to trade on an over-the-counter quotation system,
such as the OTCQB Market, where an investor may find it more difficult to sell our stock or obtain accurate quotations as to the market
value of our common stock and/or warrants. In the event our common stock and/or warrants are delisted from The Nasdaq Global Market,
we may not be able to list our common stock and/or warrants on another national securities exchange or obtain quotation on an over-the
counter quotation system.

limitation and a separate limitation preventing Woodford from holding more than 19.99 of the issued and outstanding common stock of
the Company, without the Company obtaining shareholder approval for such issuance. 

Conditions
to the Woodford Loan Agreement included the resignation of four prior members of the Board (Lisa Borders, Steven M. Cohen, Lawrence Anthony
DiMatteo and William Thompson, all of whom resigned from the Board in September 2022), and the appointment of two new independent directors.
Subsequent loans under the Woodford Loan Agreement also required the Company to comply with all listing requirements, unless waived by
Woodford. The Woodford Loan Agreement also allowed Woodford to nominate another director to the Board of Directors, in the event any
independent member of the Board of Directors resigned. 

Proceeds
of the loans could only be used to restart the Company s operations and for general corporate purposes agreed to by Woodford. 

The
Woodford Loan Agreement included confidentiality obligations, representations, warranties, covenants, and events of default, which are
customary for a transaction of this size and nature. Included in the Loan Agreement are covenants prohibiting us from (a) making any
loan in excess of 1 million or obtaining any loan in an amount exceeding 1 million without the consent of Woodford, which consent may
not be unreasonably withheld; (b) selling more than 1 million in assets; (c) maintaining less than enough assets to perform our obligations
under the Loan Agreement; (d) encumbering any assets, except in the normal course of business, and not in an amount to exceed 1 million;
(e) amending or restating our governing documents; (f) declaring or paying any dividend; (g) issuing any shares which negatively affects
Woodford; and (h) repurchasing any shares. 

The
Company also agreed to grant warrants to purchase shares of common stock to Woodford (the Woodford Warrants in an amount
equal to 15 of the Company s then issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Each Woodford Warrant has an exercise price equal
to the average of the closing price of the Company s common stock for each of the ten days prior to the first amount being debited
from the bank account of Woodford, which equates to an exercise price of 5.60 per share. In the event the Company fails to repay the
amounts borrowed when due or Woodford fails to convert the amount owed into shares, the exercise price of the warrants may be offset
by amounts owed to Woodford, and in such case, the exercise price of the warrants will be subject to a further 25 discount. 

In
connection with our entry into the Woodford Loan Agreement, the Company also entered into a Loan Agreement Deed, Debenture Deed and Securitization,
with Woodford (the Security Agreement ), which provides Woodford with a first floating charge security interest over all
present and future assets of the Company in order to secure the repayment of amounts owed under the Loan Agreement. 

On
June 12, 2023, the Company entered into an amendment of the Woodford Loan Agreement (the Woodford Loan Agreement Amendment ).
The Woodford Loan Agreement Amendment provides that Woodford shall henceforth be able to convert, in whole or in part, the outstanding
balance of its loan into the conversion shares at a conversion price that represents a further 25 discount to the original conversion
price of 20 . The validity and application of the Woodford Loan Agreement Amendment is disputed by the Company. 

Despite
requests from the Company, Woodford has repeatedly among other things: failed to prove the amounts borrowed by the Company or claimed
to have been advanced by Woodford to the Company; failed to indicate if it would accept accelerated payment of those verified amounts;
failed to provide an anti-money laundering acceptable account to which payment could be made by the Company and failed to explain failure
to respond to requests for other funding to be accepted in the context of the Woodford Loan Agreement; failed to respond to requests
for funding under the accordion facility of the Woodford Loan Agreement; and failed to respond to allegations of money laundering and
conspiracy to defraud the Company and the matter has been referred to the Company s legal counsel. 

Information
regarding ongoing legal proceedings with Woodford can be found in the Legal Proceedings section of this form.

Loan
Agreement with United Capital Investments London Limited 

The
Company entered into a credit facility (the UCIL Credit Facility ), which is represented by a loan agreement, which was
initially entered into on July 26, 2023, and was amended and restated on August 8, 2023, and subsequently amended on August 18, 2023
and amended and restated on February 16, 2024, the UCIL Loan Agreement ). The UCIL Loan Agreement is with United Capital
Investments London Limited UCIL ), an entity in which each of Matthew McGahan, the Company s Chief Executive Officer
and Chair of the Company s Board, and Barney Battles, a former member of the Board, have a direct or indirect interest. The decision
by the Company to enter into the UCIL Loan Agreement followed an acknowledgment by the Company that it had not received the requisite
funding on a timely basis that it expected from Woodford, despite the Company making several requests to Woodford for said funding under
the Woodford Loan Agreement. Moreover, the Board of Directors determined that it was in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders
to enter into the UCIL Loan Agreement with UCIL, as an alternative lender to Woodford, upon receiving an event of default notice on July
21, 2023 (the Default Notice and an event of default and crystallization notice on July 25, 2023 (the Crystallization
Notice from Woodford under the Woodford Loan Agreement. Neither McGahan or Battles participated in the vote on the UCIL agreement
to ensure proper independence and correct corporate governance. On July 24, 2023, the Company responded to the Default Notice disputing
that an event of default had occurred given the Company s earlier announcement that UCIL had agreed to enter into a funding arrangement
with the Company. On July 27, 2023, the Company replied to the Crystallization Notice denying that an event of default occurred or continued,
and further asserted that Woodford s attempt for crystallization was inappropriate and unlawful under the Woodford Loan Agreement.
Given the protracted uncertainty of the continued financing under the Woodford Loan Agreement, the Board of Directors sought to secure
and formalize the Company s alternative funding by entering into the UCIL Loan Agreement. 

A total of 697,000 has been received
from UCIL. 682,000 has been converted from debt to equity and the balance as of September 30, 2024 for investors placed by UCIL is 15,000.

the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split, every 20 shares of common stock either issued and outstanding or held as treasury stock
were automatically combined into one issued and outstanding share of common stock, without any change in the par value per share. Stockholders
who would have otherwise been entitled to fractional shares of common stock as a result of the Reverse Stock Split received a cash payment
in lieu of receiving fractional shares. In addition, as a result of the Reverse Stock Split, proportionate adjustments will be made to
the number of shares of common stock underlying the Company s outstanding equity awards, the number of shares issuable upon the
exercise of the Company s outstanding warrants and the number of shares issuable under the Company s equity incentive plans
and certain existing agreements, as well as the exercise, grant and acquisition prices of such equity awards and warrants, as applicable.
The Reverse Stock Split was approved by the Company s stockholders at the Company s 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders on

effects of the Reverse Stock Split have been reflected in this Amended Quarterly Report on Form 10Q for all periods presented. 

International
Expansion 

In
June 2021, we closed the acquisition of Global Gaming, which holds 80 of the equity of each of Aganar and JuegaLotto. Aganar operates
in the licensed Online Lottery market in Mexico and is licensed to sell Mexican National Lottery draw games, instant win tickets, and
other games of chance online with access to a federally approved online casino and sportsbook gaming license. JuegaLotto is licensed
by Mexico authorities to commercialize international lottery games in Mexico through an authorized gaming portal and to commercialize
games of chance in other countries throughout Latin America. As of the date of this Report, according to Statista, the estimated size
of the Latin American lottery market is 0.68 billion with a compound annual growth rate projected at 6.05 through 2028. Furthermore,
it is projected that there will be 3,000,000 online lottery players in the South American lottery market alone by 2028. Based on these
projections, we believe these acquisitions provide opportunities for growth of our international operations throughout Mexico and Latin
America as we expand our portfolio of products and expose our existing products to new markets.

Operations
Prior to Operational Cessation 

Prior
to the Operational Cessation, the Company was a provider of domestic and international lottery products and services. As an independent
third-party lottery game service, we offered a platform that we developed and operated to enable the remote purchase of legally sanctioned
lottery games in the U.S. and abroad (the Platform ). Our revenue generating activities included (i) offering the Platform
via our Lottery.com app and our websites to users located in the U.S. and international jurisdictions where the sale of lottery games
was legal and our services were enabled for the remote purchase of legally sanctioned lottery games (our B2C Platform 
(ii) offering an internally developed, created and operated business-to-business application programming interface API of the Platform, which enabled our commercial partners, in permitted U.S. and international jurisdictions, to purchase certain legally
operated lottery games from us and to resell them to users located within their respective jurisdictions B2B API and
(iii) delivering global lottery data, such as winning numbers and results, and subscriptions to data sets of our proprietary, anonymized
transaction data pursuant to multi-year contracts to commercial digital subscribers Data Service ). 

Mobile
Lottery Game Platform Services 

Both
our B2C Platform and our B2B API provided users with the ability to purchase legally sanctioned draw lottery games via a mobile device
or computer, securely maintain their acquired lottery game, automatically redeem a winning lottery game, as applicable, and receive support,
if required, for the claims and redemption process. Our registration and user interfaces were designed to be easy to use, provide for
the creation of an account and purchase of a lottery game with minimum friction and without the creation of a mobile wallet or requirement
to pre-load minimum funds and - importantly - to provide instant confirmation of the user s lottery game numbers, whether selected
at random or picked by the user. Users of our B2C Platform services paid a service fee and, in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, a mark-up
on the purchase price. Prior to the Operational Cessation, we generated revenue from this service fee and mark-up. Our B2B API Platform
resumed limited operations for the month of April 2023. As of the date of this Report, our B2C Platform is not currently available to
the public. We anticipate that our B2C Platform will become available again in early 2025. 

The
WinTogether Platform 

Prior
to the Operational Cessation, we operated and administered of all sweepstakes offered by WinTogether, a registered 501(c)(3) charitable
organization WinTogether ), which was formed in April 2020 to support charitable, educational, and scientific causes. In
consideration of our operation of the WinTogether platform and administration of the sweepstakes, we received a percentage of the gross
donations to a campaign, from which we paid certain dividends and all administration costs. 

The
WinTogether platform continued operating after the Operational Cessation, until all sweepstakes campaigns were completed, and all prizes
awarded. On March 29, 2023, the board of directors of WinTogether voted to suspend its relationship with the Company. The suspension
of the relationship was rescinded by the WinTogether board on November 16, 2023. 

On
April 1, 2024, Lottery.com resumed its sweepstakes offerings through its partnership with the WinTogether.org foundation (DBA:
DonateTo.Win). The initial sweepstakes was launched on April 4, 2024 and will be active until December 31, 2024. 

Current
Operations 

Despite
the Operational Cessation, the Company s subsidiaries have continued to operate under the direction of the leadership teams that
were in place prior to the Company s acquisition of such companies. While the operational activities of these subsidiaries vary,
from the Operational Cessation through the date of this Report, each of TinBu, Aganar and JuegaLotto has decreased its expenses and has
had its revenue decrease from pre-Operational Cessation levels. 

Data
Services

2018, we acquired TinBu, LLC TinBu ), a digital publisher and provider of lottery data results, jackpot results, and other
data, as a wholly-owned subsidiary. Through TinBu, our Data Service delivers daily results of over 800 domestic and international lottery
games from more than 40 countries, including the U.S., Canada, and the United Kingdom, to over 400 digital publishers and media organizations.

agreements and in accordance with our Terms of Service in consideration of a fee and in other instances provide the Data Service within
a bundle of provided services.

Aganar
and JuegaLotto

Plans
for Recommencement of Company Operations 

As
noted above, since the Operational Cessation, the Company has had minimal day-to-day operations and has primarily focused on restarting
certain of its core businesses. The Company has developed a three-phase plan to recommence its operations, which plan is outlined below. 

Phase
1 - Relaunch B2B API Platform . During the Operational Cessation, the Company maintained positive relationships with its ticket-printing
and courier partners, as well as several distribution partners that have been found to be in compliance with local, state, and federal
rules related to ticket procurement and distribution. These partners have implemented the Lottery.com API and have advised the Company
that they expect to be ready to offer lottery games to their customers through their sales channels when the Company resumes operations.
As such, the Company believes that it has sufficient demand to resume operation of its B2B API platform operations, assuming it is able
to maintain the core employee team to manage the lottery ticket fulfillment process and access sufficient capital to expand the launch
of Project Nexus, which was designed to, among other things, handle high levels of user traffic and transaction volume, while maintaining
expediency, security, and reliability in the administrative and back-office functionality required by the B2B API. Our B2B API Platform
resumed limited operations in April 2023. 

Phase
2 - Resume B2C Platform Operations. The Company believes that it will be in a position to relaunch its B2C Platform in early 2025.
As of the date of this Report, the Company expects that it will initially relaunch its B2C Platform to customers in Texas for a period
of time before rolling it out to other jurisdictions. The Company may elect to accelerate the relaunch of its Platform to customers in
another state. The Company plans to limit the rollout in order to give it additional time to properly vet and confirm compliance with
local, state and federal rules related to ticket procurement and distribution. For more information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors
- Regulatory and Compliance Risks - A jurisdiction may enact, amend, or reinterpret laws and regulations governing our operations in
ways that impair our revenues, cause us to incur additional legal and compliance costs and other operating expenses, or are otherwise
not favorable to our existing operations or planned growth, all of which may have a material adverse effect on us or our results of operations,
cash flow, or financial condition . , as filed on form 10-K/A for fiscal 2023, on September 24, 2024. The Company has also maintained
various pre-paid media credits that it expects to use to launch and maintain promotional campaigns geared towards encouraging prior customers
to return to the Platform and to acquire new customers. 

Phase
3 - Restore Other Business Lines and Projects. Assuming the success of Phase 1 and Phase 2, the Company expects to restore other
products it previously offered, such as supplying lottery tickets to consumers in approved domestic jurisdictions, partnering with licensed
providers in international jurisdictions to supply legitimate domestic lottery games, and reviving other products and services that were
under development when the Operational Cessation occurred. 

8 

As
of the date of this Report, the current estimated cash balance of the Company and subsidiaries is approximately 16,845. The Company
believes that this cash on hand, along with future borrowings, will be sufficient for the Company to resume its core operations. 

As
of the date of this Report, our common stock and warrants are traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq under the
ticker symbols LTRY and LTRYW, respectively. As of the date of this Report, we are not in compliance
with Nasdaq s continued listing requirements (the Listing Rules ). See, Risk Factors - Risks
Related to Our Common Stock and Warrants We are not currently in full compliance with the continued listing standards
of Nasdaq, we may not be able to regain full compliance with Nasdaq s continued listing standards in the future . 
Additionally, under its new management, the Company continues to work to improve its disclosure and reporting controls. Also, the
Company plans to continue to strengthen and improve its systems of internal control over financial reporting and invest in
additional legal, accounting, and financial resources. 

Even
if the Company s three phase plan to recommence its operations is successful, there can be no assurance that the Company will be
able to regain and maintain compliance with the applicable Listing Rules. If the Company s securities are delisted from Nasdaq, it could be more difficult
to buy or sell the Company s common stock and warrants or to obtain accurate quotations, and the price of the Company s common
stock and warrants could suffer a material decline. Delisting could also impair the Company s ability to raise additional capital
needed to fund its operations and/or trigger defaults and penalties under outstanding agreements or securities of the Company. 

There
can be no assurance that we will have sufficient capital to support our operations and pay expenses, repay our debt, or that additional
funds will be available on favorable terms, if at all. We may not be able to restart our operations or generate sufficient funding to
support such operations in the future. The Company s ability to continue its current operations, prepare and refile required reports,
and restart its prior operations, is dependent upon obtaining new financing. Future financing options available to the Company include
equity financings, debt financings or other capital sources, including collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions.
Equity financings may include sales of common stock. Such financing may not be available on terms favorable to the Company or at all.
The terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or rights of the Company s stockholders and may cause significant
dilution to existing stockholders. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining sufficient funding on terms
acceptable to the Company, if at all, which would have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of
operations, and it could ultimately be forced to discontinue its operations and liquidate. These matters, when considered in the aggregate,
raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time, which is defined
as within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The accompanying financial statements do not contain any
adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Components
of Our Results of Operations (Prior to the Operational Cessation) 

Our
Revenue 

Revenue
from B2C Platform. Our revenue is the retail value of the acquired lottery game and the service fee charged to the user, which we
impose on each lottery game purchased from our B2C Platform. The amount of the service fee is based upon several factors, including the
retail value of the lottery game purchased by a user, the number of lottery games purchased by a user, and whether such user is located
within the U.S. or internationally. Currently, in the U.S, the minimum service fee is 0.50 for the purchase of a 1 lottery game and
 1 for the purchase of a 2 lottery game; the service fee for additional lottery games purchased in the same transaction is 6 of the
face value of all lottery games purchased. For example, the service fee for the purchase of five 2 tickets is 1.60, comprised of the
 1 base service fee, plus 6 of the aggregate value of the face value of all lottery games purchased. The Company did not operate its
B2C platform in 2023. 

Internationally,
B2C sales in jurisdictions where we do not have direct or indirect authority generate an immaterial amount of revenue, and we are assessing
our operations in these jurisdictions. As discussed above, our B2C Platform is not currently operational. We anticipate that our B2C
Platform will become operational in early 2025. 

Revenue
from B2B API. Together with our third-party commercial partner(s), we agree on the amount of the technology usage fee to be imposed
on the sale of each lottery game purchased through the B2B API, if any, together with a service fee to be charged to the user; we receive
up to 50 of the net revenues from such technology usage fee and service fee pursuant to our commercial agreement with each commercial
partner. As discussed above, following the Operational Cessation, our B2B API Platform resumed limited operations in April 2023. 

Data
Services. Commercial acquirers of our Data Service pay a subscription for access to the Data Service and, for acquisition of certain
large data sets, an additional per record fee. The Company additionally enters into multi-year contracts pursuant to which it sells proprietary,
anonymized transaction data pursuant to multi-year agreements and in accordance with our Terms of Service in consideration of a fee.
Our Data Services operations were not impacted by the Operational Cessation. 

Our
Operating Costs and Expenses 

Personnel
Costs. Personnel costs include salaries, payroll taxes, health insurance, worker s compensation and other benefits for management
and office personnel. 

Professional

Key
Trends and Factors Affecting Our Results 

The
following describes the trends associated with our business prior to the Operational Cessation that have impacted, and which we expect
will continue to impact, our business and results of operations in a material way: 

International
operations . We face challenges related to expanding our footprint globally and the related process of obtaining the licenses and
regulatory approvals necessary to provide services and products within new and emerging markets. The international jurisdictions where
we operate and seek to expand have been subject to increasing foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar, inflationary pressures
and political and economic instability. We expect these trends to continue during the remainder of fiscal 2024 and into 2025 and believe
they are likely to affect consumer spending, which could have a material impact on our revenues. As a result, it may take longer to achieve
projected revenue gains or generate cash in any such regions affected or any new foreign jurisdiction into which we expand. 

Introduction
of a new gaming platform . We developed a proprietary, blockchain-enabled gaming platform, which we named Project Nexus. Project Nexus
is designed to handle high levels of user traffic and transaction volume, while maintaining expediency, security, and reliability in
(i) the processing of lottery game sales, (ii) fulfillment of retail requirements of the B2C Platform, (iii) the administrative and back-office
functionality required by our B2B API, and (iv) the requirements of our claims and redemption process. We expect to utilize this platform
to launch new products, including any proprietary products we may introduce. The introduction of new technology like Project Nexus is
subject to risks including, among other things, implementation delays, issues successfully integrating the technology into our solutions,
or the possibility that the technology does not produce the expected benefits. 

Our
growth plans and the competitive landscape. Our direct competitors operate in the global entertainment and gaming industries and,
like us, seek to expand their product and service offerings with integrated products and solutions. Our short-to-medium term focus is
on increasing our penetration in our existing U.S. jurisdictions by increasing direct to consumer marketing campaigns, introducing our
B2C Platform into new U.S. and select foreign jurisdictions and acquiring synergistic regulated and sports betting enterprises domestically
and abroad. 

Competition
in the sale of online lottery games has significantly increased in recent years, is currently characterized by intense price-based competition,
and is subject to changing technology, shifting needs and frequent introductions of new games, development platforms and services. To
maintain our competitive edge alongside other established industry players (many of which have more resources, or capital), we expect
to incur greater operating expenses, such as increased marketing expenses, increased compliance expenses, increased personnel and advisory
expenses associated with being a public company, additional operational expenses and salaries for personnel to support expected growth,
additional expenses associated with our ability to execute on our strategic initiatives including our aim to undertake merger and acquisition
activities, as well as additional capital expenditures associated with the ongoing development and further implementation of Project
Nexus. 

Current
Plan of Operations 

As
of the date of this Report, the Company s primary revenue drivers are the resumption of its B2B API platform and the launch of
Sports.com. It is anticipated that operational costs for the next 12 months through October 31, 2025 will be greater than revenues. It
is anticipated that the liquidity gap will be satisfied by equity investment or debt incurred, of which there is no assurance. We anticipate
that our B2C Platform will become operational by in early 2025. 

Beyond
the next 12 months, the Company plans to continue to expand domestic and international operations. Moreover, the Company plans to enhance
its mobile application to include pool plays, ticket subscriptions, loyalty programs and various gamification modules. 

11 

Results
of Operations 

Our
consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include
adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should
we be unable to continue in operation. We will require additional capital to meet our long-term operating requirements. We expect to
raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.

the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 117 thousand compared to 213 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a

Operating expenses for the three
months ended September 30, 2024 were 3.7 million, an increase of 379 thousand, or 11 , compared to 3.4 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. The increase was driven by an increase of 1.05 million in professional fees accompanied an increase in general
and administrative costs of 156 thousand, offset by decreases in personnel costs by 611 thousand and depreciation and amortization by
 213 thousand. Reasons for these decreases are described below. 

Personnel Costs . Personnel
costs were 679 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 611 thousand from 1.3 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily related to the absence of stock based compensation expense for the three months ended
September 30, 2024. Stock based compensation expense of 358 thousand which was recognized in the three months ended September 30, 2023,
did not reoccur in the third quarter of 2024. 

Professional Fees . Professional
fees increased by 1.05 Million or 261 , from 401 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 1.4 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was due to expenses incurred for outside attorneys and other consultants in the three months
ended September 30, 2024. Activity levels for the business, and these types of expense were lower for the same period in 2023. 

13 

General and
Administrative . General and administrative expenses were 412 thousand, for the three months
ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 156 thousand from 255 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is related to use of a new public relations firm and rent for the Boca Raton campus for
Sports.com. 

Depreciation and Amortization.
 Depreciation and amortization decreased 213 thousand, or 15 , from 1.42 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to
 1.20 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily driven by write-offs to intangible assets related
to Global Gaming at the end of 2023 as well as another intangible asset becoming fully amortized at the end of 2023 - both of which
resulted in lower amortization expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 127 thousand vs interest expense of 243 thousand for the three months ended
September 30, 2023, a decrease of 117 thousand or 48 . Interest expense relates to notes payable from the time of the business combination
plus interest on more recent convertible notes from Woodford, UCIL, and Univest. An adjustment was made in the three months ended September
30, 2023 to interest expense on notes payable from the time of the business combination which resulted in higher interest expense for
that period resulting in a decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Other (Income) Expense .
Global Gaming had approximately 21thousand of other income for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Loss on impairment of goodwill
 intangibles. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we determained that certain components of goodwill intangible
assets were impaired. The loss on impairment of goodwill intangibles for the three months ended September 30, 2024 includes write-offs
to goodwill of 1.58 million related to the TinBu subsidiary and 1.91M related to the Global Gaming subsidiary as well as write offs

Operating expenses for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 15.6 million, an increase of 3.7 million, or 31 , compared to 11.9 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by an increase of 4.5 million in professional fees offset by decreases in: personnel costs by 153 thousand, general and administrative by 174 thousand, and depreciation and amortization by 395 thousand. Reasons for these decreases
are described below. 

Personnel Costs . Personnel
costs decreased by 153 thousand from 3.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 3.5 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024. The composition of the team is different for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 than it was for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. Some of the legacy employees who were working to regain compliance with Nasdaq and SEC reporting requirements
during the spring of 2023 departed so there is no corresponding expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Professional Fees . Professional
fees increased by 4.5 million, or 178 , from 2.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 6.9 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024. The increase was due to expenses incurred for outside attorneys, other consultants, and directors in the nine
months ended September 30, 2024. 

15 

General and Administrative.
General and administrative expenses decreased 174 thousand, or 11 , from 1.56 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023
to 1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease is because
expenses incurred during the first half of 2023 in connection with the Company s efforts to regain compliance with Nasdaq and
SEC reporting requirements did not re-occur in 2024. 

Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization decreased
 395 thousand, or 9 , from 4.22 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.82 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2024. The decrease was primarily driven by write-offs to intangible assets related to Global Gaming at the end of 2023 as well as
another intangible asset becoming fully amortized at the end of 2023 - - both of which resulted in lower amortization expense for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024.

expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 351 thousand vs interest expense of 285 thousand for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, an increase of 66 thousand or 23 . Interest expense relates to notes payable from the time of the business combination
plus interest on more recent convertible notes from Woodford, UCIL, and Univest. The convertible debt increased in the third and fourth
quarters of 2023 and first and second quarters of 2024. Higher amounts of convertible debt in the nine months ended September 30, 2024
as compared with the nine months ended September 30,2023 resulted in the increase in interest expense. 

Other Expense . Other expense decreased by 73 thousand, or 119 from
 62 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to (12) thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Expenses incurred
in the first half of 2023 in connection with the Company s efforts to regain compliance with Nasdaq and SEC reporting requirements
were non-recurring, resulting in lower expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Loss on impairment of goodwill
 intangibles . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we determined that certain components of goodwill intangible
assets were impaired. The loss on impairment of goodwill intangibles for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes write-offs
to goodwill of 1.58 million related to the TinBu subsidiary and 1.91M related to the Global Gaming subsidiary as well as write offs
of 817 thousand related to intangible assets of Global Gaming for a total of 4.3 million. There were no impairments to goodwill and
intangibles for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Prior
to the Operational Cessation, our primary need for liquidity was to fund working capital requirements of our business, growth, capital
expenditures and for general corporate purposes. Our primary source of liquidity had historically been funds generated by financing activities.
Upon the Closing of the business combination on October 29, 2021, we received net proceeds of approximately 42.8 million in cash. 

Following
the Operational Cessation, our primary need for liquidity has been to fund the restart of our business operations, re-hire employees
and pay our expenses. The most likely source of such future funding presently available to us is through additional borrowings under
loan agreements or through the issuance of equity or debt securities. If lenders do not advance us amounts as agreed under loan agreements
or we are otherwise not able to secure the necessary capital to restart our operations, hire new employees, and obtain funding sufficient
to support and restart our operations, we may be forced to permanently cease our operations, sell off our assets and operations, and/or
seek bankruptcy protection, which could cause the value of our securities to become worthless. 

These
conditions, along with our current lack of material revenue producing activities, and significant debt, raise substantial doubt about
our ability to continue as a going concern for the next 12 months. For more information, see Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies,
Going Concern to the consolidated financial statements included herein, as well as the risk factors included in Item 1A of this Report
entitled In July 2022, we furloughed the majority of our employees and suspended our lottery game sales operations after determining
that we did not have sufficient financial sources to fund our operations or pay certain existing obligations, including our payroll and
related obligations. As a result, we may not be able to continue as a going concern and We need additional capital
to, among other things, support and restart our operations, re-hire employees and pay our expenses. Such capital may not be available
on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. If we do not receive the additional capital, we may be forced to curtail or abandon our
plans to recommence our operations and we may need to permanently cease our operations. , as filed on form 10-K/A for fiscal
2023, on September 24, 2024. 

Prior
Convertible Debt Obligations 

Prior
to the Closing, we funded our operations through the issuance of convertible promissory notes. 

From
August to October 2017, the Company entered into seven Convertible Promissory Note Agreements with unaffiliated investors for an aggregate
amount of 821,500. The notes bore interest at 10 per year, were unsecured, and were due and payable on June 30, 2019. The Company and
the noteholders executed amendments in February 2021 to extend the maturity date to December 21, 2021. 

16 

From
November 2019 through October 28, 2021, we issued approximately 48.2 million in aggregate principal amount of Series B convertible promissory
notes. The notes bore interest at 8 per year, were unsecured, and were due and payable on dates ranging from December 2020 to December
2022. For those promissory notes that would have matured on or before December 31, 2020, the parties extended the maturity date to December
21, 2021 through amendments executed in February 2021. The amendments also allowed for automatic conversion to equity as a result of
the Business Combination. Nearly all of the aforementioned promissory notes automatically converted into shares of Common Stock or were
terminated pursuant to their terms, as applicable, in connection with the Closing. Those that remain outstanding do not have conversion
terms that were triggered by the Closing. 

Immediately
prior to the Closing, approximately 60.0 million of convertible debt was converted into equity of AutoLotto. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had 2,183,089 of convertible debt outstanding. A portion of this debt has matured and is theoretically in
default.

Emerging
Growth Company Accounting Election 

Section
102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards
until private companies are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company
can choose not to take advantage of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth
companies, and any such election to not take advantage of the extended transition period is irrevocable. We are an emerging growth
company as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and have elected to take advantage of the benefits
of this extended transition period. We expect to remain an emerging growth company through the end of the 2026 fiscal year and we expect
to continue to take advantage of the benefits of the extended transition period. This may make it difficult or impossible to compare
the financial results with the financial results of another public company that is either not an emerging growth company or is an emerging
growth company that has chosen not to take advantage of the extended transition period exemptions for emerging growth companies because
of the potential differences in accounting standards used. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Report are prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reporting values of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The more significant estimates and assumptions are those
used in determining the recoverability of long-lived assets. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. To the extent
that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition,
results of operations and cash flow will be affected. 

Our
critical accounting policies are described under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in the Annual Report and the notes to the audited financial
statements appearing elsewhere in the Annual Report. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes
to our critical accounting policies from those discussed in our Amended 2023 Annual Report. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,
 Leases (Topic 842). This guidance requires recognition of most lease liabilities on the balance sheet to give investors,
lenders, and other financial statement users a more comprehensive view of a company s long-term financial obligations, as well
as the assets it owns versus leases. ASU 2016-02 became effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and for interim
periods within annual periods after December 15, 2022. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11 making transition requirements less
burdensome. The standard provides an option to apply the transition provisions of the new standard at its adoption date instead of at
the earliest comparative period presented in the Company s financial statements. We are currently evaluating the impact that this
guidance will have on our financial statements as well as the expected adoption method. The adoption of this standard will not
have a material impact on our financial statements. 

In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial
Instruments , as additional guidance on the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments. The new guidance requires the
measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions
and reasonable supportable forecasts. In addition, the guidance amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities
and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. The new guidance became effective for all public companies for interim and
annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for interim and annual periods beginning after December
15, 2018. In October 2019, the FASB approved a proposal which grants smaller reporting companies additional time to implement FASB standards
on current expected credit losses (CECL) to January 2023. As a smaller reporting company, we deferred adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 until
January 2023. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements.

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As
previously disclosed, in connection with the filing of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2021 (the Original 2021 Annual Report on April 1, 2022, our management, with the participation of our then Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2021. Based on their evaluation, our then Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2021, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to
material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting with respect to our financial statement close and reporting process. 

In
connection with the filing of Amendment No. 1 to the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2021
(the Amended 2021 Annual Report ), our new management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, reevaluated
the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act) as of December 31, 2021 and determined they were not effective due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial
reporting with respect to our financial statement close and reporting process. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

Material
Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

In
connection with the audit of our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Report, our management identified material
weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 relating to deficiencies in the design and
operation of the procedures relating to the closing of our financial statements. These include: (i) our lack of a sufficient number of
personnel with an appropriate level of knowledge and experience in accounting for complex or non-routine transactions, (ii) the fact
that our policies and procedures with respect to the review, supervision and monitoring of our accounting and reporting functions were
either not designed and in place or not operating effectively; (iii) our inability to complete the timely closing of financial books
at the quarter and fiscal year end, and (iv) incomplete segregation of duties in certain types of transactions and processes. 

Specifically,
management did not design and maintain sufficient procedures and controls related to revenue recognition including those related to ensuring
accuracy of revenue recognized from non-routine transactions such as the sales of LotteryLink Credits. As a result, we determined that
there was an overstatement of revenue in the consolidated statement of operations of approximately 52.1 million during the year ended
December 31, 2021, which required a restatement of the previously issued financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021 contained
in the Amended 2021 Annual Report. 

18 

We
have begun implementing remediation steps to improve our internal control over financial reporting and to remediate the identified material
weaknesses, including (i) adding personnel with sufficient accounting knowledge; (ii) adopting a more rigorous period-end review process
for financial reporting; (iii) adopting improved period close processes and accounting processes, and (iv) clearly defining and documenting
the segregation of duties for certain transactions and processes. Management has expanded and will continue to enhance our system of
identifying transactions and evaluating and implementing the accounting standards that apply to our financial statements, including through
enhanced analyses by our personnel and third-party professionals with whom we consult regarding complex accounting applications. We intend
to continue to take steps to remediate the material weaknesses described above and further continue re-assessing the design of controls,
the testing of controls and modifying processes designed to improve our internal control over financial reporting. The Company plans
to continue to assess its internal controls and procedures and intends to take further action as necessary or appropriate to address
any other matters it identifies or are brought to its attention. We will not be able to fully remediate these material weaknesses until
these steps have been completed and have been operating effectively for a sufficient period of time. The implementation of our remediation
will be ongoing and will require validation and testing of the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over a sustained
period of financial reporting cycles. We may also conclude that additional measures may be required to remediate the material weaknesses
in our internal control over financial reporting. 

We
cannot assure you that the measures we take will be sufficient to remediate the material weaknesses we identified or avoid the identification
of additional material weaknesses in the future. If the steps we take do not remediate the material weaknesses in a timely manner, there
could continue to be a reasonable possibility that this control deficiency or others could result in another material misstatement of
our annual or interim financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

For
more information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - Public Company Operating Risks - If we fail to implement and maintain an effective
system of internal controls, we may be unable to accurately report our results of operations, meet our reporting obligations or prevent
fraud, and investor confidence and the trading price of our common stock and warrants may be materially and adversely affected . ,
as filed on form 10-K/A for fiscal 2023, on September 24, 2024. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Except
as otherwise described herein, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the
evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that
has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

deny Skadden s Motion for a Charging Lien as a matter of law or, in the alternative, limit the charging lien to the amount
of the attorneys fees awarded by the Fee Order. As of the date of this Report, the Chancery Court has not set Skadden s
Motion for an oral hearing, nor has it entered an order on the motion. On January 20, 2023, faced with post-judgment discovery and depositions,

Item
1A. Risk Factors. 

As
of the date of this Report, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in the Company s Annual Report, other
than as set forth below. In addition, we may disclose additional changes to such factors or disclose additional factors from time to
time in our future filings with the SEC. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results
of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also
impair our business or results of operations. 

We
are currently not in full compliance with the continued listing standards of Nasdaq, we may not be able to regain full compliance with
Nasdaq s continued listing standards in the future. 

Our
common stock and warrants trade on The Nasdaq Global Market under the symbols LTRY and LTRYW, respectively.
Our failure to regain full compliance with all these requirements may result in our securities being delisted from Nasdaq. 

As
of the date of this Report, our common stock is trading below Nasdaq s 1.00 (U.S.) minimum trading price requirement (the Minimum
Trading Price ), an minimum trading price that was breached on July 30, 2024. Should the Minimum Trading Price not be restored,
the Company risks having its securities delisted by Nasdaq. 

If
the Company s securities are delisted from Nasdaq, it could be more difficult to buy and sell the Company s common stock
and warrants or to obtain accurate quotations, and the price of the Company s common stock and warrants could suffer a material
decline. Delisting could also impair the Company s ability to raise capital and/or trigger defaults and penalties under its outstanding
agreements or securities. Further, even if we regain compliance with Nasdaq listing requirements, there is no guarantee that we will
be able to maintain our listing for any period of time. 

Delisting
from Nasdaq could also result in negative publicity. Further, if we are delisted, we would also incur additional costs under state blue
sky laws in connection with any sales of our securities. These requirements could severely limit the market liquidity of our common stock
and/or warrants and the ability of our stockholders to sell our common stock and/or warrants in the secondary market. If our common stock
and/or warrants are delisted by Nasdaq, our common stock and/or warrants may be eligible to trade on an over-the-counter quotation system,
such as the OTCQB Market, where an investor may find it more difficult to sell our stock or obtain accurate quotations as to the market
value of our common stock and/or warrants. In the event our common stock and/or warrants are delisted from The Nasdaq Global Market,
we may not be able to list our common stock and/or warrants on another national securities exchange or obtain quotation on an over-the
counter quotation system. 

Competition
in the sports media market could impair our ability to generate revenue from Sports.com 

The
landscape of the sports content industry is changing as traditional media companies are putting a focus on developing original sports
content. In recent years, Apple, Netflix, Warner Brothers Discovery, and Amazon have produced original sports content and entered into
agreements to broadcast live sporting events. Their entry into the market could limit our ability to acquire streaming rights for live
sports events. Costs to produce original content may increase to the point where we cannot compete in the sector. 

Federal
and State Tax Filings 

The
Company files U.S. federal and state income and franchise tax returns. The Company has not filed its 2021, 2022 and 2023 U.S.
federal and state income and franchise tax returns. The Company expects to file these as soon as possible. The
Company is in a net loss position and expects no tax amounts to be due to the federal government. The company has accrued for estimated
state and local income and franchise taxes. but is at risk of penalties and interest for failure to timely file. 

Consumer
trends in paying for streaming content may have an adverse impact on the Sports.com subscription service. 

The
global video streaming market is expected to experience a compound annual growth rate of 17.8 over the next eight years, reaching a
value of 2.4 trillion by 2032. With more than 200 global streaming services, consumers are presented with a wide array of choices where
to spend their discretionary entertainment dollars. Since 2022, 25 of streaming subscribers have cancelled three or more services. Additionally,
21 of subscribers intend to cancel at least one additional in 2024. This trend may negatively impact our ability to attract new customers
or may increase the costs of both customer acquisition and retention.

5. Eligibility 

(a) General
Rule. All Employees, Directors and Consultants defined in Section 2(e) and 2(g) shall be eligible. 

(b)
Ten Percent Stockholders. An Employee, Director or Consultant who owns more than ten percent (10 of the total combined voting

(f) Incentive
Option Limitation. The aggregate Fair Market Value of the stock for which Incentive Options granted to any one eligible Employee, Director
or Consultant under this Plan and under all incentive stock option plans of the Company, its parent(s) and subsidiaries, may by their

to any Option as of the time that Option is granted. If the date on which one or more Incentive Options could be first exercised would
be accelerated pursuant to any other provision of the Plan or any Stock Option Agreement referred to in Section 6(a), or an amendment
thereto, and the acceleration of such exercise date would result in a violation of the restriction set forth in the preceding sentence,
then notwithstanding any such other provision the exercise date of such Incentive Options shall be accelerated only to the extent, if
any, that is permitted under Section 422 of the Code and the exercise date of the Incentive Options with the lowest option prices shall
be accelerated first. Any exercise date which cannot be accelerated without violating the 100,000 restriction of this section shall
nevertheless be accelerated, and the portion of the Option becoming exercisable thereby shall be treated as a Nonstatutory Option. 

6. 
 Terms
 and Conditions of All Options Under the Plan. 

(a) Option
Agreement. All Options granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by a written Option Agreement and shall be subject to all applicable
terms and conditions of the Plan and may be subject to any other terms and conditions which are not inconsistent with the Plan and which
the Committee deems appropriate for inclusion in an Option Agreement. 

(b) Number
of Shares. Each Option Agreement shall specify the number of shares of the Stock each such Employee, Director or Consultant will be entitled
to purchase pursuant to the Option and shall provide for the adjustment of such number in accordance with Section 9. Each Option Agreement
shall state the minimum number of shares which must be exercised at any time, if any. 

(c) Nature
of Option. Each Option Agreement shall specify the intended nature of the Option as an Incentive Option, a Nonstatutory Option or partly
of each type.

(e) Term
of Option. The Option Agreement shall specify the term of the Option. The term of any Option granted under this Plan is subject to expiration,
termination, and cancellation as set forth within this Plan. 

(f) Exercisability;

years from the date such Option is granted. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee may grant Options which are vested,
or which become vested upon the happening of an event or events as specified by the Committee. 

(g) Withholding
Taxes. Upon exercise of any Nonstatutory Option (or any Incentive Option which is treated as a Nonstatutory Option because it fails to
meet the requirements set forth in the Code for Incentive Options), the Optionee must tender full payment to the Company for any federal
income tax withholding required under the Code in connection with such exercise Withholding Tax ). If the Optionee fails
to tender to the Company the Withholding Tax, the Committee, at its discretion, shall withhold from the Optionee any and all shares subject

2023 Employees Directors and Consultants Stock Issuance and Option Plan Page 4 of 8 

(h) Termination and Acceleration of Option. 

For
Incentive Options: 

(i) If
the employment of a Grantee who is not a Disabled Grantee is terminated without cause, or such Grantee voluntarily quits or retires under
any retirement plan of the Company, any then outstanding and exercisable stock option held by such a Grantee shall be exercisable, in
accordance with the provisions of the Option Agreement, by such Grantee at any time prior to the expiration date of such Option or within
three months after the date of termination of employment or service, whichever is the shorter period. 

(ii)
If the employment of a Grantee who is a Disabled Grantee is terminated without cause, any then outstanding and exercisable Option held
by such a Grantee shall be exercisable, in accordance with the provisions of the Option Agreement, by such a Grantee at any time prior
to the expiration date of such Option or within one year after the date of such termination of employment or service, whichever is the
shorter period. 

For
all Options issued hereunder: 

(i) If
the Company terminates the employment of a Grantee for cause, all outstanding stock options held by the Grantee at the time of such termination
shall automatically terminate unless the Committee notifies the Grantee that his or her options will not terminate. A termination for
cause shall be defined under each written Option Agreement. The Company assumes no responsibility and is under no obligation to
notify a Permitted Transferee (as hereafter defined in section 13) of early termination of an Option on account of a Grantee s
termination of employment. 

(ii) Whether
termination of employment or other service is a termination for cause or whether a Grantee is a Disabled Grantee shall
be determined in each case, in its discretion, by the Committee and any such determination by the Committee shall be final and binding. 

(iii) Following
the death of a Grantee during employment, any outstanding and exercisable Options held by such Grantee at the time of death shall be
exercisable, in accordance with the provisions of the Option Agreement, by the person or persons entitled to do so under the Will of
the Grantee, or, if the Grantee shall fail to make testamentary disposition of the stock option or shall die intestate, by the legal
representative of the Grantee at any time prior to the expiration date of such Option or within one year after the date of death, whichever
is the shorter period. 

(iv) The
Committee may grant Options, or amend Options previously granted, to provide that such Options continue to be exercisable up to ten years
after the date of grant irrespective of the termination of the Grantee s employment with the Company, and which vest upon grant
or become vested upon the happening of an event or events specified by the Committee, although the exercise of such vested Options in
the case of Incentive Options more than three months after termination of employment may convert such Options to Nonstatutory Options
with respect to the income tax consequences of such exercise. 

7. Payment
 for Shares 

(a) Cash.
Payment in full for shares purchased under an Option shall be made in cash (including check, bank draft or money order) or pursuant to
a cashless exercise provision, if any is available under the Option Agreement, at the time that the Option is exercised. 

(b) Stock.
In lieu of cash an Optionee may, with the consent of the Committee, make payment for Stock purchased under an Option, in whole or in
part, by tendering to the Company in good form for transfer, shares of Stock valued at Fair Market Value on the date the Option is exercised.
Such shares will have been owned by the Optionee or the Optionee s representative for the time specified by the Committee but in
no case shall the Optionee or his representative have held a beneficial interest in such tendered shares for a period less than six months
prior to the exercise of the Option. 

2023 Employees Directors and Consultants Stock Issuance and Option Plan Page 5 of 8 

8. Use
 of Proceeds from Stock. 

Cash
proceeds from the sale of Stock pursuant to Options granted under the Plan shall constitute general funds of the Company. 

9. Adjustments. 

Changes
or adjustments in the Option price, number of shares subject to an Option or other specifics as the Committee should decide will be considered
or made pursuant to the following rules: 

(a) Upon
Changes in Stock. If the outstanding Stock is increased or decreased, or is changed into or exchanged for a different number or kinds
of shares or securities, as a result of one or more reorganizations, recapitalization, stock splits, reverse stock splits, split-up,
combination of shares, exchange of shares, change in corporate structure, or otherwise, appropriate adjustments will be made in the exercise
price and/ or the number and/or kind of shares or securities for which Options may thereafter be granted under this Plan and for which
Options then outstanding under this Plan may thereafter be exercised. The Committee will make such adjustments as it may deem fair, just
and equitable to prevent substantial dilution or enlargement of the rights granted to or available for Optionees. No adjustment provided
for in this Section 9 will require the Company to issue or sell a fraction of a share or other security. Nothing in this Section will
be construed to require the Company to make any specific or formula adjustment. 

(b) Prohibited
Adjustment. If any such adjustment provided for in this Section 9 requires the approval of stockholders in order to enable the Company
to grant or amend Options, then no such adjustment will be made without the required stockholder approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if the effect of any such adjustment would be to cause an Incentive Option to fail to continue to qualify under Section 422 of the Code
or to cause a modification, extension or renewal of such stock option within the meaning described in Section 424 of the Code, the Committee
may elect that such adjustment not be made but rather shall use reasonable efforts to effect such other adjustment of each then outstanding
Option as the Committee, in its sole discretion, shall deem equitable and which will not result in any disqualification, modification,
extension or renewal (within the meaning of Section 424 of the Code) of such Incentive Option. 

(c) Further
Limitations. Nothing in this Section will entitle the Optionee to adjustment of his Option in the following circumstances: 

(i)
The issuance or sale of additional shares of the Stock, through public offering or otherwise; 

(ii) The issuance or authorization of an additional class of capital stock of the Company; 

(iii) The conversion of convertible preferred stock or debt of the Company into Stock; 

(iv) The payment of dividends except as provided in Section 9 (a). 

The
grant of an Option shall not affect in any way the right or power of the Company to make adjustments, reclassifications, reorganizations
or changes of its capital or business structure, to merge or consolidate or to dissolve, liquidate, sell or transfer all or any part
of its business or assets. 

2023 Employees Directors and Consultants Stock Issuance and Option Plan Page 6 of 8 

10. Legal
 Requirements: 

(a) Compliance
with All Laws. The Company will not be required to issue or deliver any certificates for shares of Stock prior to (a) the listing of
any such Stock to be acquired pursuant to the exercise of any Option on any stock exchange on which the Stock may then be listed, and
(b) the compliance with any registration requirements or qualification of such shares under any federal securities laws, including without
limitation the Securities Act of 1933, as amended 1933 Act ), the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or state
securities laws and regulations, the regulations of any stock exchange or interdealer quotation system on which the Company s securities
may then be listed, or obtaining any ruling or waiver from any government body which the Company may, in its sole discretion, determine
to be necessary or advisable, or which, in the opinion of counsel to the Company, is otherwise required. 

(b) Compliance
with Specific Code Provisions. It is the intent of the Company that the Plan and its administration conform strictly to the requirements
of Section 422 of the Code with respect to Incentive Options. Therefore, notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, nothing herein
will contravene any requirement set forth in Section 422 of the Code with respect to Incentive Options and if inconsistent provisions
are otherwise found herein, they will be deemed void and unenforceable or automatically amended to conform, as the case may be. 

(c) Plan
Subject to Delaware Law. All questions arising with respect to the provisions of the Plan will be determined by application of the Code
and the laws of the state of Delaware except to the extent that Nevada laws are preempted by any federal law. 

11. Rights
 as a Stockholder. 

An
Optionee shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to any Stock covered by his or her Option until the date of issuance of the
stock certificate to him or her after receipt of the consideration in full set forth in the Option Agreement. Except as provided in Section
9 hereof, no adjustments will be made for dividends, whether ordinary or extraordinary, whether in cash, securities, or other property,
or for distributions for which the record date is prior to the date on which the Option is exercised. 

12. Restrictions
 on Shares. 

Prior
to the issuance or delivery of any shares of the Stock under the Plan, the person exercising the Option may be required to: 

(a) represent
and warrant that the shares of the Stock to be acquired upon exercise of the Option are being acquired for investment for the account
of such person and not with a view to resale or other distribution thereof; 

(b) represent
and warrant that such person will not, directly or indirectly, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of any
such shares unless the sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, hypothecation or other disposition of the shares is pursuant to the provisions
of this Plan and effective registrations under the 1933 Act and any applicable state or foreign securities laws or pursuant to appropriate
exemptions from any such registrations; and 

(c) execute
such further documents as may reasonably be required by the Committee upon exercise of the Option or any part thereof, including but
not limited to any stock restriction agreement that the Committee may choose to require. 

2023 Employees Directors and Consultants Stock Issuance and Option Plan Page 7 of 8 

Nothing
in this Plan shall assure any Optionee that shares issuable under this Option are registered on a Form S-8 under the 1933 Act or on any
other Form. The certificate or certificates representing the shares of the Stock to be issued or delivered upon exercise of an Option
may bear a legend evidencing the foregoing and other legends required by any applicable securities laws. Furthermore, nothing herein
or any Option granted hereunder will require the Company to issue any Stock upon exercise of any Option if the issuance would, in the
opinion of counsel for the Company, constitute a violation of the 1933 Act, applicable state securities laws, or any other applicable
rule or regulation then in effect. The Company shall have no liability for failure to issue shares upon any exercise of Options because
of a delay pending the meeting of any such requirements. 

13. Transferability. 

The
Committee shall retain the authority and discretion to permit a Nonstatutory Option, but in no case an Incentive Option, to be transferable
as long as such transfers are made only to one or more of the following: family members, limited to children of Grantee, spouse of Grantee,
or grandchildren of Grantee, or trusts for the benefit of Grantee and/or such family members Permitted Transferee ), provided
that such transfer is a bona fide gift and accordingly, the Grantee receives no consideration for the transfer, and that the Options
transferred continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions that were applicable to the Options immediately prior to the transfer.
Options are also subject to transfer by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Options granted pursuant to this Plan shall not
be otherwise transferred, assigned, pledged, hypothecated or disposed of in any way, whether by operation of law or otherwise. A Permitted
Transferee may not subsequently transfer an Option. The designation of a beneficiary shall not constitute a transfer. 

14. No
 Right to Continued Employment. 

This
Plan and any Option granted under this Plan will not confer upon any Optionee any right with respect to continued employment or engagement
by the Company nor shall they alter, modify, limit or interfere with any right or privilege of the Company under any employment agreement
heretofore or hereafter executed with any Optionee, including the right to terminate any Optionee s employment or engagement at
any time for or without cause, to change his or her level of compensation or to change his or her responsibilities or position. 

15. 
 Corporate
 Reorganizations. 

Upon
the dissolution or liquidation of the Company, or upon a reorganization, merger or consolidation of the Company as a result of which
the outstanding securities of the class then subject to Options hereunder are changed into or exchanged for cash or property or securities
not of the Company s issue, or upon a sale of substantially all the property of the Company to, or the acquisition of stock representing
more than eighty percent (80 of the voting power of the stock of the Company then outstanding by another corporation or person, the
Plan will terminate and all Options will lapse. The result described above will not occur if provision is made in writing in connection
with such transaction for the continuance of the Plan and/or for the assumption of Options earlier granted, or the substitution for such
Options of options covering the stock of a successor employer corporation, or a parent or a subsidiary thereof, with appropriate adjustments
as to the number and kind of shares and prices, in which event the Plan and Options theretofore granted will continue in the manner and
under the terms so provided. If the Plan and unexercised Options shall terminate pursuant to the foregoing, all persons holding any unexercised
portions of Options then outstanding shall have the right, at such time prior to the consummation of the transaction causing the termination
as the Company shall designate, to exercise the unexercised portions of their options, including the portions thereof which would but
for this Section 15 not yet be exercisable. 

16. Modification,
 Extension and Renewal. 

(a) Options.
Subject to the conditions of and within the limitations prescribed in the Plan herein, the Committee may modify, extend, cancel or renew
outstanding Options. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no modification will, without the prior written consent of the Optionee, alter, impair
or waive any rights or obligations associated with any Option earlier granted under the Plan. 

(b)
Plan. The Board may at any time and from time to time interpret, amend or discontinue the Plan. 

17. Plan
 Date and Duration. 

The
Plan shall take effect on the date it is adopted by the Board. Options may not be granted under this Plan after December 31, 2026.
