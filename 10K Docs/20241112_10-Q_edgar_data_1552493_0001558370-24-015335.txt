SPEs utilized in the securitization programs differ from other entities included in the Company s consolidated financial statements because the assets they hold are legally isolated from the Company s assets. For bankruptcy analysis purposes, the Company has sold the receivables to the SPEs in a true sale and the SPEs are separate legal entities. Upon transfer of the receivables to the SPEs, the receivables and certain cash flows derived from them become restricted for use in meeting obligations to the SPEs creditors. The SPEs have ownership of cash balances that also have restrictions for the benefit of the SPEs investors. The Company s interests in the SPEs receivables are subordinate to the interests of third-party investors. of the receivables that are directly or indirectly sold or transferred in any of these transactions are available to pay the Company s creditors until all obligations of the SPE have been fulfilled or the receivables are removed from the SPE. The secured borrowings related to the restricted receivables are obligations that are payable as the receivables are collected. The following table summarizes the restricted receivables as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: Wholesale Total restricted receivables

As such, for retail receivables, concessions are typically provided based on bankruptcy court proceedings.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Organization CNH Industrial Capital LLC and its primary operating subsidiaries, including New Holland Credit Company, LLC New Holland Credit ), CNH Industrial Capital America LLC CNH Capital America and CNH Industrial Capital Canada Ltd. CNH Capital Canada (collectively, CNH Capital , the Company or we are each an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CNH Industrial N.V. CNH N.V. and, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, CNH and is headquartered in Racine, Wisconsin. As a captive finance company, our primary business is to underwrite and manage financing products for end-use customers and dealers of CNH Industrial America LLC CNH America and CNH Industrial Canada Ltd. CNH Canada and, together with CNH America, CNH North America and provide other related financial products and services to support the sale of agricultural and construction equipment sold by CNH North America. We offer a range of financial products and services to the customers and dealers of CNH North America. Retail financing products primarily include retail notes, finance leases, operating leases and revolving charge account financing to end-use customers. Wholesale financing consists primarily of dealer floorplan financing as well as financing to dealers for used equipment taken in trade, equipment utilized in dealer-owned rental yards, parts inventory, working capital and other financing needs. Trends and Economic Conditions In combination with the downturn in CNH North America s industry cycle, lower commodity prices, changes in government policies, higher interest rates and repercussions from geopolitical events, the global economy continues to experience events affecting CNH North America s suppliers, customers and business operations. As a consequence of the industry downturn and the resulting increase in dealer inventories of CNH North America s products, CNH North America expects production volumes to decline for the rest of 2024 due to lower demand. Given these conditions, CNH North America expects manufacturing inefficiencies and lower fixed cost absorption. These disruptions have contributed to an inflationary environment which has affected, and may continue to affect, the price and availability of certain products and services necessary for CNH North America s operations, how CNH North America plans production for the end-customer demand, and how CNH North America invests in future innovations. Our business is closely tied to the agricultural and construction equipment industries because we offer financing products for such equipment. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, CNH s net sales of agricultural equipment and net sales of construction equipment generated in North America were 1,402.0 million and 357.7 million, respectively, representing decreases of 22.4 and 34.2 from the same period in 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, CNH s net sales of agricultural equipment and net sales of construction equipment generated in North America were 4,583.2 million and 1,300.1 million, respectively, representing decreases of 11.3 and 18.4 from the same period in 2023, respectively. In general, our receivable mix between agricultural and construction equipment financing directionally reflects the mix of equipment sales by CNH North America. As such, changes in the agricultural industry or with respect to our agricultural equipment customers may affect the majority of our portfolio. As a finance company, we are subject to interest rate risks. Changing interest rates can reduce demand for CNH North America equipment, adversely affect our interest margins and increase our borrowing costs. Most of our retail customer receivables are fixed rate, while our revolving charge accounts and wholesale receivables are a combination of fixed and floating rate. We manage interest rate risks via a match funding program and the selective use of derivatives.

 Net income was 63.2 million and 176.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 50.7 million and 144.7 million for the same periods in 2023, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases were primarily driven by a higher average portfolio coupled with a higher average yield for the total portfolio, partially offset by increased borrowing costs, higher provisions for credit losses, and lower gains on used equipment sales due to decreased operating lease maturities and recovery rates. The receivables balance greater than 30 days past due as a percentage of receivables was 1.0 at September 30, 2024 and 0.8 at December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023. Macroeconomic issues for us include the uncertainty of governmental actions with respect to monetary, fiscal and legislative policies, global economic volatility, changes in demand and pricing for used equipment, capital market disruptions, trade agreements, and financial regulatory reform. Significant volatility in the price of certain commodities could also impact CNH North America s and our results.

The allowance is subject to a quarterly evaluation based on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including historical loss experience by product category, portfolio duration, delinquency trends, forward-looking macroeconomic factors (in particular, those conditions directly affecting the profitability and financial strength of our customers), and collateral value. No single factor determines the adequacy of the allowance. Different assumptions or changes in forward-looking economic assumptions would result in changes to the allowance for credit losses and the provision for credit losses. These qualitative factors are subjective and require a degree of management judgment. We believe our allowance is sufficient to provide for losses in our receivable portfolio as of September 30, 2024. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following discussion of liquidity and capital resources principally focuses on our statements of cash flows, balance sheets and capitalization. CNH Capital s current funding strategy is to maintain sufficient liquidity and flexible access to a wide variety of financial instruments and funding options. In the past, securitization has been one of our most economical sources of funding and, therefore, the majority of our originated receivables are securitized, with the cash generated from such receivables utilized to repay the related debt or purchase new receivables. In addition, we have secured and unsecured facilities, a repurchase agreement, commercial paper, unsecured bonds, affiliate borrowings and cash to fund our liquidity needs.

The decrease in net cash used for investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the decreases in net expenditures for receivables, affiliated cash pooling receivables and affiliated notes receivables of 704.8 million, 155.2 million and 16.8 million, respectively, partially offset by the increase in net expenditures for equipment on operating leases of 53.1 million. The decrease in net cash from financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to increases in net cash paid on external borrowings and affiliated debt of 765.3 million and 262.0 million, respectively, higher dividends paid of 100.0 million and a decrease in capital contributions of 25.0 million. Securitization CNH Capital and its predecessor entities have been securitizing receivables since 1992.

 Credit Ratings Our ability to obtain funding is affected by credit ratings of our debt, which are closely related to the outlook for and the financial condition of CNH N.V., and the nature and availability of our support agreement with CNH N.V. To access public debt capital markets, we rely on credit rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term credit ratings to our securities as an indicator of credit quality for fixed income investors. A credit rating agency may change or withdraw our ratings based on its assessment of our current and future ability to meet interest and principal repayment obligations. Each agency s rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Lower credit ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs, including costs of derivative transactions, and reduced access to debt capital markets. Our current credit ratings are as follows: 

Senior Long-Term Short-Term Outlook S P Global Ratings BBB+ A-2 Stable Fitch Ratings BBB+ F2 Stable Moody's Investors Service Baa2 - Stable Affiliate Sources CNH Capital borrows, as needed, from CNH. This source of funding is primarily used to finance various assets and provides additional flexibility when evaluating market conditions and potential third-party financing options. We had affiliated debt of 39.6 million and 132.5 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Equity Position Our equity position also supports our ability to access various funding sources. Our stockholder s equity at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 1.7 billion and 1.6 billion, respectively.

 Liquidity While we expect securitization to continue to represent a material portion of our capital structure and affiliated borrowings to remain a marginal source of funding, we will continue to diversify our funding sources and expand our investor base to support our investment grade credit ratings. These diversified funding sources include committed asset-backed facilities, a repurchase agreement, unsecured notes, bank facilities and a commercial paper program. The liquidity available for use varies due to: (a) changes in origination volumes, reflecting the financing needs of our customers, and is influenced by the timing of any refinancing of underlying receivables; and (b) the execution of our funding strategy of maintaining a sufficient level of liquidity and flexible access to a wide variety of financial instruments.

There were no material changes to these policies or estimates during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this filing; including competitive strengths; business strategy; future financial position or operating results; budgets; projections with respect to revenue, income, capital expenditures, dividends, liquidity, capital structure or other financial items; costs; and plans and objectives of management regarding operations, products and services, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements also include statements regarding the future performance of CNH and its subsidiaries on a stand-alone basis. These statements may include terminology such as may, will, expect, could, should, intend, estimate, anticipate, believe, outlook, continue, remain, on track, design, target, objective, goal, forecast, projection, prospects, plan, or similar terminology. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. Rather, they are based on current views and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are outside our control and are difficult to predict. If any of these risks and uncertainties materialize (or they occur with a degree of severity that the Company is unable to predict) or other assumptions underlying any of the forward-looking statements prove to be incorrect, including any assumptions regarding strategic plans, the actual results or developments may differ materially from any future results or developments expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.

Table of Contents 
 Factors, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements include, among others: economic conditions in each of CNH s markets, including the significant uncertainty caused by geopolitical events; production and supply chain disruptions, including industry capacity constraints, material availability, and global logistics delays and constraints; the many interrelated factors that affect consumer confidence and worldwide demand for capital goods and capital goods-related products; changes in government policies regarding banking, monetary and fiscal policy; legislation, particularly pertaining to capital goods-related issues such as agriculture, the environment, debt relief and subsidy program policies, trade and commerce and infrastructure development; government policies on international trade and investment, including sanctions, import quotas, capital controls and tariffs; volatility in international trade caused by the imposition of tariffs, sanctions, embargoes, and trade wars; actions of competitors in the various industries in which CNH North America competes; development and use of new technologies and technological difficulties; the interpretation of, or adoption of new, compliance requirements with respect to engine emissions, safety or other aspects of CNH s products; labor relations; interest rates and currency exchange rates; inflation and deflation; energy prices; prices for agricultural commodities and material price increases; housing starts and other construction activity; our ability to obtain financing or to refinance existing debt; restrictive covenants in our debt agreements; actions by rating agencies concerning the ratings on our debt and asset-backed securities and the credit rating of CNH N.V.; price pressure on new and used equipment; security breaches, cybersecurity attacks, technology failures, and other disruptions to the information technology infrastructure of the Company and its CNH North America dealers; security breaches with respect to CNH s products; political and civil unrest; volatility and deterioration of capital and financial markets, including pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic); terrorist attacks in Europe and elsewhere; the remediation of the material weakness; our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from our business initiatives as part of CNH s strategic plan including targeted restructuring actions to optimize CNH s cost structure and improve the efficiency of its operations; CNH s failure to realize, or a delay in realizing, all of the anticipated benefits of its acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic alliances or divestitures and other similar risks and uncertainties, and our and CNH s success in managing the risks involved in the foregoing. Forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions relating to the factors described in this filing, which are sometimes based upon estimates and data received from third parties. Such estimates and data are often revised. Actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. CNH Capital expressly disclaims any intention or obligation to provide, update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in expectations or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which these forward-looking statements are based. Further information concerning CNH Capital, including factors that potentially could materially affect its financial results, is included in the Company s reports and filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). All future written and oral forward-looking statements by CNH Capital or persons acting on the behalf of CNH Capital are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained herein or referred to above. Additional factors could cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements included in the Company s filings with the SEC (including, but not limited to, the factors discussed in our 2023 Annual Report and subsequent quarterly reports). Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this report, our management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our President and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act of 1934. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that due to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting (better described below and respectively relating to the classification of certain items within our Statement of Cash Flows), our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024.

 Material Weaknesses A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As of September 30, 2023, as previously reported, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, which continued to persist until remediated as of September 30, 2024. The material weakness related to the design and implementation of IT general controls in the areas of user access limits and segregation of duties related to our ERP application. In addition, as of December 31, 2023, as previously reported, we determined that we have an additional material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, which persisted as of September 30, 2024. This material weakness relates to the design and implementation of general controls over classification in our Statement of Cash Flows of changes in certain intercompany and operating lease receivables from our investing activities, and of bond discounts and debt issuance costs from our debt financing activities. These control deficiencies have not resulted in the need to revise any previously published financial results. However, the classification deficiency in the Statement of Cash Flows, if not timely remediated, could impact the proper classification of certain amounts deriving from operating, investing or financing activities. These control deficiencies could have resulted in a misstatement of one or more account balances or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected, and accordingly, we determined that these control deficiencies constitute material weaknesses. Management s Remediation of the Material Weakness Relating to the Design and Implementation of IT General Controls In response to the identified material weakness relating to the design and implementation of IT general controls in certain areas related to our ERP application, we executed a remediation plan in which we designed, implemented, operated and tested new and updated controls, processes and procedures: 1. We enhanced our IT general controls framework that addresses risks associated with user access and security, application change management and IT operations by: 
 a. performing a review of all users with privileged access, validating as appropriate and correcting user access when inappropriate; b. performing a look-back review of actions taken by users identified with inappropriate access to assure no actions were taken by the user that would be deemed inappropriate or a material issue based on their job role; c. designing a new control to review privileged access as a continuous monitoring procedure; and d. redesigning and enhancing controls around the usage and monitoring of the firecall accounts. 
 2. We implemented compensating controls and provided focused training for control owners to help sustain effective control operations relating to segregation of duties to strengthen user access controls and security. 
 As a result of the remediation activities and implementation of the new controls described above, we have remediated this material weakness as of September 30, 2024.

Table of Contents 
 Management s Plan to Remediate the Material Weakness Relating to the Classification of Certain Items Within Our Statement of Cash Flows Subsequent to the identification of the material weakness relating to the classification of certain items within our Statement of Cash Flows, we have been implementing measures and taking steps to address the underlying causes of the material weakness. Our management plans to enhance the Company s controls and review activity to assess and validate the classification of items in the operating, investing or financing sections within our Statement of Cash Flows. The Company s remediation plan is expected to include the following actions: (i) reviewing and enhancing the Company s organizational structure including technical training and supervision of individuals responsible for the preparation and review of the Statement of Cash Flows; and (ii) engaging with third-party resources to assist with the enhancement and formalization of roles and review responsibilities related to the technical review process for the Statement of Cash Flows. While we believe these efforts have improved, and will continue to improve, our internal controls and address the underlying causes of the material weakness, the material weakness will not be remediated until our remediation plans have been fully implemented and tested and we have concluded that following the improvements to our internal controls, our current control environment is operating effectively for a sufficient period of time. In particular, the enhanced compensating controls and training will require time to test and assess. We cannot be certain that the steps we are taking will be sufficient to remediate the control deficiencies that led to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or prevent future material weaknesses or control deficiencies from occurring. In addition, we cannot be certain that we have identified all material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, or that in the future we will not have additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting As described above, the Company is taking steps to remediate the remaining material weakness noted above. Other than in connection with these remediation steps, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to the costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our Company have been detected. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings CNH Capital is party to various litigation matters and claims arising from its operations. Management believes that the outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on CNH Capital s financial position or results of operations. Item 1A. Risk Factors See our most recent annual report on Form 10-K (Part I, Item 1A). There was no material change in our risk factors during the three months ended September 30, 2024.
