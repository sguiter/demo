 (2) Current year disclosure has been expanded to separately state model delivery revenue. Prior periods have been updated to conform to current year presentation. 
 The following discussion describes the nature, timing, and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows arising from the Company s contracts with customers on a consolidated basis. 
 Management and Financial Advice Fees 
 Asset Management Fees 
 The Company earns revenue for performing asset management services for retail and institutional clients (assets under management). The Company also earns revenue for performing advisory services for model portfolios that the Company does not have full discretionary investment authority (assets under advisement). The revenue is earned based on a fixed or tiered rate applied, as a percentage, to assets under management or advisement. Assets under management and advisement vary with market fluctuations and client behavior. The asset management and advisement performance obligation is considered a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and are satisfied each day over the contract term. Asset management fees are accrued, invoiced and collected on a monthly or quarterly basis. 
 The Company s asset management contracts for Open Ended Investment Companies OEICs in the United Kingdom U.K. and Soci t d'Investissement Capital Variable SICAVs in Europe include performance obligations for asset management and fund distribution services. The amounts received for these services are reported as Management and financial advice fees. The revenue recognition pattern is the same for both performance obligations as the fund distribution services revenue is variably constrained due to factors outside the Company s control including market volatility and client behavior (such as how long clients hold their investment) and not recognized until assets under management are known. 
 The Company may also earn performance-based management fees on institutional accounts, hedge funds, collateralized loan obligations CLOs ), OEICs, SICAVs and property and other funds based on a percentage of account returns in excess of either a benchmark index or a contractually specified level. This revenue is variable and impacted primarily by the performance of the assets being managed compared to the benchmark index or contractually specified level. The revenue is not recognized until it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur. Performance-based management fees are invoiced on a quarterly or annual basis.

 million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 The Company pays sales commissions to advisors when a new financial planning contract is obtained or when an existing contract is renewed. The sales commissions paid to the advisors prior to financial plan delivery are considered costs to obtain a contract with a customer and are initially capitalized. When the performance obligation to deliver the financial plan is satisfied, the commission is recognized as distribution expense. Capitalized costs to obtain these contracts are reported in Other assets and were million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Transaction and Other Fees 
 The Company earns revenue for providing customer support, shareholder and administrative services (including transfer agent services) for affiliated mutual funds and networking, sub-accounting and administrative services for unaffiliated mutual funds. The Company also receives revenue for providing custodial services and account maintenance services on brokerage and retirement accounts that are not included in an advisory relationship. Transfer agent and administrative revenue is earned based on either a fixed rate applied, as a percentage, to assets under management or an annual fixed fee for each fund position. Networking and sub-accounting revenue is earned based on either an annual fixed fee for each account or an annual fixed fee for each fund position. Custodial and account maintenance revenue is generally earned based on a quarterly or annual fixed fee for each account. Each of the customer support and administrative services performance obligations are considered a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and are satisfied each day over the contract term. Transaction and other fees (other than custodial service fees) are invoiced or charged to brokerage accounts on a monthly or quarterly basis. Custodial service fees are invoiced or charged to brokerage accounts on an annual basis. Contract liabilities for custodial service fees, which are included in Other liabilities, were million and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 The Company earns revenue for providing trade execution services to franchise advisors. The trade execution performance obligation is satisfied at the time of each trade and the revenue is primarily earned based on a fixed fee per trade. These fees are invoiced and collected on a semi-monthly basis. 
 Distribution Fees 
 Mutual Funds and Insurance and Annuity Products 
 The Company earns revenue for selling affiliated and unaffiliated mutual funds, fixed and variable annuities and insurance products. The performance obligation is satisfied at the time of each individual sale. A portion of the revenue is based on a fixed rate applied, as a percentage, to amounts invested at the time of sale. The remaining revenue is recognized over the time the client owns the investment or holds the contract and is generally earned based on a fixed rate applied, as a percentage, to the net asset value of the fund, or the value of the insurance policy or annuity contract. The ongoing revenue is not recognized at the time of sale because it is variably constrained due to factors outside the Company s control including market volatility and client behavior (such as how long clients hold their investment, insurance policy or annuity contract). This ongoing revenue may be recognized for many years after the initial sale. The revenue will not be recognized until it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur.

 Receivables 
 Receivables for revenue from contracts with customers are recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied and the Company has an unconditional right to the revenue. Receivables related to revenues from contracts with customers were million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 obligation to provide financial or other support to the non-consolidated VIEs beyond its initial investment and existing future funding commitments, and the Company has not provided any additional support to these entities. The Company has unfunded commitments related to consolidated CLOs of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Structured Investments 
 The Company invests in structured investments which are considered VIEs for which it is not the sponsor. These structured investments typically invest in fixed income instruments and are managed by third parties and include asset backed securities and commercial and residential mortgage backed securities. The Company classifies these investments as Available-for-Sale securities. The Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these structures due to the size of the Company s investment in the entities and position in the capital structure of these entities. 
 Additionally, the Company invests in CLOs for which it is the sponsor. CLOs are asset backed financing entities collateralized by a pool of assets, primarily syndicated loans and, to a lesser extent, high-yield bonds. Multiple tranches of debt securities are issued by a CLO, offering investors various maturity and credit risk characteristics. The debt securities issued by the CLOs are non-recourse to the Company. The CLO s debt holders have recourse only to the assets of the CLO. The assets of the CLOs cannot be used by the Company. Scheduled debt payments are based on the performance of the CLO s collateral pool. The Company earns management fees from the CLOs based on the value of the CLO s collateral pool and, in certain instances, may also receive incentive fees. The fee arrangement is at market and commensurate with the level of effort required to provide those services. The Company has invested in a portion of the unrated, junior subordinated notes and highly rated senior notes of certain CLOs. The Company consolidates certain CLOs where it is the primary beneficiary. 
 The Company s maximum exposure to loss with respect to structured investments and non-consolidated CLOs is limited to its amortized cost. The Company classifies these investments as Available-for-Sale securities. See Note 5 for additional information on these investments. 
 Other Non-Consolidated VIEs 
 The Company s investments in other non-consolidated VIEs are recorded in other investments. The Company s maximum exposure to loss with respect to its investments in these non-consolidated VIEs is limited to its carrying value. The carrying value of other non-consolidated VIEs was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company s liability related to original purchase commitments not yet remitted to the VIEs was not material as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company has not provided any additional support to the VIEs beyond the funding commitments. 
 Property Funds, Non-U.S. Series Funds, Hedge Funds and other Private Funds 
 The Company provides investment advice and other related services to property funds, non-U.S. series funds, hedge funds and other private funds, some of which are considered VIEs. For investment management services, the Company generally earns management fees based on the market value of assets under management, and in certain instances may also receive performance-based fees. The fee arrangements are at market and commensurate with the level of effort required to provide those services. The Company does not have a significant economic interest and is not required to consolidate any of these funds. 
 Affordable Housing Partnerships and Other Real Estate Partnerships 
 The Company is a limited partner in affordable housing partnerships that qualify for government-sponsored low income housing tax credit programs and partnerships that invest in multi-family residential properties that were originally developed with an affordable housing component. The Company has determined it is not the primary beneficiary and therefore does not consolidate these partnerships. A majority of the limited partnerships are VIEs. 
 Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities 
 The Company categorizes its fair value measurements according to a three-level hierarchy. See Note 12 for the definition of the three levels of the fair value hierarchy.

 Securities and loans transferred from Level 3 primarily represent assets with fair values that are now obtained from a third-party pricing service with observable inputs or priced in active markets. Securities and loans transferred to Level 3 represent assets with fair values that are now based on a single non-binding broker quote. 
 All Level 3 measurements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were obtained from non-binding broker quotes where unobservable inputs utilized in the fair value calculation are not reasonably available to the Company. 
 Determination of Fair Value 
 Assets 
 Investments 
 The fair value of syndicated loans obtained from third-party pricing services using a market approach with observable inputs is classified as Level 2. The fair value of syndicated loans obtained from third-party pricing services with a single non-binding broker quote as the underlying valuation source is classified as Level 3. The underlying inputs used in non-binding broker quotes are not readily available to the Company. See Note 12 for a description of the Company s determination of the fair value of corporate debt securities, common stocks and other investments. 
 Receivables 
 For receivables of the consolidated CLOs, the carrying value approximates fair value as the nature of these assets has historically been short-term and the receivables have been collectible. The fair value of these receivables is classified as Level 2. 
 Liabilities 
 Debt 
 The fair value of the CLOs assets, typically syndicated bank loans, is more observable than the fair value of the CLOs debt tranches for which market activity is limited and less transparent. As a result, the fair value of the CLOs debt is set equal to the fair value of the CLOs assets and is classified as Level 2. 
 Other Liabilities 
 Other liabilities consist primarily of securities purchased but not yet settled by consolidated CLOs. The carrying value approximates fair value as the nature of these liabilities has historically been short-term. The fair value of these liabilities is classified as Level 2. Other liabilities also include accrued interest on CLO debt. 
 Fair Value Option 
 The Company has elected the fair value option for the financial assets and liabilities of the consolidated CLOs. Management believes that the use of the fair value option better matches the changes in fair value of assets and liabilities related to the CLOs.

 As part of the Company s ongoing monitoring process, management determined that the decrease in total gross unrealized losses on its Available-for-Sale securities for which an allowance for credit losses has not been recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily attributable to the impact of lower interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not recognize these unrealized losses in earnings because it was determined that such losses were due to non-credit factors. The Company does not intend to sell these securities and does not believe that it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell these securities before the anticipated recovery of the remaining amortized cost basis.

 (1) The utilization of guaranteed withdrawals represents the percentage of contractholders that will begin withdrawing in any given year. The weighted average utilization rate represents the average assumption, weighted based on the benefit base. The calculation excludes policies that have already started taking withdrawals. 
 (2) The weighted average surrender rate represents the average assumption weighted based on the account value of each contract. 
 (3) Market volatility represents the implied volatility of each contractholder s mix of funds. The weighted average market volatility represents the average volatility across all contracts, weighted by the size of the guaranteed benefit. 
 (4) The nonperformance risk is the spread added to the U.S. Treasury curve. 
 (5) The weighted average mortality rate represents the average assumption weighted based on the account value of each contract. 
 Changes to Significant Inputs and Assumptions: 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and year ended December 31, 2023, the Company updated inputs and assumptions based on management s review of experience studies. These updates resulted in the following notable changes in the fair value estimates of market risk benefits calculations: 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 
 Updates to utilization of guaranteed withdrawal assumptions resulted in a decrease to pre-tax income of million. 
 Updates to surrender assumptions resulted in a decrease to pre-tax income of million. 
 Year ended December 31, 2023 
 Updates to utilization of guaranteed withdrawal assumptions resulted in a decrease to pre-tax income of million. 
 Updates to surrender assumptions resulted in a decrease to pre-tax income of million. 
 Refer to the rollforward of market risk benefits for the impacts of changes to interest rate, equity market, volatility and nonperformance risk assumptions. 
 Uncertainty of Fair Value Measurements 
 Significant increases (decreases) in utilization and volatility used in the fair value measurement of market risk benefits in isolation would have resulted in a significantly higher (lower) liability value. 
 Significant increases (decreases) in nonperformance risk and surrender assumptions used in the fair value measurement of market risk benefits in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) liability value. 
 Significant increases (decreases) in mortality assumptions used in the fair value measurement of the death benefit portion of market risk benefits in isolation would have resulted in a significantly higher (lower) liability value whereas significant increases (decreases) in mortality rates used in the fair value measurement of the life contingent portion of market risk benefits in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) liability value. 
 Surrender assumptions, utilization assumptions and mortality assumptions vary with the type of base product, type of rider, duration of the policy, age of the contractholder, calendar year of the projection, previous withdrawal history, and the relationship between the value of the guaranteed benefit and the contract accumulation value. 
 Determination of Fair Value 
 The Company values market risk benefits using internal valuation models. These models include observable capital market assumptions and significant unobservable inputs related to implied volatility, contractholder behavior assumptions that include margins for risk, and the Company s nonperformance risk. These measurements are classified as Level 3.

 million. Currently, the longest period of time over which the Company is hedging exposure to the variability in future cash flows is years and relates to forecasted debt interest payments. See Note 15 for a rollforward of net unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives included in AOCI related to cash flow hedges. 
 Net Investment Hedges 
 The Company entered into, and designated as net investment hedges in foreign operations, forward contracts to hedge a portion of the Company s foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with its investment in Threadneedle. As the Company determined that the forward contracts are effective, the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized in AOCI as part of the foreign currency translation adjustment. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized a loss of million and a gain of million, respectively, in other comprehensive income (loss) OCI ). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized a loss of million and a loss of million, respectively, in OCI. 
 Credit Risk 
 Credit risk associated with the Company s derivatives is the risk that a derivative counterparty will not perform in accordance with the terms of the applicable derivative contract. To mitigate such risk, the Company has established guidelines and oversight of credit risk through a comprehensive enterprise risk management program that includes members of senior management. Key components of this program are to require preapproval of counterparties and the use of master netting and collateral arrangements whenever practical. See Note 13 for additional information on the Company s credit exposure related to derivative assets.

 and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company s effective tax rate was and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was lower than the statutory rate as a result of tax preferred items including the dividends received deduction, incentive compensation, partially offset by state income taxes, net of federal benefit. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was lower than the statutory rate as a result of tax preferred items including incentive compensation, the dividends received deduction, foreign tax credits, net of addback, and low income housing tax credits, partially offset by state income taxes, net of federal benefit. 
 The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was higher than the statutory rate as a result of state income taxes, net of federal benefit. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was lower than the statutory rate as a result of tax preferred items including incentive compensation, partially offset by state income taxes, net of federal benefit. 
 The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to lower pretax income in the current period compared to the prior period and the related impact on tax preferred items, a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits, and a decrease in foreign taxes, partially offset by an increase in state income taxes, net of federal benefit. 
 Included in the Company s deferred income tax assets are tax benefits related to foreign net operating losses of million, which do not expire, federal tax credit carryforwards of million, which do not expire, and state net operating losses of million, net of federal benefit, which will expire beginning December 31, 2024. 
 The Company is required to establish a valuation allowance for any portion of its deferred tax assets that management believes will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in determining if a valuation allowance should be established and the amount of such allowance if required. Factors used in making this determination include estimates relating to the performance of the business. Consideration is given to, among other things in making this determination: (i) future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards; (ii) future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences; (iii) taxable income in prior carryback years; and (iv) tax planning strategies. Based on analysis of the Company s tax position as of September 30, 2024, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize certain state net operating losses of million, state deferred tax assets of million (both net of federal benefit), and foreign net operating losses of million; therefore, a valuation allowance has been established. The valuation allowance was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had million and million, respectively, of gross unrecognized tax benefits. If recognized, approximately million and million, net of federal tax benefits, of unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, would affect the effective tax rate. During the second quarter of 2023, the Company had additions to its gross unrecognized tax benefits for tax positions of prior years of million and reductions to its gross unrecognized tax benefits of prior years of million.

 million in the next 12 months primarily due to expected exam closures and state statutes of limitations expirations. 
 The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the income tax provision. The Company recognized a net increase of million and million in interest and penalties for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The Company recognized a net increase of million and million in interest and penalties for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had a payable of million and million, respectively, related to accrued interest and penalties. 
 The Company or one or more of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The Internal Revenue Service IRS is currently auditing the Company s U.S. income tax returns for 2019 and 2020. The Company s state income tax returns are currently under examination by various jurisdictions for years ranging from 2017 through 2021. 
 The Company is an applicable corporation required to compute corporate alternative minimum tax CAMT ). As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company recorded an estimate of million and , respectively, for the current provision of the CAMT. The provision was offset with a deferred tax asset for the CAMT credit carryover, which does not expire, resulting in no impact to the total tax provision. The estimate is based on interpretations and assumptions of available guidance the Company has made regarding the CAMT provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The U.S. Department of the Treasury issued proposed CAMT regulations in the current quarter. The proposed regulations are subject to public review and comment prior to finalizing. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of the proposed regulations. 
 In December 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development published the Pillar Two model rules which introduce new taxing mechanisms aimed at ensuring multinational enterprises pay a minimum level of tax on profits from each jurisdiction in which they operate. Various jurisdictions that the Company operates in have enacted or substantively enacted legislation that became effective beginning January 1, 2024. The Company intends to rely on Pillar Two transitional safe harbors where available and, based on its current estimate, has not recorded any Pillar Two tax liabilities. The Company continues to monitor the adoption and implementation of these rules and evaluate the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements.

 reporting segments are Advice Wealth Management, Asset Management, Retirement Protection Solutions and Corporate Other. 
 The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those of the Company, except for operating adjustments defined below, the method of capital allocation, the accounting for gains (losses) from intercompany revenues and expenses and not providing for income taxes on a segment basis. 
 Management uses segment adjusted operating measures in goal setting, as a basis for determining employee compensation and in evaluating performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. Consistent with GAAP accounting guidance for segment reporting, adjusted operating earnings is the Company s measure of segment performance. Adjusted operating earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP pretax income. The Company believes the presentation of segment adjusted operating earnings, as the Company measures it for management purposes, enhances the understanding of its business by reflecting the underlying performance of its core operations and facilitating a more meaningful trend analysis. 
 Adjusted operating earnings is defined as adjusted operating net revenues less adjusted operating expenses. Adjusted operating net revenues and adjusted operating expenses exclude net realized investment gains or losses (net of reinsurance accrual); the market impact on non-traditional long-duration products (including variable and fixed deferred annuity contracts and UL insurance contracts), net of hedges and reinsurance accrual; mean reversion related impacts (the impact on VUL products for the difference between assumed and updated separate account investment performance on the reinsurance accrual and additional insurance benefit reserves); the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate and currency changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments; block transfer reinsurance transaction impacts; gain or loss on disposal of a business that is not considered discontinued operations; integration and restructuring charges; and the impact of consolidating CIEs. The market impact on non-traditional long-duration products includes changes in market risk benefits and embedded derivative values caused by changes in financial market conditions, net of changes in economic hedge values and unhedged items including the difference between assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, fixed income credit exposures, transaction costs and certain policyholder contract elections. The market impact also includes certain valuation adjustments made in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure s, including the impact on embedded derivative values of discounting projected benefits to reflect a current estimate of the RiverSource Life companies nonperformance spread.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion and analysis of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the Forward-Looking Statements that follow and our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes presented in Item 1. Our Management s Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on February 22, 2024 2023 10-K ), as well as our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. References below to Ameriprise Financial, Ameriprise, the Company, we, us, and our refer to Ameriprise Financial, Inc. exclusively, to our entire family of companies, or to one or more of our subsidiaries. 
 
 Overview 
 Ameriprise Financial is a diversified financial services company with a 130-year history of providing financial solutions. We are a long-standing leader in financial planning and advice with 1.5 trillion in assets under management and administration as of September 30, 2024. We offer a broad range of products and services designed to achieve individual and institutional clients financial objectives. 
 The products and services we provide retail clients and, to a lesser extent, institutional clients, are the primary source of our revenues and net income. Revenues and net income are significantly affected by investment performance and the total value and composition of assets we manage and administer for our retail and institutional clients as well as the distribution fees we receive from other companies. These factors, in turn, are largely determined by overall investment market performance and the depth and breadth of our individual client relationships. 
 We operate our business in the broader context of the macroeconomic forces around us, including the global and U.S. economies, changes in interest and inflation rates, financial market volatility, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, geopolitical strain, pandemics, the competitive environment, client and customer activities and preferences, and the various regulatory and legislative developments. Financial markets and macroeconomic conditions have had and will continue to have a significant impact on our operating and performance results. In addition, the business, political and regulatory environments in which we operate are subject to elevated uncertainty and substantial, frequent change. Accordingly, we expect to continue focusing on our key strategic objectives and obtaining operational and strategic leverage from our core capabilities. The success of these and other strategies may be affected by the factors discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors in our 2023 10-K and other factors as discussed herein. 
 Equity price, credit market and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the values of market risk benefits and embedded derivatives associated with our variable annuities and the values of derivatives held to hedge these benefits and the spread income generated on our deposit products, fixed insurance, the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts and fixed deferred annuities. A higher (lower) interest rate environment may result in decreases (increases) to our long-duration contract reserves, which may impact our adjusted operating earnings after tax. For additional discussion on our interest rate risk, see Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 In the third quarter, we conducted our annual review of life insurance, annuity and long term care LTC valuation assumptions relative to current experience and management expectations including modeling changes. These annual assumption updates are collectively referred to as unlocking throughout this document. See our Consolidated and Segment Results of Operations sections for the pretax impacts on our revenues and expenses attributable to unlocking. 
 We consolidate certain variable interest entities for which we provide asset management services. These entities are defined as consolidated investment entities CIEs ). While the consolidation of the CIEs impacts our balance sheet and income statement, our exposure to these entities is unchanged and there is no impact to the underlying business results. For further information on CIEs, see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The results of operations of the CIEs are reflected in the Corporate Other segment. On a consolidated basis, the management fees we earn for the services we provide to the CIEs and the related general and administrative expenses are eliminated and the changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities related to the CIEs, primarily syndicated loans and debt, are reflected in Net investment income. We include the fees from these entities in the Management and financial advice fees line within our Asset Management segment. 
 While our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ), management believes that adjusted operating earnings measures, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, net of reinsurance accrual; the market impact on non-traditional long-duration products (including variable and fixed deferred annuity contracts and universal life UL insurance contracts), net of hedges and the reinsurance accrual; mean reversion related impacts (the impact on variable universal life VUL products for the difference between assumed and updated separate account investment performance on the reinsurance accrual and additional insurance benefit reserves); the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate and currency changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments; block transfer reinsurance transaction impact; gain or loss on disposal of a business that is not considered discontinued operations; integration and restructuring charges; income (loss) from

 discontinued operations; and the impact of consolidating CIEs, best reflect the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitate a more meaningful trend analysis. 
 The market impact on non-traditional long-duration products includes changes in market risk benefits and embedded derivative values caused by changes in financial market conditions, net of changes in economic hedge values and unhedged items including the difference between assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, fixed income credit exposures, transaction costs and certain policyholder contract elections. The market impact also includes certain valuation adjustments made in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure s, including the impact on embedded derivative values of discounting projected benefits to reflect a current estimate of our life insurance subsidiary s nonperformance spread. 
 In the first quarter of 2023, management introduced an adjusted capital measure Available Capital for Capital Adequacy ), which management believes best reflects the available capital resources of our core operations and facilitates a meaningful trend analysis. Available Capital for Capital Adequacy adjusts GAAP total equity and excludes accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI goodwill and intangibles; RiverSource Life Insurance Company s GAAP equity excluding AOCI; and includes RiverSource Life Insurance Company s statutory total adjusted capital prepared in conformity with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the State of Minnesota Department of Commerce; and other adjustments, primarily certain deferred tax balances. 
 Management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance and available capital on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. Also, certain of these non-GAAP measures are taken into consideration, to varying degrees, for purposes of business planning and analysis and for certain compensation-related matters. Throughout our Management s Discussion and Analysis, these non-GAAP measures are referred to as adjusted operating measures. These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as a substitute for U.S. GAAP measures. 
 It is management s priority to increase shareholder value over a multi-year horizon by achieving our on-average, over-time financial targets. 
 Our financial targets are: 
 Adjusted operating earnings per diluted share growth of 12 to 15 , and 
 Adjusted operating return on equity of over 30 .

 Overall 
 Pretax income decreased 472 million, or 42 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period. The following impacts were significant drivers of the period-over-period change in pretax income: 
 The market impact on non-traditional long duration products (including variable and fixed deferred annuity contracts and UL insurance contracts), net of hedges and the reinsurance accrual was an expense of 402 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a benefit of 211 million for the prior year period. 
 An unfavorable impact from the cumulative impact of Asset Management net outflows. 
 A favorable impact from the trend in rising investment portfolio yields, along with higher balances in Ameriprise Bank, FSB Ameriprise Bank customer deposits and structured variable annuities SVA products.

The primary driver of the unlocking impact was lowered surrender assumptions on variable annuities with living benefits resulting in an expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net Revenues 
 Management and financial advice fees increased 286 million, or 13 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period reflecting market appreciation and wrap account net inflows, partially offset by the cumulative impact of Asset Management net outflows. 
 Distribution fees increased 50 million, or 11 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily due to higher transactional activity and market appreciation, partially offset by 26 million of lower fees on off-balance sheet brokerage cash. 
 Net investment income increased 125 million, or 15 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items: 
 The favorable impact of growth in Ameriprise Bank customer deposits and SVA products. 
 The favorable impact of the trend in rising investment portfolio yields. 
 Banking and deposit interest expense increased 12 million, or 8 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting higher average crediting rates on certificates and Ameriprise Bank cash deposits. 
 Expenses 
 Distribution expenses increased 242 million, or 19 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting higher market appreciation and higher transactional activity. 
 Interest credited to fixed accounts decreased 21 million, or 15 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items: 
 A 20 million decrease in expense from other market impacts on indexed universal life IUL benefits, net of hedges, which was a benefit of 35 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a benefit of 15 million for the prior year period. The decrease in expense was primarily due to a decrease in the IUL embedded derivative in the current period, which reflected model changes and lower option costs due to a lower new money rate, offset by less discounting due to lower Treasury rates. 
 A 3 million increase in expense from the unhedged nonperformance credit spread risk adjustment on IUL benefits. The unfavorable impact of the nonperformance credit spread was 5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an unfavorable impact of 2 million for the prior year period. 
 Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased 310 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting a 221 million increase in expense from market impacts on SVA embedded derivative, net of

 hedges in place to offset those risks. This increase was primarily the result of an unfavorable 683 million change in the market impact on SVA embedded derivative and a favorable 464 million change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the SVA embedded derivative. The main market driver contributing to these changes was the equity market impact on the SVA embedded derivative net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in an expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a benefit in the prior year period. The increase in expense also reflects the impact of increased volume in SVAs and the impact of higher sales of life contingent payout annuities. 
 Change in fair value of market risk benefits increased 398 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items: 
 A 401 million increase in expense from other market impacts on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges in place to offset those risks. This increase was the result of an unfavorable 983 million change in the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits reserves, partially offset by a favorable 595 million change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the variable annuity guaranteed benefits. The main market drivers contributing to these changes are summarized below: 
 Equity market impact on the variable annuity guaranteed benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an expense in the prior year period. 
 Interest rate and bond impact on the variable annuity guaranteed benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in an expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a benefit in the prior year period. 
 Volatility impact on the variable annuity guaranteed benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an expense in the prior year period. 
 Other unhedged items, including the difference between the assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, transaction costs and various behavioral items, were a higher net expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period. 
 General and administrative expense increased 25 million, or 3 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily due to 17 million of higher severance expense, expenses to accelerate our transition to cloud-based technology, higher compensation accruals related to strong performance and the mark-to-market impacts on share-based compensation, partially offset by our continued focus on operational efficiency and effectiveness and a 20 million accrual for a regulatory matter relating to electronic communication recordkeeping requirements in the prior year period. 
 Income Taxes 
 Our effective tax rate was 20.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 21.8 for the prior year period. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to lower pretax income in the current period compared to the prior period and the related impact on tax preferred items, a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits, and a decrease in foreign taxes, partially offset by an increase in state income taxes, net of federal benefit. See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on income taxes.

 Net Revenues 
 Management and financial advice fees increased 805 million, or 12 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period reflecting market appreciation and continued wrap account net inflows, partially offset by the cumulative impact of Asset Management net outflows. 
 Distribution fees increased 62 million, or 4 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period due to market appreciation and strong transactional activity, partially offset by 146 million of lower fees on off-balance sheet brokerage cash. 
 Net investment income increased 438 million, or 19 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting: 
 The favorable impact of growth in Ameriprise Bank customer deposits and SVA products, along with higher average certificate balances. 
 The favorable impact of the trend in rising investment portfolio yields. 
 Premiums, policy and contract charges increased 45 million, or 4 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period due to higher sales of life contingent payout annuities. 
 Banking and deposit interest expense increased 129 million, or 34 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting higher average crediting rates and higher average volumes on certificates and Ameriprise Bank cash deposits. 
 Expenses 
 Distribution expenses increased 637 million, or 17 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting higher advisor compensation from higher average wrap account assets and increased transactional activity, as well as continued investments in recruiting experienced advisors. 
 Interest credited to fixed accounts decreased 29 million, or 6 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items: 
 A 39 million decrease in expense from other market impacts on IUL benefits, net of hedges, which was a benefit of 23 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an expense of 16 million for the prior year period. The decrease in expense was primarily due to a decrease in the IUL embedded derivative in the current period, which reflected model changes and more discounting due to higher Treasury rates, partially offset by higher option costs due to a higher option budget. 
 A 23 million increase in expense from the unhedged nonperformance credit spread risk adjustment on IUL benefits. The unfavorable impact of the nonperformance credit spread was 17 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a favorable impact of 6 million for the prior year period. 
 Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased 308 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting a 130 million increase in expense from market impacts on SVA embedded derivative, net of hedges in place to offset those risks. This increase was primarily the result of a favorable 804 million change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the SVA embedded derivative and an unfavorable 916 million change in the market impact on SVA embedded derivative. The main market driver contributing to these changes was the equity market impact on the SVA embedded derivative net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a higher expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period. This increase also reflects the impact of higher sales of life contingent payout annuities and increased volume in SVAs.

 A 69 million increase in expense from market impacts on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges in place to offset those risks. This increase was the result of an unfavorable 437 million change in the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits reserves and a favorable 392 million change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the variable annuity guaranteed benefits. The main market drivers contributing to these changes are summarized below: 
 Equity market impact on the variable annuity guaranteed benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a higher benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period. 
 Interest rate and bond impact on the variable annuity guaranteed benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in an expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a benefit for the prior year period. 
 Volatility impact on the variable annuity guaranteed benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a higher expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period.

 Fair Value Measurements 
 We report certain assets and liabilities at fair value; specifically, separate account assets, derivatives, market risk benefits, embedded derivatives, and most investments and cash equivalents. Fair value assumes the exchange of assets or liabilities occurs in orderly transactions and is not the result of a forced liquidation or distressed sale. We include actual market prices, or observable inputs, in our fair value measurements to the extent available. Broker quotes are obtained when quotes from pricing services are not available. We validate prices obtained from third parties through a variety of means such as: price variance analysis, subsequent sales testing, stale price review, price comparison across pricing vendors and due diligence reviews of vendors. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our fair value measurements. 
 Fair Value of Liabilities and Nonperformance Risk 
 Companies are required to measure the fair value of liabilities at the price that would be received to transfer the liability to a market participant (an exit price). Since there is not a market for our obligations of our market risk benefits, fixed deferred indexed annuities, structured variable annuities, and IUL insurance, we consider the assumptions participants in a hypothetical market would make to reflect an exit price. As a result, we adjust the valuation of market risk benefits, fixed deferred indexed annuities, structured variable annuities, and IUL insurance by updating certain contractholder assumptions, adding explicit margins to provide for risk, and adjusting the rates used to discount expected cash flows to reflect a current market estimate of our nonperformance risk. The nonperformance risk adjustment is based on observable market data adjusted to estimate the risk of our life insurance company subsidiaries not fulfilling these liabilities. Consistent with general market conditions, this estimate resulted in a spread over the U.S. Treasury curve as of September 30, 2024. As our estimate of this spread widens or tightens, the liability will decrease or increase, respectively. If this nonperformance credit spread moves to a zero spread over the U.S. Treasury curve, the reduction to future total equity would be approximately 639 million, net of the reinsurance accrual and income taxes (calculated at the statutory tax rate of 21 ), based on September 30, 2024 credit spreads. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had Available Capital for Capital Adequacy of 5.5 billion and 5.4 billion, respectively. Available Capital for Capital Adequacy best reflects the available capital resources of our core operations. 
 We maintained substantial liquidity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 10.6 billion and 7.5 billion, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents excluding CIEs and other restricted cash on a consolidated basis. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the parent company had 1.4 billion and 544 million, respectively, in cash, cash equivalents, and unencumbered liquid securities. Liquid securities predominantly include U.S. government agency mortgage backed securities. Additional sources of liquidity at the parent company include a line of credit with an affiliate up to 714 million and an unsecured revolving committed credit facility for up to 1.0 billion that expires in June 2026. Management s estimate of liquidity available to the parent company in a volatile and uncertain economic environment as of September 30, 2024 was 2.6 billion which includes cash, cash equivalents, unencumbered liquid securities, the line of credit with an affiliate and a portion of the committed credit facility. 
 Under the terms of the committed credit facility, we can increase the availability to 1.25 billion upon satisfaction of certain approval requirements. Available borrowings under this facility are reduced by any outstanding letters of credit. At September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and had 1 million of letters of credit issued against the facility. Our credit facility contains various administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants. We remained in compliance with all such covenants at September 30, 2024. 
 In addition, we have access to collateralized borrowings, which may include repurchase agreements, Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB advances, and advances at the Federal Reserve. Our subsidiaries, RiverSource Life Insurance Company RiverSource Life ), and Ameriprise Bank are members of the FHLB of Des Moines, which provides access to collateralized borrowings. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 8.5 billion and 8.6 billion, respectively, of estimated borrowing capacity under the FHLB facilities, of which 201 million was outstanding as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and is collateralized with commercial mortgage backed securities and residential mortgage backed securities. In addition, Ameriprise Bank maintains access to borrowings from the Federal Reserve which are collateralized with residential mortgage backed securities, commercial mortgage backed securities and corporate debt securities. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we estimated 11.9 billion and 12.3 billion, respectively, of borrowing capacity from the Federal Reserve in addition to the FHLB capacity and there were no outstanding obligations.

 There have been no material changes to our contractual obligations disclosed in our 2023 10-K. 
 See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about our long-term debt maturities, including 550 million maturing in October 2024. 
 We believe cash flows from operating activities, available cash balances, our availability of internal and external borrowings, access to debt markets, and dividends from our subsidiaries will be sufficient to fund our short-term and long-term operating liquidity needs and stress requirements. 
 On August 16, 2022, federal legislation commonly referred to as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 IRA was enacted. We have evaluated the tax provisions of the IRA, the most significant of which are the corporate alternative minimum tax CAMT and the share repurchase excise tax. Both the CAMT and share repurchase tax were effective beginning in 2023. We are an applicable corporation required to compute CAMT; and, based on current estimates, we recorded a CAMT liability for 2024. The U.S. Department of the Treasury issued proposed CAMT regulations in the current quarter. The proposed regulations are subject to public review and comment prior to finalizing. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of the proposed regulations. We are a covered corporation subject to the 1 excise tax on the net shares repurchased. We have recorded in shareholders equity an estimate of the excise tax liability based on our interpretation of the current guidance. As additional guidance is issued related to the IRA, we will continue to evaluate any impact to our consolidated financial statements. 
 In December 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development published the Pillar Two model rules which introduce new taxing mechanisms aimed at ensuring multinational enterprises pay a minimum level of tax on profits from each jurisdiction in which they operate. Various jurisdictions in which we operate have enacted or substantively enacted Pillar Two legislation that became effective beginning January 1, 2024. We intend to rely on Pillar Two transitional safe harbors where available and, based on the current estimate, have not recorded any Pillar Two tax liabilities. We continue to monitor the adoption and implementation of these rules and evaluate the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
 Dividends from Subsidiaries 
 Ameriprise Financial is primarily a parent holding company for the operations carried out by our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Because of our holding company structure, our ability to meet our cash requirements, including the payment of dividends on our common stock, substantially depends upon the receipt of dividends or return of capital from our subsidiaries, particularly our life insurance subsidiary, RiverSource Life, our face-amount certificate subsidiary, Ameriprise Certificate Company ACC ), Ameriprise Bank, AMPF Holding, LLC, which is the parent company of our retail introducing broker-dealer subsidiary, Ameriprise Financial Services, LLC AFS and our clearing broker-dealer subsidiary, American Enterprise Investment Services, Inc. AEIS ), our transfer agent subsidiary, Columbia Management Investment Services Corp. CMIS ), our investment advisory company, Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC CMIA ), TAM UK International Holdings Ltd, which includes Ameriprise International Holdings GmbH within its organizational structure, and Columbia Threadneedle Investments UK International Ltd. The payment of dividends by many of our subsidiaries is restricted and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements. For example, RiverSource Life payments in excess of statutory unassigned funds require advanced notice to the Minnesota Department of Commerce MN DOC ), RiverSource Life s primary regulator, and are subject to potential disapproval. In addition, dividends and other distributions whose fair market value, together with that of other dividends or distributions made within the preceding 12 months, exceeds the greater of the previous year s statutory net gain from operations or 10 of the previous year-end statutory capital and surplus are referred to as extraordinary dividends. Extraordinary dividends also require advanced notice to MN DOC, and are subject to potential disapproval. 
 Our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Rule 15c3-1 provides an alternative net capital requirement which AEIS and AFS (significant broker dealers) have elected. Regulations require that minimum net capital, as defined, be equal to the greater of 250 thousand or 2 of aggregate debit items arising from client balances. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA may impose certain restrictions, such as restricting withdrawals of equity capital, if a member firm were to fall below a certain threshold or fail to meet minimum net capital requirements. 
 Ameriprise Bank is subject to regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency OCC and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in its role as insurer of its deposits. Ameriprise Bank is required to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), Tier 1 Capital to average assets (as defined), and under rules defined under the Basel III capital framework, Common equity Tier 1 capital CEIT to risk-weighted assets. Ameriprise Bank calculates these ratios under the Basel III standardized approach in order to assess compliance with both regulatory requirements and Ameriprise Bank s internal capital policies. As permitted under the rules of the Basel III capital framework, we have elected to exclude AOCI from the calculation of regulatory capital. 
 ACC is registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act ). ACC markets and sells investment certificates to clients. ACC is subject to various capital requirements under the 1940 Act, laws of the State of Minnesota 
 95

 AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. 

 and understandings with the SEC and the Minnesota Department of Commerce. The terms of the investment certificates issued by ACC and the provisions of the 1940 Act also require the maintenance by ACC of qualified assets. 
 Actual capital and the regulatory capital requirement for TAM UK International Holdings Ltd. and Columbia Threadneedle Investments UK International Ltd. are calculated and reported as a single consolidated group under TAM UK International Holdings Ltd. Required capital for these entities is predominantly based on the requirements specified by its regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority FCA ), under its Capital Adequacy Requirements for investment firms. 
 Actual capital and regulatory capital requirements for our wholly owned subsidiaries subject to regulatory capital requirements were as follows:

 In October 2023, the Federal Reserve Board FRB issued its final rule establishing a consolidated capital framework termed the Building Block Approach for savings and loan holding companies like Ameriprise Financial that are significantly engaged in insurance activities. The rule became effective January 1, 2024, with reporting to the FRB beginning in 2025. 
 In addition to the particular regulations restricting dividend payments and establishing subsidiary capitalization requirements, we take into account the overall health of the business, capital levels and risk management considerations in determining a strategy for payments to our parent holding company from our subsidiaries, and in deciding to use cash to make capital contributions to our subsidiaries. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of 3.2 billion (including 525 million from Ameriprise Bank, 600 million from RiverSource Life and 1.2 billion from AMPF Holding, LLC) and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of 95 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of 2.3 billion (including 500 million from RiverSource Life and 1.1 billion from AMPF Holding, LLC) and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of 277 million. 
 In 2009, RiverSource Life established an agreement to protect its exposure to Genworth Life Insurance Company GLIC for its reinsured LTC. In 2016, substantial enhancements to this reinsurance protection agreement were finalized. The terms of these confidential provisions within the agreement have been shared, in the normal course of regular reviews, with our domiciliary regulator and rating agencies. GLIC is domiciled in Delaware, so in the event GLIC was subjected to rehabilitation or insolvency proceedings, such proceedings would be located in (and governed by) Delaware laws. Delaware courts have a long tradition of respecting commercial and reinsurance affairs as well as contracts among sophisticated parties. Similar credit protections to what we have with GLIC have been tested and respected in Delaware and elsewhere in the United States, and as a result we believe our credit protections would be respected even in the unlikely event that GLIC becomes subject to rehabilitation or insolvency proceedings in Delaware. Accordingly, while no credit protections are perfect, we believe the correct way to think about the risks represented by our 
 96 

Index 
 AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. 

 counterparty credit exposure to GLIC is not the full amount of the gross liability that GLIC reinsures, but a much smaller net exposure to GLIC (if any that might exist after taking into account our credit protections). Thus, management believes that our agreement and offsetting non-LTC legacy arrangements with Genworth Financial, Inc. will enable RiverSource Life to recover on all net exposure in all material respects in the event of a rehabilitation or insolvency of GLIC. 
 
 Dividends Paid to Shareholders and Share Repurchases 
 We paid regular quarterly dividends to our shareholders totaling 444 million and 427 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. On October 23, 2024, we announced a quarterly dividend of 1.48 per common share. The dividend will be paid on November 15, 2024 to our shareholders of record at the close of business on November 4, 2024. 
 On July 24, 2023, our Board of Directors authorized an additional 3.5 billion for the repurchase of our common stock through September 30, 2025. As of September 30, 2024, we had 1.5 billion remaining under this share repurchase authorization. We intend to fund share repurchases through existing excess capital, future free cash flow generation and other customary financing methods. The share repurchase program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares, and depending on market conditions and other factors, these purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice. Acquisitions under the share repurchase program may be made in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or block trades or other means. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased a total of 3.8 million shares of our common stock at an average price of 426.72 per share. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 Cash flows of CIEs and restricted and segregated cash and cash equivalents are reflected in our cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. Cash held by CIEs is not available for general use by Ameriprise Financial, nor is Ameriprise Financial cash available for general use by its CIEs. Cash and cash equivalents segregated under federal and other regulations is held for the exclusive benefit of our brokerage customers and is not available for general use by Ameriprise Financial. 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased 3.7 billion to 6.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.5 billion for the prior year period primarily reflecting earnings from our fee based business operations, net cash inflows in brokerage deposits, lower income taxes paid, and higher investment income. 
 Investing Activities 
 Our investing activities primarily relate to our Available-for-Sale investment portfolio and in recent quarters is significantly affected by the net flows of our face amount certificates and bank deposit activity. 
 Net cash provided by investing activities was 232 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash used in investing activities of 7.3 billion for the prior year period. The increase in net cash provided by investing activities primarily reflects a 4.5 billion increase in proceeds from maturities, sinking fund payments and calls of Available-for-Sale securities, a 2.6 billion decrease in purchases of Available-for-Sale securities and a 1.1 billion increase in proceeds from sales of Available-for-Sale securities. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 3.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 4.0 billion for the prior year period. The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities primarily reflects a 4.8 billion decrease in net cash flows from investment certificates and a 2.4 billion decrease in the change in banking deposits, net due to the strong growth in the prior year period.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Market Risk 
 Our primary market risk exposures are interest rate, equity price, foreign currency exchange rate and credit risk. Equity price and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the spread income generated on our brokerage client cash balances, banking deposits, face-amount certificate products, fixed portion of our variable annuities and variable insurance contracts, fixed annuity and insurance contracts, the value of market risk benefits and other liabilities associated with our variable annuities and the value of derivatives held to hedge related benefits. 
 Market risk benefits continue to be managed by utilizing a hedging program which attempts to match the sensitivity of the assets with the sensitivity of the benefits. This approach works with the premise that matched sensitivities will produce a highly effective hedging result. Our comprehensive hedging program focuses mainly on first order sensitivities of assets and liabilities: Equity Market Level (Delta), Interest Rate Level (Rho) and Volatility (Vega). Additionally, various second order sensitivities are managed. We use various options, swaptions, swaps and futures to manage risk exposures. The exposures are measured and monitored daily, and adjustments to the hedge portfolio are made as necessary. 
 To evaluate interest rate and equity price risk, we perform sensitivity testing which measures the impact on pretax income from the sources listed below for a 12-month period following a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates or a hypothetical 10 decline in equity prices. The interest rate risk test assumes a sudden 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve, with rates then staying at those levels for the next 12 months. The equity price risk test assumes a sudden 10 drop in equity prices, with equity prices then staying at those levels for the next 12 months. In estimating the values of variable annuities, indexed annuities, indexed universal life IUL insurance and the associated hedging instruments, we assume no change in implied market volatility despite the 10 drop in equity prices. 
 The following tables present our estimate of the impact on pretax income from the above defined hypothetical market movements as of September 30, 2024: 
 Equity Price Decline 10 Equity Price Exposure to Pretax Income Before Hedge Impact Hedge Impact Net Impact (in millions) Asset-based management and distribution fees (1)

 (1) Excludes incentive income which is impacted by market and fund performance during the period and cannot be readily estimated. 
 (2) Represents the net impact to pretax income. The estimated net impact to pretax adjusted operating income is (353) million as of September 30, 2024. 
 99 

Index 
 AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. 

 The above results compare to an estimated negative net impact to pretax income of 332 million related to a 10 equity price decline and an estimated positive net impact to pretax income of 561 million related to a 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2023. 
 Net impacts shown in the above tables from market risk benefits result largely from differences between the liability valuation basis and the hedging basis. Liabilities are valued using fair value accounting principles, with risk margins incorporated in contractholder behavior assumptions. Our hedging is based on our determination of economic risk, which excludes certain items in the liability valuation. 
 Actual results could and likely will differ materially from those illustrated above as fair values have a number of estimates and assumptions. For example, the illustration above includes assuming that implied market volatility does not change when equity prices fall by 10 and that the 100 basis point increase in interest rates is a parallel shift of the yield curve. Furthermore, we have not tried to anticipate changes in client preferences for different types of assets or other changes in client behavior, nor have we tried to anticipate all strategic actions management might take to increase revenues or reduce expenses in these scenarios. 
 The selection of a 100 basis point interest rate increase as well as a 10 equity price decline should not be construed as a prediction of future market events. Impacts of larger or smaller changes in interest rates or equity prices will not be proportional to those shown for a 100 basis point increase in interest rates or a 10 decline in equity prices. 
 Fixed Annuities, Fixed Insurance and Fixed Portion of Variable Annuities and Variable Insurance Contracts 
 Our earnings from fixed deferred annuities, fixed insurance, and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts are based upon the spread between rates earned on assets held and the rates at which interest is credited to accounts. We primarily invest in fixed rate securities to fund the rate credited to clients. We guarantee an interest rate to the holders of these products. Investment assets and client liabilities generally differ as it relates to basis, repricing or maturity characteristics. Rates credited to clients accounts generally reset at shorter intervals than the yield on the underlying investments. Therefore, in an increasing interest rate environment, higher interest rates may be reflected in crediting rates to clients sooner than in rates earned on invested assets, which could result in a reduced spread between the two rates, reduced earned income and a negative impact on pretax income. While interest rates under the current environment have relieved some pressure from the liability guaranteed minimum interest rates GMIRs ), there are still some GMIRs above current levels. Hence, liability credited rates will move more slowly under a modest rise in interest rates while projected asset purchases would capture the full increase in interest rates. This dynamic would result in widening spreads under a modestly rising rate scenario given the current relationship between the current level of interest rates and the underlying GMIRs on the business. Of the 41.3 billion in Policyholder account balances, future policy benefits and claims as of September 30, 2024, 16.2 billion is related to liabilities created by these products. We do not hedge this exposure. 
 As a result of the current market environment, reinvestment yields are becoming more aligned with the current portfolio yield. We would expect the recent decline in our portfolio income yields to slow and begin to stabilize in future periods under the current environment. The carrying value and weighted average yield of non-structured fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgage loans that may generate proceeds to reinvest through September 30, 2026 due to prepayment, maturity or call activity at the option of the issuer, excluding securities with a make-whole provision, were 4.8 billion and 5.0 , respectively, as of September 30, 2024. In addition, residential mortgage backed securities, which can be subject to prepayment risk under a low interest rate environment, totaled 23.0 billion and had a weighted average yield of 4.6 as of September 30, 2024. While these amounts represent investments that could be subject to reinvestment risk, it is also possible that these investments will be used to fund liabilities or may not be prepaid and will remain invested at their current yields. In addition to the interest rate environment, the mix of benefit payments versus product sales as well as the timing and volumes associated with such mix may impact our investment yield. Furthermore, reinvestment activities and the associated investment yield may also be impacted by corporate strategies implemented at management s discretion. The average yield for investment purchases during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 5.4 . 
 The reinvestment of proceeds from maturities, calls and prepayments at rates near the current portfolio yield will have a limited impact to future operating results. In this volatile rate environment, we assess reinvestment risk in our investment portfolio and monitor this risk in accordance with our asset/liability management framework. In addition, we may update the crediting rates on our fixed products when warranted, subject to guaranteed minimums. 
 See Note 8 for more information on the account values of fixed deferred annuities, fixed insurance, and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts by range of GMIRs and the range of the difference between rates credited to policyholders and contractholders as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and the respective guaranteed minimums, as well as the percentage of account values subject to rate reset in the time period indicated.
