million US dollars to be injected and is a wholly owned by
foreign investment. 

Rubber
Leaf Inc (the Company or RLI was incorporated under the law of the State of Nevada on May 18, 2021 by Ms.
Xingxiu Hua, the sole shareholder of RLSP. On May 27, 2021, the Company entered a share exchange agreement with Ms. Hua, pursuant to
which, the Company issued shares of common stock to exchange for all of RLSP s shares. No change of control of RLSP
resulted from the execution of the share exchange agreement. 

ownership interest in Shanghai Xinsen and Shanghai Xinsen holds a 
ownership interest in Hangzhou Xinsen. The Xinsen Group serves as a certified second-tier supplier
for branded Automobile Manufacturers Auto Manufacturers ). A second-tier supplier refers to a supplier that provides products
to the first-tier suppliers of the OEM. First-tier suppliers could be suppliers of car doors, rubber and plastic components and other
automobile parts. Auto Manufacturers issue consolidated purchase orders for complete sets of rubber and plastic auto parts for a particular
model to their first-tier suppliers. These first-tier suppliers subcontract the production of rubber and plastic seals to second-tier
suppliers. As a second-tier supplier and a facilitator of production rather than a direct manufacturer, Xinsen Group coordinates with
us to fulfill orders. Upon receipt of purchase orders, RLSP procures rubber materials from our vendors. The production process involves
outsourcing to third-party manufacturers for either work-in-process products WIP or finished products, based on management s
decisions in response to operational circumstances. 

We
employ two distinct forms of outsourced processing under Model B. 

1) 
 RLSP
 purchases raw materials and subcontracts production to third-party manufacturers for WIP. Once WIP is finished and delivered to RLSP s
 warehouse, RLSP performs certain manual processes, such as welding and constructing in order to meet the specification of the purchase
 orders. The completion of the final products is contingent upon a rigorous quality inspection conducted by RLSP, ensuring they meet
 the highest standards. 

2) 
 RLSP
 purchases raw materials and subcontracts third party manufacturers to produce finished products. RLSP will trace and observe each
 step of production undertaken by third-party manufacturers, with a primary focus on the final quality control step. 

The
finished products are delivered to the warehouses of Xinsen Group s upstream first-tier suppliers, either from our locations or
those of the third-party manufacturers. Quality inspection is carried out by assigned inspectors from Xinsen Group upon delivery. RLSP
fulfills its obligation when the finished products reach Xinsen Group s customers and pass the qualified quality inspection. 

In
the event of products that do not pass inspection, the Xinsen Group initiates a product replacement process. Upon confirmation of quality
and quantity, and acceptance of finished products into Xinsen Group s customers warehouses, invoices are provided to us
as proof of delivery. The date of the invoices signifies the transfer of ownership and control of the finished products under model B
from us to Xinsen Group and indirectly to its upstream first-tier suppliers. We recognize at such time as Xinsen Group s customers
accept delivery of products. 

We also generate revenue through contract manufacturing model or OEM supply
model, which is described in the model C. 

Model
C (OEM Supply Model) 

The
contract manufacturing process begins with the customer placing an order and supplying all necessary raw materials. We provide the labor
and equipment required to process the raw materials into finished products. The customer is charged a processing fee, which is calculated
based on the cost per individual part and settled monthly. At the start of each month, we calculate the number of parts processed in
the previous month, and both parties confirm the quantity by stamping the relevant documents. Once confirmed, we issue an invoice for
the processing fee, and the customer makes payment upon receipt of the invoice.

million) in China. The cash transfer has been approved by Agricultural Bank of China, Fenghua Branch, which is authorized by the State
Administration of Foreign Exchange (the SAFE ). 

million. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, and 
cash has been transferred from the Company to RLSP as capital contribution, respectively. 

From
May to July 2023, the Company issued shares of common stocks at per share pursuant to the private placements with ten individuals
for cash. The total subscriptions were fully received as of September 30, 2024. The Company relied upon Regulation S of the

(RMB million), and the Project was completed
on October 25, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, RLSP has paid Ningbo Rongsen a total of (RMB million) for the Project. The
Project was subsequently audited by Ningbo Zhongxin Engineering Management Co., Ltd., which initially appraised the Project at US 
(RMB ). Based on this appraisal, RLSP signed a Settlement Payment Agreement with Ningbo Rongsen on January 7, 2024, setting
the final settlement price at US (RMB ). 

However,
a significant discrepancy emerged following a second evaluation by Kexin United Engineering Consulting Co., Ltd., which determined the
Project cost to be US (RMB ), indicating a discrepancy of 26.32 compared to the price in the Settlement Payment
Agreement. Citing a major misunderstanding influenced by the initial overvaluation, RLSP seeks legal action to revoke the Settlement
Payment Agreement, in accordance with Article 147 of the Civil Code of the People s Republic of China, which allows for the revocation
under significant misunderstanding. 

On
March 21, 2024, RLSP filed a complaint against Ningbo Rongsen in the Ningbo Fenghua District People s Court of China, challenging
the overvalued construction costs of our newly constructed factory. Concurrently with RLSP s complaint, on March 25, 2024, Ningbo
Rongsen filed a counter-claim against RLSP with the Ningbo Fenghua District People s Court demanding RLSP to pay full construction
costs, overdue penalty, attorney fees and other costs totalling US (RMB in accordance with the Settlement Payment
Agreement. The Ningbo Fenghua District People s Court accepted the above filings in connection with RLSP s complaint and
Ningbo Rongsen s counter-claim on May 9, 2024 and assigned a case number being (2024) Zhejiang 0213 Minchu No. 2289. Subsequently,
on July 26, 2024, the Ningbo Fenghua District People s Court ruled in favor of Ningbo Rongsen, ordering RLSP to pay full construction
costs, overdue penalty, attorney fees and other costs in accordance with the Settlement Payment Agreement. On August 9, 2024, RLSP appealed
to the Ningbo Intermediate People s Court, requesting the revocation of the civil court judgement in case number (2024) Zhejiang
0213 Minchu No. 2289. RLSP seeks either a remand of the case for retrial or a revised judgement that supports its claims and rejects
the counter-claim filed by Ningbo Rongsen. The case is currently under review by the Ningbo Intermediate People s Court. 

Our
management maintains confidence in our legal standing and is actively pursuing a resolution that will be beneficial to us. As legal proceedings
are subject to inherent uncertainties, we cannot predict the outcome of this matter at the time of filing this Quarterly Report.

For
U.S. income tax purposes, the Company has no cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiary as of September 30, 2024 after acquired
RLSP on May 27, 2021. Accordingly, no provision has been made for U.S. deferred taxes related to future repatriation of these earnings,
nor is it practicable to estimate the amount of income taxes that would have to be provided if we concluded that such earnings will be
remitted to the U.S. in the future. 

In
addition, the 2017 Tax Act also creates a new requirement that certain income (i.e., Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income GILTI ))
earned by controlled foreign corporations CFCs must be included currently in the gross income of the CFCs U.S.
shareholder. GILTI is the excess of the shareholder s net CFC tested income over the net deemed tangible income return, which is
currently defined as the excess of (1) 10 percent of the aggregate of the U.S. shareholder s pro rata share of the qualified business
asset investment of each CFC with respect to which it is a U.S. shareholder over (2) the amount of certain interest expense taken into
account in the determination of net CFC-tested income. The Company has elected to recognize the tax on GILTI as a period expense in the
period the tax is incurred. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, no GILTI tax expense was incurred. 

ASC
740 requires recognition and measurement of uncertain income tax positions using a more-likely-than-not approach. The management
evaluated the Company s tax positions and considered that no provision for uncertainty in income taxes was necessary as of September
30, 2024.

Overview 

Rubber
Leaf Inc was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on May 18, 2021. We acquired Rubber Leaf Sealing Products (Zhejiang)
Co., Ltd. on July 1, 2021, through an equity transfer between Rubber Leaf LLC and Rubber Leaf Inc. After the acquisition, RLSP became
our 100 directly controlled subsidiary and wholly foreign-owned enterprise in China. Currently, all of our business is conducted through
RLSP. RLSP was established in Fenghua, Ningo, China and commenced operations in July 2019. RLSP was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rubber
Leaf LLC, a Delaware company organized on June 1, 2018, and Xingxiu Hua was the sole member of Rubber Leaf LLC. RLSP specializes in the
production and sales of automotive rubber and plastic sealing strips. We are a well-known auto parts enterprise, and we are also a first-tier
supplier of well-known auto brands such as eGT and Volkswagen. 

Our
principal business address is located at Qixing Road, Weng ao Industrial Zone, Chunhu Subdistrict, Fenghua District Ningbo, Zhejiang,
China. 

Components
of Our Results of Operations 

Sales
Revenue 

We
generate revenue through selling automotive rubber and plastic sealing strips under two models of supply: 

Model
A (Direct Supply Model) 

Following
successful on-site inspections by auto OEMs, RLSP secures listing in its directories as a first-tier supplier that directly provides
products to the OEM. For example, eGT is an auto OEM, and we serve as their first-tier supplier. eGT directly signs purchase or supply
agreements with RLSP. This positions RLSP to independently procure raw materials, manufacture final products and directly deliver finished
goods to the warehouses of the auto OEMs. RLSP fulfills its performance obligation upon the delivery of finished products to their warehouses,
following a subsequent quality inspection approved by them. Simultaneously, they may request product replacements for disqualified items.
Ownership and control of our finished products transfer to customers upon successful inspection and acceptance into an OEM s warehouse.
Revenue recognition occurs upon the transfer of control of our products to a customer, with payments made directly by the OEM. 

23 

Model B (Indirect Supply Model) 

RLSP
receives the purchase orders from our related parties-Shanghai Xinsen and Xinsen Sealing Products (Hangzhou) Co., Ltd Hangzhou
Xinsen (collectively named as Xinsen Group for two companies together). The Company s Chief Executive Officer,
President and Chairperson, Ms. Xingxiu Hua, previously held a 90 ownership interest in Shanghai Xinsen and Shanghai Xinsen holds a 70 
ownership interest in Hangzhou Xinsen. Effective October 1, 2022, Ms. Hua reduced her ownership of Shanghai Xinsen from 90 to 15 , and
accordingly reduced her indirect ownership of Hangzhou Xinsen from 63 to 10.5 . The Xinsen Group is a rubber product trading expert
with 20 years of experience in the auto parts market, who charges 1 of the total sales amount before VAT tax as sales commission before
September 30, 2022, and subsequently 0.25 effective from October 1, 2022 after the renegotiation between RLSP and Xinsen Group. The
sales commission incurred in each period is recorded as part of selling expense of the Company. The Xinsen Group serves as a certified
second-tier supplier for branded Automobile Manufacturers Auto Manufacturers ). A second-tier supplier refers to a supplier
that provides products to the first-tier suppliers of the OEM. First-tier suppliers could be suppliers of car doors, rubber and plastic
components and other automobile parts. Auto Manufacturers issue consolidated purchase orders for complete sets of rubber and plastic
auto parts for a particular model to their first-tier suppliers. These first-tier suppliers subcontract the production of rubber and
plastic seals to second-tier suppliers. As a second-tier supplier and a facilitator of production rather than a direct manufacturer,
Xinsen Group coordinates with us to fulfill orders. Upon receipt of purchase orders, RLSP procures rubber materials from our vendors.
The production process involves outsourcing to third-party manufacturers for either work-in-process products WIP or finished
products, based on management s decisions in response to operational circumstances. 

We
employ two distinct forms of outsourced processing under Model B. 

1) 
 RLSP
 purchases raw materials and subcontracts production to third-party manufacturers for WIP. Once WIP is finished and delivered to RLSP s
 warehouse, RLSP performs certain manual processes, such as welding and constructing in order to meet the specification of the purchase
 orders. The completion of the final products is contingent upon a rigorous quality inspection conducted by RLSP, ensuring they meet
 the highest standards. 

2) 
 RLSP
 purchases raw materials and subcontracts third party manufacturers to produce finished products. RLSP will trace and observe each
 step of production undertaken by third-party manufacturers, with a primary focus on the final quality control step. 

The
finished products are delivered to the warehouses of Xinsen Group s upstream first-tier suppliers, either from our locations or
those of the third-party manufacturers. Quality inspection is carried out by assigned inspectors from Xinsen Group upon delivery. RLSP
fulfills its obligation when the finished products reach Xinsen Group s customers and pass the qualified quality inspection. 

In
the event of products that do not pass inspection, the Xinsen Group initiates a product replacement process. Upon confirmation of quality
and quantity, and acceptance of finished products into Xinsen Group s customers warehouses, invoices are provided to us
as proof of delivery. The date of the invoices signifies the transfer of ownership and control of the finished products under model B
from us to Xinsen Group and indirectly to its upstream first-tier suppliers. We recognize at such time as Xinsen Group s customers
accept delivery of products. 

We also generate revenue through contract
manufacturing model or OEM supply model, which is described in the model C. 

Model
C: OEM supply model 

The
contract manufacturing process begins with the customer placing an order and supplying all necessary raw materials. We provide the labor
and equipment required to process the raw materials into finished products. The customer is charged a processing fee, which is calculated
based on the cost per individual part and settled monthly. At the start of each month, we calculate the number of parts processed in
the previous month, and both parties confirm the quantity by stamping the relevant documents. Once confirmed, we issue an invoice for
the processing fee, and the customer makes payment upon receipt of the invoice. 

Related
Party Revenues 

We
also generate revenue through the indirect supply model. We process the purchase orders from our related parties, subcontract them to
third party suppliers, who will produce and deliver the finished products to the final customers. Specifically, we either purchase raw
materials and subcontract them for manufacturing or procure the products directly in the market to supply our customers, which depends
on the specific requirements of the orders. 

Cost
of Revenues 

Cost
of revenues is comprised of raw materials consumed, manufacturing costs, third party logistics and distribution costs including packaging,
freight, transportation, shipping and handling costs, and inventory adjustment due to the defectives and inventory count. 

Selling
Expense 

Selling
expense principally consist of costs associated with our sales force. Our main selling cost is the commission fee from indirect supply
model sales. 

General
and Administrative Expense 

General
and administrative expenses include the expenses for commercial support personnel, personnel in executive and other administrative functions,
other commercial costs necessary to support the commercial operation of our products, professional fees for legal, consulting and accounting
services. General and administrative expenses also include depreciation and impairments of office furniture and equipment. 

24 

Interest
Expense 

Interest
expense primarily consists of interest expense incurred under our Revolving Loan Agreement with banks, individual third parties, and
minor bank service charges. 

Income
taxes 

We
are governed by the Income Tax Law of the PRC, and the United States. We account for income tax using the liability method prescribed
by ASC 740, Income Taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference
between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect in the year in
which the differences are expected to reverse. We record a valuation allowance to offset deferred tax assets if based on the weight of
available evidence; it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect
on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or loss in the period that includes the enactment date.

Sales
Revenue 

Sales
revenue for the three months ending on September 30, 2024 and 2023 amounted to 2,003,681 and 1,810,341, respectively, marking an increase
of 0.19 million or 11 year over year. The increase was mainly attributed to the demand increase from the indirect supply model while
there was a decrease in demand from the direct supply. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, RLSP introduc ed an OEM supply model,
through which the customer places an order with us and sends over all raw materials. We provide the labor and equipment to process the
finished product. 

RLSP
initiated the relocation of its factory to our newly constructed facility in early August 2023 and subsequently obtained the property
title certificate in December 2023. As of September 2024, production under the direct supply model had not yet resumed at the new factory. The Company received its production
license certificate from the government on June 6, 2024, and plan ned
to arrange an inspection by eGT, which was expected to take approximately 2-3 months to complete. However, the profitability of exports
to Europe has been impacted by the recently imposed EU tariffs on cars produced in China. As a result, eGT s headquarters in France
is still in negotiations with its Chinese counterpart regarding the orders and tariffs. These ongoing inter-company discussions have led
to further delays in both the inspection process by eGT and order processing, with no orders resumed as of the third quarter of 2024. 

Cost
of Sales 

Cost
of sales were 2,184,808 and 1,983,537 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 0.2 million,
or 10 year over year. RLSP suspended production in July 2023 and resumed operations in July 2024. Although RLSP initiated an OEM supply
model upon resuming in July 2024, overall production capacity has not been fully utilized, resulting in an idle capacity loss of 161,902
for the three months ending September 30, 2024. 

If
the loss on idle capacity is not considered, our cost of sales increased by 39,369 for the three months ended on September 30, 2024
compared with the same quarter last year, which was mainly due to the increased cost of OEM supply model as well as the overall cost
of indirect supply model. 

Gross
profit (loss) 

Gross
profit (loss) were (181,127) and (173,196) for the three months ended on September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our revenue and
gross profit margin were presented as below:

The
overall gross profit margin remained stable for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The
gross margin for indirect supply models showed a slight increase, primarily due to reduced purchase costs in these sales compared to
the previous year. Since RLSP only began its OEM supply model in July 2024, production has yet to scale up due to limited customer orders. 

Selling
expenses 

Selling
expenses were 5,011 and 6,835 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, with a decrease of 1,824 or 27
 year over year. The decrease was mainly associated with the decrease in sales in our direct supply model. 

General
and administrative cost 

General
and administrative expenses were 213,632 and 124,130 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, increased
by 89,502, or 72 year over year. The increase was primarily attributed to the rise in professional service fees during the three months
ended September 30, 2024, stemming from the Company s application for uplisting to The Nasdaq Capital Market.

the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, loss from operations was (399,770) and (304,161), a decrease of 95,609 or 31 
year over year. The decrease in loss from operations was primarily due to the decrease in sales from our direct sales model client,
eGT and loss due to idle capacity for three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period of 2023. 

Net
loss 

As
a result of the factors described above, our net loss was (474,481) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 113,565
from the net loss of (360,916) for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Sales
Revenue 

Sales
revenue were 6,916,046 and 6,265,261 for the nine months ended on September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 0.65 million
or 10 year over year. The increase was mainly attributed to the demand increase from the indirect supply model while there was a decrease
in demand from the direct supply model. A s of September 2024, production under
the direct supply model had not yet resumed at the new factory. The Company received its production license certificate from the government
on June 6, 2024, and planned to arrange an inspection by eGT, which was expected to take approximately 2-3 months to complete. However,
the profitability of exports to Europe has been impacted by the recently imposed EU tariffs on cars produced in China. As a result, eGT s
headquarters in France is still in negotiations with its Chinese counterpart regarding the orders and tariffs. These ongoing inter-company
discussions have led to further delays in both the inspection process by eGT and order processing, with no orders resumed as of the third
quarter of 2024. In July 2024, RLSP adjusted its business strategy and introduced an OEC supply model, which is expected to generate revenue
for the Company in 2024. 

Cost
of Sales 

Cost
of sales were 7,451,955 and 6,137,529 for the nine months ended on September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 1.34
million, or 21 year over year. The increase was accompanied by increasing sales in the corresponding period. Besides, RLSP
suspended production in July 2023 and resumed operations in July 2024, which resulted in the loss of factory relocation of 359,549
during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Although RLSP initiated an OEM supply model upon resuming in July 2024, overall
production capacity has not been fully utilized, resulting in an idle capacity loss of 161,903 for the nine months ending September
30, 2024. 

Gross
profit (loss) 

Gross
profit (loss) were (535,909) and 127,732 for the nine months ended on September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our revenue and gross
profit margin were presented as below:

The
decrease in our overall gross profit margin, compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was mainly attributed
to the Company generating less sales from its direct supply model which has a higher gross profit margin as the Company has
suspended its direct supply model production since July 2023. Since RLSP only began its OEM supply model in July 2024, production
has yet to scale up due to limited customer orders, which leads to a low gross profit margin. 

Selling
expenses 

Selling
expenses were 20,311 and 66,670 for nine months ended on September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively, with a decrease of 46,356 or 70 
year over year. The decrease was mainly associated with the decrease in sales in the Company s direct supply model. 

General
and administrative cost 

General
and administrative expenses were 929,165 and 487,512 for the nine months ended on September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, increased
by 441,653, or 91 year over year. The increase was primarily attributed to the rise in professional service fees during the nine months
ended on September 30, 2024, stemming from the Company s application for uplisting to The Nasdaq Capital Market. 

28 

Loss
from Operations 

For
the nine months ended on September 30, 2024, loss from operations was (1,485,385), as compared to loss from operations of (426,450)
for the nine months ended on September 30, 2023, a decrease of 1,058,935 or 248 year over year. The decrease in income from operations
was primarily due to the decrease in sales from our direct sales model client, eGT and loss due to factory relocation and idle capacity
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Net Loss 

As
a result of the factors described above, our net loss was (1,773,183) for the nine months ended on September 30, 2024, decreased by
 1,181,654 from the net loss of (591,529) for the nine months ended on September 30,2023. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of (4,991,084). As of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 28,618 and negative working
capital of (12,730,616), compared to cash of 41,687 and a negative working capital of (11,300,145) on December 31, 2023. The decrease
in the working capital was primarily due to the decrease in accounts receivable from a related party of the Company. 

On
March 25, 2024, RLSP secured approval for a line of credit LOC from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Ningbo
National Gaoxin Branch, with a total amount of 7.75 million (RMB 56 million). RLSP used its new factory building and land use right
located at Qixing Road, Weng ao Industrial Zone, Chunhu Subdistrict, Fenghua District, Ningbo, Zhejiang, China as collateral pledged
for this LOC. The LOC can be utilized through separate loans and has a term of two years. As of November 5, 2024, RLSP still has RMB
26 million available to apply for using from the LOC. 

Cash Flow 

Cash Flow Activities 

Cash
decreased from 41,687 at December 31, 2023, to 28,618 at September 30, 2024, decreased by 13,069 or 31 . The decrease was
primarily due to the increased cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

As
of September 30, 2024, our total current assets amounted to 10,359,731, compared to 8,775,183 as of December 31, 2023. Concurrently,
our total current liabilities stood at 23,090,347, a slight increase from 20,075,328 as of December 31, 2023. 

Operating
Activities 

Net
cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was (2,233,478), compared to 147,597in the prior period,
primarily driven by increased net loss and accounts receivable from related parties for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Investing
Activities 

Net
cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was (236,222) compared to (2,364,359) in the prior period.
The decrease was primarily attributable to the decreased purchase of equipment and factory construction. 

Financing
Activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2,455,798 compared to cash provided by financing
activities of 985,496 in the prior period. The increase was primarily attributable to the increased new borrowings for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
The preparation of these financial statements requires making estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The estimates are based on historical experience
and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

29 

The
critical accounting policies are discussed in further detail in the notes to the unaudited financial statements appearing elsewhere in
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables us to provide
useful and reliable financial information about our operating results and financial condition. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

As
a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act ),
and in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, we are electing scaled disclosure reporting obligations and therefore are not required to provide
the information requested by this item. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are designed with an objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports
filed with the SEC, such as this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Disclosure controls are also designed with an objective of ensuring that such information
is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and President, in order to allow timely consideration
regarding required disclosures. 

The
evaluation of our disclosure controls by our principal executive officer included a review of the controls objectives and design,
the operation of the controls, and the effect of the controls on the information presented in this report. Our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and President, does not expect that disclosure controls can or will prevent or detect all errors and all
fraud, if any. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that
the objectives of the control system are met. Also, projections of any evaluation of the disclosure controls and procedures to future
periods are subject to the risk that the disclosure controls and procedures may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

As
of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with
the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and President and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act as of the end of the period
covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and President and Chief Financial Officer have concluded
that there were material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024 and they were therefore
not as effective as they could be to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. The
material weakness in our controls and procedure were lack of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) knowledge and segregation
duties. Management does not believe that any of these material weaknesses materially affected the results and accuracy of its financial
statements. However, in view of this discovery of such weaknesses, management has begun a review to improve them. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d)
of Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings. 

From
time to time, claims are made against us in the ordinary course of business, which could result in litigation. Claims and associated
litigation are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable outcomes could occur, such as monetary damages, fines, penalties, or
injunctions prohibiting us from selling one or more products or engaging in other activities. There were no reportable litigation events
and there have been no material developments to litigation events previously disclosed in our SEC filings during the quarter ended September
30, 2024 except as described below. 

On
August 5, 2022, RLSP signed a Construction Engineering Contract (the Project with Zhejiang Fengrong Construction Co.,
Ltd (a.k.a Ningbo Rongsen to construct a factory and a new production line with an annual production capacity of up to
four million sets of automotive seals. The budget of the Project is around 4,931,105 (RMB 35 million), and the Project was completed
on October 25, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, RLSP has paid Ningbo Rongsen a total of 2,395,142 (RMB 17 million) for the Project. The
Project was subsequently audited by Ningbo Zhongxin Engineering Management Co., Ltd., which initially appraised the Project at US 6,519,991
(RMB 46,277,593). Based on this appraisal, RLSP signed a Settlement Payment Agreement with Ningbo Rongsen on January 7, 2024, setting
the final settlement price at US 7,171,990 (RMB 50,905,352). 

However,
a significant discrepancy emerged following a second evaluation by Kexin United Engineering Consulting Co., Ltd., which determined the
Project cost to be US 5,221,922 (RMB 37,064,159), indicating a discrepancy of 26.32 compared to the price in the Settlement Payment
Agreement. Citing a major misunderstanding influenced by the initial overvaluation, RLSP seeks legal action to revoke the Settlement
Payment Agreement, in accordance with Article 147 of the Civil Code of the People s Republic of China, which allows for the revocation
under significant misunderstanding. 

On
March 21, 2024, RLSP filed a complaint against Ningbo Rongsen in the Ningbo Fenghua District People s Court of China, challenging
the overvalued construction costs of our newly constructed factory. Concurrently with RLSP s complaint, on March 25, 2024, Ningbo
Rongsen filed a counter-claim against RLSP with the Ningbo Fenghua District People s Court demanding RLSP to pay full construction
costs, overdue penalty, attorney fees and other costs totalling US 7,163,361 (RMB50,844,103.89) in accordance with the Settlement Payment
Agreement. The Ningbo Fenghua District People s Court accepted the above filings in connection with RLSP s complaint and
Ningbo Rongsen s counter-claim on May 9, 2024 and assigned a case number being (2024) Zhejiang 0213 Minchu No. 2289. Subsequently,
on July 26, 2024, the court ruled in favor of Ningbo Rongsen, ordering RLSP to pay full construction costs, overdue penalty, attorney
fees and other costs in accordance with the Settlement Payment Agreement. On August 9, 2024, RLSP appealed to the Ningbo Intermediate
People s Court, requesting the revocation of the civil court judgement in case number (2024) Zhejiang 0213 Minchu No. 2289. RLSP
seeks either a remand of the case for retrial or a revised judgement that supports its claims and rejects the counter-claim filed by
Ningbo Rongsen. 

In
May 2024, RLSP received a Notice of Legal Action from Taicang People s Court of China, with RLSP being the co-defendants under
a goods purchase contract dispute with case number (2024)SU0585 Minchu No. 3400. This lawsuit was initiated by Hecheng Special Rubber
(Taicang) Co., Ltd. Taicang Hecheng ), claiming that RSLP and Yongliansen, acting as co-buyers, have purchased EPDM rubber
from Taicang Hecheng since April 2023 but failed to pay purchase price for an aggregate amount of US 132,836.92 (RMB942,849.86). Taicang
Hecheng therefore filed a complaint against RSLP and Yongliansen for the outstanding purchase price and the late payment fee. 

Our
management maintains confidence in our legal standing and is actively pursuing a resolution that will be beneficial to us. As legal proceedings
are subject to inherent uncertainties, we cannot predict the outcome of this matter at the time of filing this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q.
