The business is included within the Plumbing Products segment. In connection with this acquisition, we recognized million of indefinite-lived intangible assets, which is related to trademarks, and million of definite-lived intangible assets, primarily related to customer relationships. The definite-lived intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted average amortization period of years. We also recognized million of goodwill, which is not tax deductible, and is related primarily to the expected synergies from combining the operations into our business. During the fourth quarter of 2023 and third quarter of 2024, we updated the allocation of the purchase price to certain identifiable assets and liabilities based on analysis of information as of the acquisition date, which resulted in a million decrease and a million increase to goodwill, respectively. 
 In the first quarter of 2021, our Hansgrohe SE subsidiary acquired a percent equity interest in Easy Sanitary Solutions B.V. ("ESS"). The remaining percent equity interest in ESS was subject to a call and put option that was exercisable by Hansgrohe SE or the sellers, respectively, any time after December 31, 2023. The redemption value of the call and put option was the same and based on a floating EBITDA value. The call and put options were determined to be embedded within the redeemable noncontrolling interest and were recorded as temporary equity in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. We elected to adjust the redeemable noncontrolling interest to its full redemption amount directly into retained deficit. 
 In the first quarter of 2024, the sellers exercised their put option to sell the remaining percent equity interest in ESS for million million). The transaction was accounted for as an equity purchase transaction.

 The 2022 Credit Agreement provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility available to us and one of our foreign subsidiaries in U.S. dollars, European euros, British pounds sterling and certain other currencies for revolving credit loans, swingline loans and letters of credit.

MASCO CORPORATION Item 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Overview 
 
 Due to changing market conditions, we are experiencing, and may continue to experience, lower market demand for our products. We have been experiencing, and may continue to experience, elevated commodity and other input costs, as well as employee-related cost inflation. We aim to offset the potential unfavorable impact of our costs and lower demand for our products with productivity improvements, pricing, and other initiatives. 
 We continue to execute our strategies of leveraging our strong brand portfolio, our industry-leading positions and the Masco Operating System, our methodology to drive growth and productivity, to create long-term shareholder value. We remain confident in the fundamentals of our business and long-term strategy. We believe that our strong financial position and cash flow generation, together with our investments in our industry-leading branded building products, our continued focus on innovation and customer service and disciplined capital allocation, will allow us to drive long-term growth and create value for our shareholders. 

THIRD QUARTER 2024 AND THE FIRST NINE MONTHS 2024 VERSUS THIRD QUARTER 2023 AND THE FIRST NINE MONTHS 2023 
 
 Consolidated Results of Operations 
 
 We report our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). However, we believe that certain non-GAAP performance measures and ratios used in managing the business may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior periods. Non-GAAP performance measures and ratios should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, our reported results under GAAP. Within the tables presented, certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers for disclosure purposes. 
 The following discussion of consolidated results of operations refers to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods of 2023. 
 
 NET SALES 
 
 Below is a summary of our net sales, in millions, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Net sales, as reported 1,983 1,979 6,000 6,085 (1) Acquisitions (13) (58) Divestitures (9) (9) Net sales, excluding acquisitions and divestitures 1,970 1,969 5,942 6,076 (2) Currency translation 6 24 Net sales, excluding acquisitions, divestitures and the effect of currency translation 1,976 1,969 5,966 6,076 (2) 
 16 

Our net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 1,983 million, which remained flat compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Excluding acquisitions, divestitures and the effect of currency translation, net sales remained flat primarily due to higher sales volume of plumbing products which increased sales by one percent, mostly offset by unfavorable sales mix of plumbing products which decreased sales by one percent. 
 Our net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 6,000 million, which decreased one percent compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Excluding acquisitions, divestitures and the effect of currency translation, net sales decreased two percent. Our net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased primarily due to lower sales volume across the entire company which decreased sales by two percent, lower net selling prices of decorative architectural products which decreased sales by one percent and unfavorable sales mix of plumbing products which decreased sales by one percent. These amounts were partially offset by higher net selling prices of plumbing products which increased sales by one percent. 
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Below is a summary of our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Favorable / (Unfavorable) 2024 2023 Favorable / (Unfavorable) Net sales

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 
 Our gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 725 million, which decreased three percent, and was negatively impacted by five percent due to the non-recurrence of the receipt of an insurance settlement payment in 2023, as well as higher commodity costs and unfavorable sales mix, partially offset by cost savings initiatives. 
 
 Our selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 368 million, which increased two percent, and were primarily impacted by higher marketing costs. 
 
 Our operating profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 357 million, which decreased seven percent, and was negatively impacted by decreased gross profit and higher selling, general and administrative expenses. 

17 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 
 Our gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2,195 million, which increased one percent, and was positively impacted by cost savings initiatives and one percent due to higher net selling prices. These amounts were partially offset by two percent due to the non-recurrence of the receipt of an insurance settlement payment in 2023, two percent due to lower sales volume, as well as unfavorable sales mix and one percent due to unfavorable foreign currency translation. 
 
 Our selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 1,123 million, which increased four percent, and were primarily impacted by higher employee-related costs. 
 
 Our operating profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1,073 million, which decreased three percent, and was negatively impacted by higher selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by increased gross profit.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS DISCUSSION 
 
 Plumbing Products 
 Sales 
 Net sales in the Plumbing Products segment increased two percent and one percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. In local currencies (including sales in currencies outside their respective functional currencies), net sales increased two percent and one percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, higher sales volume increased sales by two percent and the acquisition of Sauna360 Group Oy ("Sauna360") increased sales by one percent. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable sales mix which decreased sales by one percent. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, higher net selling prices and the acquisition of Sauna360 each increased sales by two percent. These increases were partially offset by lower sales volume and an unfavorable sales mix which each decreased sales by one percent. 
 Operating Results 
 Operating profit in the Plumbing Products segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was positively impacted by cost savings initiatives and higher sales volume, partially offset by higher commodity and transportation costs and unfavorable sales mix. Operating profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was positively impacted by cost savings initiatives and higher net selling prices, partially offset by unfavorable sales mix and increased employee-related costs. 
 Decorative Architectural Products 
 Sales 
 Net sales in the Decorative Architectural Products segment decreased three percent and five percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the decrease was due primarily to the divestiture of our Kichler business and lower sales volume of builders' hardware and lighting products. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the decrease was due primarily to lower sales volume and lower net selling prices across the segment. 
 Operating Results 
 Operating profit in the Decorative Architectural Products segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was negatively impacted by the non-recurrence of the receipt of an insurance settlement payment in 2023, higher marketing costs, and lower sales volume, partially offset by cost savings initiatives. Operating profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was negatively impacted by the non-recurrence of the receipt of an insurance settlement payment in 2023, lower net selling prices, and lower sales volume, partially offset by cost savings initiatives.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Overview of Capital Structure 
 We had cash and cash investments of approximately 646 million and 634 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Our cash and cash investments consist of overnight interest bearing money market demand accounts, time deposit accounts, and money market mutual funds containing government securities and treasury obligations. While we attempt to diversify these investments in a prudent manner to minimize risk, it is possible that future changes in the financial markets could affect the security or availability of these investments. Of the cash and cash investments we held at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 332 million and 323 million, respectively, was held in our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds were needed for our operations in the U.S., their repatriation into the U.S. would not result in significant additional U.S. income tax or foreign withholding tax, as we have recorded such taxes on substantially all undistributed foreign earnings, except for those that are legally restricted. 
 We believe that our present cash balance and cash flows from operations, and borrowing availability under our revolving credit agreement, are sufficient to fund our near-term working capital and other investment needs. We believe that our longer-term working capital and other general corporate requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from bank borrowings and future financial market activities. However, due to the changing market conditions and its impact on our customers and suppliers, we are unable to fully estimate the extent of the impact that the changing market conditions may have on our future financial condition. 
 Credit Agreement 
 On April 26, 2022, we entered into a revolving credit agreement (the 2022 Credit Agreement with an aggregate commitment of 1.0 billion and a maturity date of April 26, 2027. 
 Under the 2022 Credit Agreement, at our request and subject to certain conditions, we can increase the aggregate commitment up to an additional 500 million with the current lenders or new lenders. See Note I to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 22 

The 2022 Credit Agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain (A) a net leverage ratio, as adjusted for certain items, not exceeding 4.0 to 1.0, and (B) an interest coverage ratio, as adjusted for certain items, not less than 2.5 to 1.0. We were in compliance with all covenants and no borrowings were outstanding at September 30, 2024. 
 364-day Term Loan 
 On April 26, 2022, we entered into a 364-day 500 million senior unsecured delayed draw term loan (the "term loan") due April 26, 2023 with a syndicate of lenders. The term loan and commitments thereunder were subject to prepayment or termination at our option and the loans bore interest at SOFR plus a spread adjustment and 0.70 . The covenants, including the financial covenants, were substantially the same as those in the 2022 Credit Agreement. We repaid 300 million during 2022 and the remaining 200 million upon the maturity of the term loan on April 26, 2023. 
 Other Liquidity and Capital Resource Activities 
 On May 9, 2023, our Hansgrohe SE subsidiary entered into 70 million 77 million) of short-term borrowings to support working capital needs. The loans contained no financial covenants and 60 million 63 million) remained borrowed and outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 4.807 at September 30, 2023, and was fully repaid at December 31, 2023. 
 As part of our ongoing efforts to improve our cash flow and related liquidity, we work with suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions, including extending payment terms. We also facilitate a voluntary supply chain finance program (the "program") to provide certain of our suppliers with the opportunity to sell receivables due from us to participating financial institutions at the sole discretion of both the suppliers and the financial institutions. The amounts confirmed as valid under the program and included in accounts payable were 52 million and 53 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Of the amounts confirmed as valid under the program, the amounts owed to participating financial institutions were 28 million at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. All payments made under the program are recorded as a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, net, in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. A downgrade in our credit rating or changes in the financial markets could limit the financial institutions willingness to commit funds to, and participate in, the program. We do not believe such risk would have a material impact on our working capital or cash flows, as substantially all of our payments are made outside of the program. 
 Acquisitions 
 In the third quarter of 2023, we acquired all of the share capital of Sauna360 for approximately 124 million 136 million), net of cash acquired. Sauna360 has a portfolio of products that includes traditional, infrared, and wood-burning saunas as well as steam showers. 
 Divestitures 
 In the third quarter of 2024, we sold our Kichler business, a provider of decorative residential and light commercial lighting products, ceiling fans, and LED lighting systems, for preliminary consideration of 125 million, net of cash disposed, and subject to final closing adjustments. 
 Share Repurchases 
 Effective October 20, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase, for retirement, of up to 2.0 billion of shares of our common stock, exclusive of excise tax, in open-market transactions or otherwise. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased and retired approximately 6.6 million shares of our common stock (including 0.5 million shares to offset the dilutive impact of restricted stock units granted in the nine months ended September 30, 2024) for approximately 486 million, inclusive of excise tax of 3 million. At September 30, 2024, we had approximately 1.2 billion remaining under the 2022 authorization. Consistent with our past practice and as part of our long-term capital allocation strategy, outside of any potential acquisitions, we anticipate using approximately 750 million of cash for share repurchases in 2024. 

23 

Cash Flows 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operations was 668 million, primarily driven by operating profit, partially offset by changes in working capital. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used for financing activities was 673 million, primarily due to 482 million for the repurchase and retirement of our common stock, 191 million for the payment of cash dividends, 34 million for employee withholding taxes paid on stock-based compensation, 25 million for dividends paid to noncontrolling interest, and 15 million for the purchase of the remaining equity interest in Easy Sanitary Solutions B.V. These uses of cash were partially offset by 76 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by investing activities was 12 million, primarily driven by 131 million of proceeds from the sale of Kichler, net of cash disposed, partially offset by 112 million of capital expenditures.
