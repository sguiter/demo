Purchases were in the Company s sole discretion. In the case of repurchases made upon the death of a stockholder or qualifying disability Exceptional Repurchases ), as defined in the SRP, the one year holding period did not apply. The SRP has been amended several times. The currently effective version, entitled the Fifth Amended and Restated Share Repurchase Program (the Fifth SRP ), was adopted by the board of directors on November 7, 2023 and became effective on December 27, 2023. Under the Fifth SRP, the board of directors had the discretion to establish the proceeds available to fund repurchases each quarter and could use proceeds from all sources available to the Company, in the board of directors sole discretion. The board of directors also had the discretion to determine the amount of repurchases, if any, to be made each quarter based on its evaluation of the Company s business, cash needs and any other requirements of applicable law. The entirety of the Fifth SRP can be found on the Company s website. The SRP will immediately terminate if the Company s shares become listed for trading on a national securities exchange. In addition, the Company s board of directors, in its sole discretion, may, at any time, amend or terminate the SRP.

 retail operating leases. The remaining lease terms for the Company s leases range from less than to years. The Company considers the date on which it makes a leased space available to a lessee as the commencement date of the lease. At commencement, the Company determines the lease classification utilizing the classification tests under ASC 842. Options to extend a lease are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the tenant will exercise its option to extend. Termination penalties are included in income when there is a termination agreement, all the conditions of the agreement have been met and amounts due are considered collectable. Such termination fees are recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term in rental income. If an operating lease is modified and the modification is not accounted for as a separate contract, the Company accounts for the modification as if it were a termination of the existing lease and the creation of a new lease. The Company considers any prepaid or accrued rentals relating to the original lease as part of the lease payments for the modified lease. The Company includes options to modify the original lease term when it is reasonably certain that the tenant will exercise its option to extend. Most of the revenue from the Company s properties consists of rents received under long-term operating leases. Most leases require the tenant to pay fixed base rent paid monthly in advance, and to reimburse the Company for the tenant s pro rata share of certain operating expenses including real estate taxes, special assessments, insurance, utilities, common area maintenance, management fees, and certain building repairs paid by the Company and recoverable under the terms of the lease. Under these leases, the Company pays all expenses and is reimbursed by the tenant for the tenant s pro rata share of recoverable expenses paid.

For each property that is managed directly by the Real Estate Manager or its affiliates, the Company pays the Real Estate Manager a separate leasing fee. Further, in the event that the Company engages its Real Estate Manager to provide construction management services for a property, the Company pays a separate construction management fee. Leasing fees are included in deferred costs, net and construction management fees are included in building and other improvements in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company also reimburses the Real Estate Manager and its affiliates for property-level expenses that they pay or incur on the Company s behalf, including the salaries, bonuses and benefits of persons performing services for the Real Estate Manager and its affiliates except for the salaries, bonuses and benefits of persons who also serve as an executive officer of the Real Estate Manager or the Company. Real estate management fees and reimbursable expenses are included in property operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 

 (c) of its average invested assets. The fee was payable quarterly in an amount equal to of its average invested assets as of the last day of the immediately preceding quarter. Effective April 1, 2023, the Company began paying the Business Manager an annual business management fee equal to of its averaged invested assets. The fee is payable quarterly in an amount equal to of its average invested assets as of the last day of the immediately preceding quarter. Average invested assets means, for any period, the average of the aggregate book value of the Company s assets, including all intangibles and goodwill, invested, directly or indirectly, in equity interests in, and loans secured by, properties, as well as amounts invested in securities and consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures or other partnerships, before reserves for amortization and depreciation or bad debts, impairments or other similar non-cash reserves, computed by taking the average of these values at the end of each month during the relevant calendar quarter. Unpaid amounts are included in due to related parties on the consolidated balance sheets. The Business Management Agreement terminates on March 31, 2027. 

On January 19, 2024, the Company entered into the Fourth Business Management Agreement with the Business Manager effective February 1, 2024, to, among other things, provide the Company with the authority to engage a person not affiliated with or employed by the Business Manager to serve as president and chief executive officer of the Company and to reduce the business management fee payable to the Business Manager by the amount of any payment made to any third-party person as compensation for service as the Company s president and chief executive officer. In connection with the CEO Agreement entered into with Mr. Zalatoris, the Business Management Fee is reduced by the amount of any payments made to Mr. Zalatoris under the CEO Agreement.

The fair value of derivative instruments was estimated based on data observed in the forward yield curve which is widely observed in the marketplace. The Company also incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the counterparty's nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements which utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads. The Company has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its derivative interest rate swap agreements and therefore has classified these in Level 2 of the hierarchy.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis o f Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 Certain statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Words such as may, could, should, expect, intend, plan, goal, seek, anticipate, believe, estimate, predict, variables, potential, continue, expand, maintain, create, strategies, likely, will, would and variations of these terms and similar expressions, or the negative of these terms or similar expressions, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. 
 These forward-looking statements are not historical facts but reflect the intent, belief or current expectations of the management of Inland Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. (which we refer to herein as the Company, we, our or us based on their knowledge and understanding of the business and industry, the economy and other future conditions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and we caution stockholders not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors, including but not limited to the factors listed and described under Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 13, 2024, some of which are summarized below: 
 Our board is reviewing strategic alternatives, including sale of the Company. There is no assurance this review will result in a transaction or event creating liquidity for stockholders, or the value that may be generated by any transaction or event; 

During the pendency of our board s review of strategic alternatives, we do not expect to acquire new properties or engage in redevelopment activities which may negatively impact our ability to grow our assets and income; 

The use of the internet by consumers to shop continues to expand which could result in a further downturn in the businesses of certain of our current tenants in their brick and mortar locations and could affect their ability to pay rent and their demand for space at our retail properties; 

If our board does not pursue a sale of the Company, we may pursue redevelopment activities, which are subject to a number of risks, including, but not limited to: expending resources to determine the feasibility of the project or projects that are then not pursued or completed; construction delays or cost overruns; failure to meet anticipated occupancy or rent levels within the projected time frame, if at all; exposure to fluctuations in the general economy due to the significant time lag between commencing and completing the project; and reduced rental income during the period of time we are redeveloping an asset or assets; 

Our Business Manager and its affiliates face conflicts of interest caused by, among other things, their compensation arrangements with us, and the simultaneous overlapping leadership roles certain of our executive officers have at the Business Manager and its affiliates, which could result in actions that are not in the long-term best interests of our stockholders; 

Market disruptions resulting from any future disruptions from a global pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the Israeli-Hamas war, inflation, volatility in interest rates, supply chain shortages that affect our tenants or other disruptions caused by events beyond our control may adversely impact our results and financial condition, including our ability to service our debt obligations, borrow additional monies or pay distributions; 

We have incurred net losses on a GAAP basis for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and for the year ended December 31, 2023, and future net losses could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, operations, cash flow, and our ability to service our indebtedness or pay distributions to our stockholders; 

Our Sponsor may face a conflict of interest in allocating personnel and resources between its affiliates, our Business Manager and our Real Estate Manager; 

We do not have arm s-length agreements with our Business Manager, our Real Estate Manager or any other affiliates of our Sponsor; 

We pay fees, which may be significant, to our Business Manager, Real Estate Manager and other affiliates of our Sponsor; 

Our properties may compete with the properties owned by other programs sponsored by our Sponsor or Inland Private Capital Corporation for, among other things, tenants; 

Our Business Manager is under no obligation, and may not agree, to forgo or defer its business management fee; and 

If we fail to continue to qualify as a REIT, our operations and distributions to stockholders, if any, will be adversely affected. 

Forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q reflect our management s view only as of the date of this Quarterly Report, and may ultimately prove to be incorrect or false. We undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results except as required by 
 19 

applicable law. We intend for these forward-looking statements to be covered by the applicable safe harbor provisions created by Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. 
 The following discussion and analysis relates to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Our stockholders should read the following discussion and analysis along with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 We routinely post important information about us and our business, including financial and other information for investors, on our website. We encourage investors to visit our website at inland-investments.com/inland-income-trust from time to time, as information is updated and new information is posted. 
 Overview 
 We were formed as a Maryland corporation on August 24, 2011 and elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, commencing with the year ended December 31, 2013. We have no employees. We are managed by our business manager, IREIT Business Manager Advisor, Inc., referred to herein as our Business Manager. We have also entered into an agreement with Mark Zalatoris (the CEO Agreement to, among other things, compensate him for performing services as our president and chief executive officer. In connection with entering into the CEO Agreement, we entered into the Fourth Amended and Restated Business Management Agreement, dated January 19, 2024 Fourth Business Management Agreement with the Business Manager to, among other things, reduce the business management fee payable to the Business Manager by the amount of any payments made to Mr. Zalatoris under the CEO Agreement. Mr. Zalatoris is not an employee of the Company and is not an officer or director of the Business Manager but has the authority under the CEO Agreement and the Fourth Business Management Agreement to direct the day-to day operations of the Business Manager. 
 Historically, we have been operating pursuant to a strategic plan that included the goals of providing a future liquidity event to investors and creating long-term stockholder value. We have been primarily focused on acquiring and owning retail properties targeting a portfolio substantially all of which would be comprised of grocery-anchored properties. We have invested in joint ventures and, may invest again in additional joint ventures or acquire other real estate assets such as office and medical office buildings, multi-family properties and industrial/distribution and warehouse facilities if management believes the expected returns from those investments exceed that of retail properties. We also may invest in real estate-related equity securities of both publicly traded and private real estate companies, as well as commercial mortgage-backed securities. There were no acquisitions or dispositions in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The strategic plan has centered around owning a portfolio of grocery-anchored properties with lower exposure to big box retailers. Our management team has continually evaluated the opportunistic sale of certain assets with the goal of redeploying capital into the acquisition of strategically located grocery-anchored centers. We have not been actively marketing any properties for sale or seeking any acquisitions, however. We have also considered other transactions, such as redeveloping certain of our properties or portions of certain of our properties, for example, big-box spaces, to repurpose them for alternative uses. On September 18, 2024, we announced that our board had decided to begin a review of strategic alternatives including sale of the Company. There is no assurance as to how long the review will take or the outcome of the process. The outcome of any potential transaction or event will depend on several factors many of which will be beyond our control. Further, our board may conclude that it is in our best interest to continue operating pursuant to our existing strategic plan. During the pendency of this review, we do not expect to acquire any properties or redevelop existing properties although we may sell properties on an individual basis. We will continue to be impacted by: (i) evolving retail market conditions and other complex factors such as (ii) competition for our tenants from evolving internet businesses, (iii) the state of the commercial real estate market and financial markets, and (iv) changes in general economic conditions such as high interest rates, among other factors. 
 On March 4, 2024, our board of directors determined an estimated per share net asset value of our common stock of 19.17 as of December 31, 2023, compared to the previous estimated value of 19.86 as of December 31, 2022. As of September 30, 2024, we had total assets of 1.3 billion on our balance sheet and owned 52 properties located in 24 states containing 7.2 million square feet. A majority of our properties are multi-tenant, necessity-based retail shopping centers primarily located in major regional markets and growing secondary markets throughout the United States. As of September 30, 2024, grocery-anchored or grocery shadow-anchored shopping center properties represented 87 of our annualized base rent. A grocery shadow-anchored shopping center is a shopping center which we own that is located near a grocery store that we do not own but that we believe generates traffic for the shopping center. As of September 30, 2024, the portfolio properties have an economic occupancy of 93.6 and staggered lease maturity dates. Grocery tenants accounted for 17 of our annualized base rent ABR as of September 30, 2024. 
 20 

Inflation and Interest Rates 
 Inflationary pressures and volatility in interest rates could result in reductions in consumer spending and retailer profitability, particularly if rates rise which may impact our ability to increase rents as well as tenant demand for new and existing store locations. Regardless of high inflation levels, base rent under most of our long-term anchor leases remain constant (subject to tenants exercise of renewal options at pre-negotiated rent increases) until the expiration of their lease terms, regardless of the inflation rate for any particular period. While many of our leases require tenants to pay their share of shopping center operating expenses (including common area maintenance, real estate tax and insurance expenses), our ability to collect the expense increases passed through to tenants is dependent on their ability to absorb and pay these increases. Inflation may also impact other aspects of our operating costs, including fees paid to service providers, the cost to complete redevelopments and build-outs of recently leased vacancies and interest rate costs relating to variable rate loans and refinancing of lower fixed-rate indebtedness. While we have not been significantly impacted by any of these items to date, no assurances can be provided that these inflationary pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business in the future.

With respect to our locations affected by the Bed Bath and Beyond bankruptcy, we have executed a lease for three out of our four locations that closed and are in active lease negotiations with a national tenant to re-lease the last remaining space. 
 With respect to our locations affected by the Rite Aid bankruptcy, one of our two locations closed and that lease was rejected. We are currently working with a national retailer to backfill this location. Our other location is still open and operating and was not included on the closing list. This lease was assumed at the end of August 2024 and Rite Aid exited bankruptcy in early September 2024. 
 Lease Expirations 
 The following table sets forth a summary, as of September 30, 2024, of lease expirations scheduled to occur during the remainder of 2024 and each of the calendar years from 2025 to 2033 and thereafter, assuming no exercise of renewal options or early termination rights for leases commenced on or prior to September 30, 2024. Annualized base rent represents the rent in-place of the applicable property as of September 30, 2024. The table below includes ground leases. If ground leases are excluded, annualized base rent would equal 103,130 or 19.61 per square foot for total expiring leases.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 General 
 Our primary uses and sources of cash are as follows: 

Uses 
 
 Sources 

Interest and principal payments on mortgage loans and Credit Facility 

Cash receipts from our tenants 

Property operating expenses 

Sale of shares through the DRP 

General and administrative expenses 

Proceeds from new or refinanced mortgage loans 

Distributions to stockholders 

Borrowing on our Credit Facility 

Fees payable to our Business Manager and Real Estate Manager 

Proceeds from sales of real estate (if any) 

Repurchases of shares under the SRP 

Proceeds from issuance of securities (if any) other than through the DRP 

Capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing commissions 

Acquisitions of real estate directly or through joint ventures 

Redevelopments of entire properties or certain spaces within our properties 

Historically, we have generated capital through the issuance of shares of our common stock and by borrowing monies on either a secured or unsecured basis. Since completing our public offering in 2015, however, we have generated the bulk of our capital through borrowings. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 125 million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and 575 million outstanding under the Term Loan. As of September 30, 2024, the interest rates on the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan were 6.86 and 4.35 , respectively. As of September 30, 2023, the interest rates on the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan were 7.33 and 4.39 , respectively. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on February 3, 2026 subject to a twelve month extension, at the Company s option. The Term Loan matures on February 3, 2027. As of November 7, 2024, we had 75 million available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility, subject to the terms and conditions, including compliance with the covenants which could further limit the amount available, of the Credit Agreement that governs the Credit Facility. Although 75 million is the maximum available, covenant limitations affect what we can actually draw. As of November 7, 2024, approximately 40 million is available to draw as additional debt under the Revolving Credit Facility. By additional debt, we mean debt in addition to existing debt such as existing mortgages. The properties comprising the borrowing base for the Credit Facility are not available to be used as collateral for other debt unless removed from the borrowing base, which would shrink availability under the Credit Facility. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had total debt outstanding of 838 million, excluding unamortized debt issuance costs, which bore interest at a weighted average interest rate of 4.66 per annum. As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average years to maturity for our debt was 2.0 years. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our borrowings were 52 of the purchase price of our investment properties. As of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents balance was 10.9 million. 
 As of November 7, 2024, in the next twelve months, we have one mortgage loan maturing with an aggregate principal balance of 16.5 million, which we intend to repay with cash flows from operating activities, cash on hand or by drawing on the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased an aggregate of 5.0 million of shares of common stock. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we invested 10.1 million on capital expenditures and tenant improvements, which is approximately 3.0 million more than we did in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We expected to increase spending on tenant improvements in connection with new or renewed leases and capital expenditures in 2024 compared to 2023 but did not anticipate a material effect on our liquidity from this increase, assuming the businesses of our tenants, including those that were negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, remain steady or improve or they otherwise continue to pay their rent and fulfill their lease obligations. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have paid all interest and principal amounts when due, and were in compliance with all financial covenants under the Credit Facility as amended. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, distributions reinvested through the DRP were approximately 5.0 million. The SRP was funded by the proceeds from the DRP. 
 25 

On September 18, 2024, in connection with the process to review strategic alternatives, including the sale of the Company, the board of directors of the Company suspended both the DRP and the SRP effective as of October 1, 2024.

Operating activities 
 The increase in cash from operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to an increase in property net operating income primarily due to higher base rent, a decrease in cash paid for interest due to lower average debt outstanding and a decrease in business management fees in 2024 resulting from a change in the fee that became effective April 1, 2023.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, changes in total debt decreased 0.3 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to lower amounts of draws and repayments on the Credit Facility and mortgages payable in 2024 compared to 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated proceeds from the sale of shares pursuant to the DRP of 5.0 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, share repurchases were 5.0 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid 14.7 million in distributions. As noted herein, in connection with the board s review of strategic alternatives, the DRP and SRP have both been suspended.

Share Repurchases 
 Refer to Part II. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Use of Proceeds and Issuer Repurchases of Securities Share Repurchase Program for details regarding our SRP. The SRP was funded by the proceeds from the DRP. On September 18, 2024, in connection with the process to review strategic alternatives, including the sale of the Company, the board of directors of the Company suspended the SRP effective as of October 1, 2024. During the suspension, we will not repurchase shares under the SRP. Any existing unfulfilled repurchase requests will automatically roll over for processing under the terms and conditions of the SRP if we restart the plan, unless a stockholder withdraws the request for repurchase. Any prior redeemed shares will not be impacted. 
 Results of Operations 
 This section describes and compares our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Dollar amounts are stated in thousands. 
 We generate primarily all of our net operating income from property operations. All 52 investment properties we currently own were held for the entirety of both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Net operating income is a supplemental non-GAAP performance measure that we believe is useful to investors in measuring the operating performance of our property portfolio because our primary business is the ownership of real estate, and net operating income excludes various items included in GAAP net income that do not relate to, or are not indicative of, our property operating performance, such as depreciation and amortization and parent-level corporate expenses (including general and administrative expenses). 
 The following tables present the property net operating income prior to straight-line income (expense), net, amortization of intangibles, interest, and depreciation and amortization for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, along with a reconciliation to net loss, calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Net loss. Net loss was 3,207 and 3,710 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Total property net operating income. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, property net operating income increased 307, total property income increased 904, and total property operating expenses including real estate tax expense increased 597. 
 The increase in total property income is primarily due to an increase in base rent in new leases and step-up rent on existing leases and increased tenant recovery income due to an increase in recoverable expenses. The increase in property operating expenses is primarily due to an increase in repairs and maintenance expenses, increase in property management fees and an increase in insurance costs. 
 Straight-line income (expense), net. Straight-line income (expense), net decreased 90 in 2024 compared to 2023. The decrease is primarily due to step-up rent on existing leases in 2024. 
 Amortization of intangibles and lease incentives. Income from the amortization of intangibles and lease incentives increased 108 in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase is primarily due to lower write-offs in 2024. 
 General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased 164 in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase is primarily due to the amount paid to Mr. Zalatoris under the CEO Agreement and an increase in professional fees. 
 Business management fee. Business management fees decreased 70 in 2024 compared to 2023. The decrease is primarily due to the amount we pay Mr. Zalatoris under the CEO Agreement, which reduces our payment under the Business Management Agreement on a dollar-for-dollar basis. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, total costs incurred under the CEO Agreement were 88, which are included in general and administrative expenses. 
 Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased 75 in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase is primarily due to higher additions to fixed assets and leasing commissions during 2024 compared to 2023. 
 Interest expense. Interest expense decreased 325 in 2024 compared to 2023. The decrease is primarily due to lower average debt outstanding and a decrease in interest rate swap amortization. 
 Interest and other income. Interest and other income increased 22 in 2024 compared to 2023.

Net loss. Net loss was 9,748 and 11,274 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Total property net operating income. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, property net operating income increased 1,534, total property income increased 2,775, and total property operating expenses including real estate tax expense increased 1,241. 
 The increase in total property income is primarily due to an increase in base rent in new leases and step-up rent on existing leases, and an increase in tenant recovery income. The increase in property operating expenses is primarily due to an increase in snow removal costs, higher repairs and maintenance costs due to the timing of projects and an increase in insurance premium costs compared to 2023. 
 Straight-line income (expense), net. Straight-line income (expense), net increased 369 in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase is primarily due to lower straight-line write-offs in 2024 compared to 2023. 
 Amortization of intangibles and lease incentives. Income from the amortization of intangibles and lease incentives decreased 2,331 in 2024 compared to 2023. The decrease is primarily due to fully amortized intangibles and fewer write-offs for early terminations. 
 General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased 383 in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase is primarily due to the amount paid to Mr. Zalatoris under the CEO Agreement and an increase in professional fees. Amounts paid to Mr. Zalatoris reduce the amount paid by the Company to the Business Manager under the Business Management Agreement on a dollar-for-dollar basis. 
 Business management fee. Business management fees decreased 600 in 2024 compared to 2023. The decrease is primarily due to an amendment to the Business Management Agreement that reduced the base fee. As noted herein, the amount we pay Mr. Zalatoris under the CEO Agreement reduces our payment under the Business Management Agreement on a dollar-for-dollar basis. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total costs incurred under the CEO Agreement were 235, which are included in general and administrative expenses. 
 Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization decreased 912 in 2024 compared to 2023. The decrease is primarily due to a larger amount of fully amortized assets in 2024 compared to 2023. 
 Interest expense. Interest expense decreased 724 in 2024 compared to 2023. The decrease is primarily due to lower average debt outstanding and a decrease in interest rate swap amortization. 
 Interest and other income. Interest and other income increased 101 in 2024 compared to 2023.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP assumes the value of real estate assets is reduced over time due primarily to non-cash depreciation and amortization expense. Because real estate values may rise and fall with market conditions, operating results from real estate companies that use GAAP accounting may not present a complete view of their performance. We use Funds from Operations, or FFO , a widely accepted metric to evaluate our performance. FFO provides a supplemental measure to compare our performance and operations to other REITs. Due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT , has promulgated a standard known as FFO, which it believes more accurately reflects the operating performance of a REIT. On November 7, 2018, NAREIT s Executive Board approved the White Paper restatement, effective December 15, 2018. The purpose of the restatement was not to change the fundamental definition of FFO but to clarify existing guidance. The restated definition of FFO by NAREIT is net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of certain real estate assets, excluding impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate and excluding gains and losses from change in control. We have adopted the restated NAREIT definition for computing FFO. Previously presented periods were not impacted. 
 Under GAAP, acquisition related costs are treated differently if the acquisition is a business combination or an asset acquisition. An acquisition of a single property will likely be treated as an asset acquisition as opposed to a business combination and acquisition related costs will be capitalized rather than expensed when incurred. Publicly registered, non-listed REITs typically engage in a significant amount of acquisition activity in the early years of their operations, and thus incur significant acquisition related costs, during these initial years. Although other start up entities may engage in significant acquisition activity during their initial years, publicly registered, non-listed REITs are unique in that they typically have a limited timeframe during which they acquire a significant number of properties and thus incur significant acquisition related costs. Due to the above factors and other unique features of publicly registered, non-listed REITs, the Institute for Portfolio Alternatives, or IPA , an industry trade group, published a standardized measure known as Modified Funds from Operations, or MFFO , which the IPA has promulgated as a supplemental measure for publicly registered non-listed REITs and which may be another appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a non-listed REIT. We believe it is appropriate to use MFFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance because we believe that, when compared year-over-year, it reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income. 
 MFFO excludes expensed costs associated with investing activities, some of which are acquisition related costs that affect our operations only in periods in which properties are acquired, and other non-operating items that are included in FFO, such as straight-lining of rents as required by GAAP. By excluding costs that we consider more reflective of acquisition activities and other non-operating items, the use of MFFO provides another measure of our operating performance once our portfolio is stabilized. Because MFFO may be a recognized measure of operating performance within the non-listed REIT industry, MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate it may be useful in order to evaluate our performance against other non-listed REITs. Like FFO, MFFO is not equivalent to our net income or 
 30 

loss as determined under GAAP, as detailed in the table below, and MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance on value if we continue to acquire a significant amount of properties. MFFO should only be used as a measurement of our operating performance while we are acquiring a significant amount of properties because it excludes, among other things, acquisition costs incurred during the periods in which properties were acquired. 
 We believe our definition of MFFO, a non-GAAP measure, is consistent with the IPA s Guideline 2010-01, Supplemental Performance Measure for Publicly Registered, Non-Listed REITs: Modified Funds from Operations, or the Practice Guideline, issued by the IPA in November 2010. The Practice Guideline defines MFFO as FFO further adjusted for the following items, as applicable, included in the determination of GAAP net income: acquisition fees and expenses; amounts relating to straight-line rents and amortization of above and below market lease assets and liabilities, accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments; mark-to-market adjustments included in net income; nonrecurring gains or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis. 
 Our presentation of FFO and MFFO may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other REITs. We believe that the use of FFO and MFFO provides a more complete understanding of our operating performance to stockholders and to management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs. Neither FFO nor MFFO is intended to be an alternative to net income or to cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP as a measure of our capacity to pay distributions. Management uses FFO and MFFO to compare our operating performance to that of other REITs and to assess our operating performance. 
 Our FFO and MFFO for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are calculated as follows:

Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates and commodity prices. We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We have entered into, and may continue to enter into, financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in interest rates. The counterparties are, and are expected to continue to be, major financial institutions. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of long-term debt and the Revolving Credit Facility used to purchase properties or other real estate assets and to fund capital expenditures. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding debt of 837.8 million, excluding unamortized debt issuance costs, bearing interest rates ranging from 3.70 to 6.86 per annum. The weighted average interest rate was 4.66 , which includes the effect of interest rate swaps. As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average years to maturity for our mortgages and Credit Facility payable was 2.0 years. 
 31 

As of September 30, 2024, our fixed-rate debt consisted of secured mortgage financings with a carrying value of 111.8 million and a fair value of 108.3 million. Changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense incurred on our fixed-rate debt until their maturity or earlier repayment, but interest rates do affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt obligations. If market interest rates were to increase by 1 (100 basis points), the fair market value of our fixed-rate debt would decrease by 1.3 million as of September 30, 2024. If market interest rates were to decrease by 1 (100 basis points), the fair market value of our fixed-rate debt would increase by 1.3 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 175 million of debt or 21 of our total debt, excluding unamortized debt issuance costs, bearing interest at variable rates with a weighted average interest rate equal to 6.14 per annum. We had additional variable rate debt subject to swap agreements of 551 million, or 66 of our total debt, excluding unamortized debt issuance costs, as of September 30, 2024. 
 If interest rates on all debt which bears interest at variable rates as of September 30, 2024 increased by 1 (100 basis points), the increase in interest expense would decrease earnings and cash flows by 1.8 million annually. If interest rates on all debt which bears interest at variable rates as of September 30, 2024 decreased by 1 (100 basis points), the decrease in interest expense would increase earnings and cash flows by the same amount. 
 With regard to variable rate financing, our management assesses our interest rate cash flow risk by continually identifying and monitoring changes in interest rate exposures that may adversely impact expected future cash flows and by evaluating hedging opportunities. We utilize risk management control systems implemented by our Business Manager to monitor interest rate cash flow risk attributable to both of our outstanding or forecasted debt obligations as well as our potential offsetting hedge positions. 
 We use derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates on loans secured by our assets. Derivative instruments may include interest rate swap contracts, interest rate cap or floor contracts, futures or forward contracts, options or repurchase agreements. Our actual hedging decisions are determined in light of the facts and circumstances existing at the time of the hedge. We have used derivative financial instruments, specifically interest rate swap contracts, to hedge against interest rate fluctuations on variable rate debt, which exposes us to both credit risk and market risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. If the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty will owe us, which creates credit risk for us because the counterparty may not perform. Market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument that results from a change in interest rates. We seek to manage the market risk associated with interest-rate contracts by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken. There is no assurance we will be successful. 
 Derivatives 
 For information related to derivatives, reference is made to Note 6 Debt and Derivative Instruments which is included in our September 30, 2024 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management has evaluated, with the participation of our principal executive and principal financial officers, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the principal executive and principal financial officers have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) or Rule 15d-15(f)) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Part II - Other Information 
 Item 1. Lega l Proceedings 
 We are not a party to, and none of our properties are subject to, any material pending legal proceedings. 
 Item 1A. R isk Factors 
 The following risk factors amend and supplement the risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 32 

Our DRP has been suspended and thus is no longer a source of capital. 
 In connection with the board s review of strategic alternatives, we suspended the DRP. While we expect to continue paying distributions during the pendency of the review of strategic alternatives, because the DRP was suspended, it will no longer be a source of capital. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, distributions reinvested through the DRP generated capital of approximately 5.0 million. 
 Our SRP has been suspended and may be terminated in our Board s sole discretion. 
 In connection with the board s review of strategic alternatives, we suspended the SRP. During the suspension, we will not repurchase shares under the SRP. There is no assurance of when, or if, the suspension will be lifted if the review of strategic alternatives does not result in a transaction or event that results in a liquidity event for stockholders. 
 The outcome of the review of strategic alternatives is uncertain. 
 On September 18, 2024, we announced that our board had decided to begin a review of strategic alternatives, including sale of the Company. There is no assurance as to how long the review will take or the outcome of the process, including whether a transaction or event occurs at a price equal to or greater than our estimated per share NAV. The outcome of any potential transaction or event will depend on several factors many of which will be beyond our control. The process of reviewing strategic alternatives may be time consuming, distracting and disruptive to our business operations. In addition, given that reviewing strategic alternatives may result in a sale, merger or other strategic transaction, any perceived uncertainty regarding our future operations or needs may limit the ability of our business manager or real estate manager to retain or hire qualified personnel and may impact our ability to attract or retain tenants at our properties. Our board may conclude that it is in our best interest to continue with our existing business plan and not seek a transaction or event that would provide stockholders with liquidity. 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equ ity Securities, Use of Proceeds and Issuer Repurchases of Securities 
 Recent Sales of Unregistered Equity Securities 
 During the quarter covered by this report, we did not sell any equity securities that were not registered under the Securities Act. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 On September 18, 2024, in connection with beginning the process to review strategic alternatives, including the sale of the Company, the Company s board suspended the SRP effective as of October 1, 2024. During the suspension, we will not repurchase shares under the SRP. Any existing unfulfilled repurchase requests will automatically roll over for processing under the terms and conditions of the SRP if the suspension is lifted unless a stockholder withdraws the request for repurchase. Any prior redeemed shares will not be impacted. 
 The table below sets forth the number of shares we repurchased pursuant to our SRP during the three months ended September 30, 2024 (Dollar amounts in thousands except per share amounts):
