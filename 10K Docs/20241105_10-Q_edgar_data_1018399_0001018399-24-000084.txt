 At September 30, 2024, management performed its quarterly analysis of all securities with unrealized losses and determined that the losses were attributable to significant increases in market interest rates from March 2022 through July 2023. 
 
 Management concluded that no ACL for available-for-sale securities was necessary as of September 30, 2024 and anticipates they will mature or be called at par value. The Company does not intend to sell these investments and has determined, based upon available evidence, that it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell any such security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis.

Scheduled contractual maturities shown above may not reflect the actual maturities of the investments. The actual MBS/CMO cash flows likely will be faster than presented above due to prepayments and amortization. Similarly, included in the table above are callable securities, comprised of municipal securities and corporate bonds, with a fair value of million, which can be redeemed by the issuers prior to the maturity presented above. Management considers these factors when evaluating the interest-rate risk in the Company's asset-liability management program. 
 
 From time to time, the Company may pledge debt securities as collateral for deposit account balances of municipal customers, and for borrowing capacity with the FHLB and the FRB. The fair value of debt securities pledged as collateral for these purposes was million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 Loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty 
 
 The Company works with loan customers experiencing financial difficulty and may enter into loan modifications to the extent deemed to be necessary or appropriate while attempting to achieve the best mutual outcome given the individual financial circumstances and future prospects of the borrower. An assessment of whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty is made on the date of the modification. Modifications made for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty may be concessions in the form of principal forgiveness, interest rate reductions, payment deferrals of principal, interest or both, or term extensions, or some combination thereof. When a debt has been previously modified, the Company considers the cumulative effect of modifications made within the prior twelve-month period before the current modification, when determining whether or not a delay in payment resulting from the current modification is insignificant.

 Fair value hedges 
 
 Derivatives designated as fair value hedges are utilized to mitigate the risk of adverse interest-rate fluctuations on specifically identified assets or liabilities. The Company's fair value hedges are used to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of hedged items caused by changes in interest rates. 
 
 The Company had interest rate swap agreements with a combined notional value of million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Each interest rate swap agreement was designated as a fair value hedge and involves the net settlement of receiving floating-rate payments from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.

 Derivatives not subject to hedge accounting 
 
 Interest-rate Contracts 
 
 Each back-to-back interest-rate swap consists of interest-rate swaps (a customer swap and offsetting counterparty swap) and amounted to a total number of interest-rate swaps outstanding at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As a result of this offsetting relationship, there were net gains or losses recognized in income on back-to-back swaps during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or September 30, 2023. 
 
 Interest-rate swaps with counterparties are subject to master netting agreements, while interest-rate swaps with customers are not. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all back-to-back swaps with the counterparty were in asset positions, therefore there was no netting reflected in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the respective dates. 
 Risk Participation Agreements 
 
 The Company enters into RPAs for which the Company has assumed credit risk for customers' performance under interest-rate swap agreements related to the customers' commercial loan and receives fee income commensurate with the risk assumed. The RPAs and the customers' loan are secured by the same collateral. 
 
 Credit-risk-related Contingent Features 
 
 By using derivative financial instruments, the Company exposes itself to counterparty credit risk. Credit risk is the risk of failure by the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. The credit risk in derivative instruments is mitigated by entering into transactions with highly rated counterparties that management believes to be creditworthy. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had active interest-rate swap institutional counterparties both of which had investment grade credit ratings. 
 
 The Company's interest-rate swaps with counterparties contain credit-risk-related contingent provisions. These provisions provide the counterparty with the right to terminate its derivative positions and require the Company to settle its obligations under the agreements if the Company defaults on certain of its indebtedness. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had credit risk exposure relating to interest-rate swaps with counterparties of thousand and thousand, respectively and cash posted by counterparties amounted to thousand and thousand at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 The Company utilizes third-party pricing vendors to provide valuations on its debt securities. 
 
 The Company's equity portfolio fair value is measured based on quoted market prices for the shares; therefore, these securities are categorized as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. 
 
 The Bank is required to purchase FHLB stock at par value in association with advances from the FHLB. The stock is issued, redeemed, repurchased and transferred by the FHLB only at their fixed par value. This stock is classified as a restricted investment and carried at FHLB par value which management believes approximates fair value; therefore, these securities are categorized as Level 2 measures. 
 
 The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities, which are comprised of back-to-back swaps, fair value hedges and risk participation agreements, represent a FASB Level 2 measurement and are based on settlement values adjusted for credit risks and observable market interest-rate curves. The Company utilizes third-party vendors to provide valuations on its derivative assets and liabilities. Refer also to Note 8, "Derivatives and Hedging Activities," this Form 10-Q, contained above, for additional information on the Company's interest-rate swaps. 
 
 For loans individually assessed and deemed to be collateral dependent management has estimated the value and the probable credit loss by comparing the loan's amortized cost against the expected realizable fair value of the collateral (appraised value, or internal analysis, less estimated cost to sell, adjusted as necessary for changes in relevant valuation factors subsequent to the measurement date). Certain inputs used in these assessments, and possible subsequent adjustments, are not always observable,

 increases in market interest rates could negatively impact bond market values and result in a lower net book value; 
 our ability to successfully manage the current rising market interest-rate environment, our credit risk and the level of future non-performing assets and charge-offs; 
 potential decreases or growth of assets, deposits, future non-interest expenditures and non-interest income;

 Risk Management Framework 
 
 Management utilizes a comprehensive enterprise risk management framework that enables a coordinated and structured approach for identifying, assessing and managing risks across the Company and provides reasonable assurance that management has the tools, programs, people and processes in place to support informed decision making, anticipate risks before they materialize and maintain the Company's risk profile consistent with its strategic planning, and applicable laws and regulations. 
 
 See Part I, Item 1, "Business," under the "Risk Management Framework," of the Company's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional information on the Company's key risk mitigation strategies, and Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors," and Item 1C, "Cybersecurity," of the Company's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for numerous factors that could adversely affect the Company's future results of operations and financial condition, and its reputation and business model. 

Accounting Policies/Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 As discussed in the Company's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in this Form 10-Q, the most significant areas in which management applies critical assumptions and estimates are: the ACL for loans and available-for-sale securities, the reserve for unfunded commitments and the impairment review of goodwill. 
 
 The Company has not materially changed its significant accounting and reporting policies from those disclosed in the Company's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 See Note 1, Item (b), "Recent Accounting Pronouncements," to the Company's unaudited consolidated interim financial statements in this Form 10-Q for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements. 

Overview 
 
 Executive Summary 
 
 Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, amounted to 10.0 million, or 0.80 per diluted common share, compared to 9.7 million, or 0.79 per diluted common share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net income of 288 thousand was attributable primarily to an increase in non-interest income of 1.7 million, partially offset by an increase in non-interest expense of 1.0 million and a decrease in net interest income of 482 thousand. 
 
 Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, amounted to 28.0 million, or 2.26 per diluted common share, compared to 30.2 million, or 2.46 per diluted common share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net income of 2.1 million was attributable primarily to a decrease in net interest income of 7.2 million and an increase in non-interest expense of 5.3 million, partially offset by a decrease in the provision for credit losses of 4.7 million and an increase in non-interest income of 5.2 million. 
 
 Total assets amounted to 4.74 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to 4.47 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of 276.8 million, or 6 . The increase was due primarily to an increase in total loans of 291.3 million, or 8 , with growth primarily in commercial real estate and construction loans. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the non-performing loan to total loan ratio amounted to 0.67 compared to 0.32 at December 31, 2023. The increase in non-performing loans resulted primarily from two individually evaluated commercial construction loans which were placed on non-accrual in 2024. The ACL for loans to total loans ratio was 1.65 at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 Total deposits amounted to 4.19 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of 211.9 million, or 5 , compared to December 31, 2023, due primarily to increases in money market and certificate of deposit balances of 85.5 million and 153.6 million, respectively. 
 
 Shareholders' equity increased 39.0 million, or 12 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due primarily to an increase in retained earnings of 19.1 million and a decrease in the accumulated other comprehensive loss of 17.1 million.

 Results of Operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Unless otherwise indicated, the reported results in this subsection are for the three months ended September 30, 2024, with references to the "prior year period" and "comparable period" being the three months ended September 30, 2023. Average yields are presented on an annualized tax-equivalent basis (non-GAAP). 
 
 Net Income 
 Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, amounted to 10.0 million, an increase of 288 thousand, or 3 , compared to the prior year period. 
 
 Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income amounted to 38.0 million, a decrease of 482 thousand, or 1 , compared to the prior year period. The decrease was due primarily to increases in deposit interest expense of 7.7 million and borrowings interest expense of 646 thousand and a decrease in income on other interest-earning assets of 971 thousand, partially offset by an increase in loan interest income of 9.3 million. 
 
 The increase in interest expense during the period was attributed primarily to an increase in the cost of funds and changes in deposit mix, while the increase in interest income during the period was due primarily to loan growth and higher market interest rates. 
 
 Net Interest Margin 
 Net interest margin was 3.22 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.46 for the prior year period. 
 
 Net interest margin compared to the prior year period was impacted by the following factors: 
 Average other interest-earning assets decreased 79.0 million, or 30 , while the yield increased 20 basis points. 
 Average investment securities decreased 88.3 million, or 11 , and the tax-equivalent yield decreased 1 basis point. 
 Average total loans increased 441.0 million, or 13 , and the tax-equivalent yield increased 38 basis points. 
 Average total deposits increased 187.3 million, or 5 , and the yield increased 67 basis points. 
 Average borrowed funds increased 56.3 million, and the yield increased 208 basis points. 
 
 The decrease in net interest margin over the respective periods was due primarily to an increase in funding costs, partially offset by increases in loan and other interest-earning asset yields in addition to loan growth. Funding costs were impacted primarily by increases in market interest rates, increased competition for deposits and changes in deposit mix as depositors sought higher yielding money market and certificate of deposit products. Loan yields increased from loans originating and repricing at higher market rates.

 Provision for Credit Losses 
 The provision for credit losses for each of the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 are presented below: 
 Three months ended Increase / (Decrease) 
 (Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Provision for credit losses on loans - collectively evaluated 
 (663) (1,518) 855 Provision for credit losses on loans - individually evaluated 
 2,311 2,512 (201) Provision for credit losses on loans 1,648 994 654 Provision for unfunded commitments (316) 758 (1,074) Provision for credit losses 1,332 1,752 (420) 
 
 The provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was comprised of the following components: 
 A negative provision on loans collectively evaluated of 663 thousand resulting from a decrease in qualitative factors, partially offset by loan growth during the period. 
 A provision on individually evaluated loans of 2.3 million due primarily to the addition of one individually evaluated commercial relationship with specific reserves of 3.4 million, partially offset by a reduction of 1.2 million in specific reserves resulting from a commercial relationship that experienced improvement in its collateral valuation during the period. 
 A negative provision of 316 thousand due to a decrease in off-balance sheet commitments during the period. 
 
 The increase in the provision for credit losses on loans of 654 thousand was driven by an increase in the provision for credit losses on loans collectively evaluated of 855 thousand which was due to primarily a reduction of qualitative factors in the current year period which were of lesser magnitude that those in the prior year period. 
 
 The decrease in the provision for unfunded commitments for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period of 1.1 million was driven primarily by a decrease in off-balance sheet commitments during the period. 
 
 The ACL to total loans ratio was 1.65 at September 30, 2024 compared to 1.70 at September 30, 2023. 
 
 Non-Interest Income 
 Non-interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, amounted to 6.1 million, an increase of 1.7 million compared to the prior year period. The increase in non-interest income was due primarily to increases in gains on equity securities, wealth management fees and deposit and interchange fees. 
 
 Non-Interest Expense 
 Non-interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, amounted to 29.4 million, an increase of 1.0 million, or 4 , compared to the prior year period. The increase in non-interest expense was due primarily to an increase in salaries and employee benefits expense. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 25.9 , compared to 25.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, amounted to 109.4 million, a decrease of 7.2 million, or 6 , compared to the prior year period. The decrease was due largely to an increase in deposit interest expense of 28.5 million and decreases in interest and dividend income on investments of 2.5 million and other interest-earning assets income of 2.2 million, partially offset by an increase in loan interest income of 28.0 million. The increase in interest expense during the period was attributed primarily to an increase in the cost of funds and changes in deposit mix, while the increase in loan interest income during the period was due primarily to loan growth and higher market interest rates. 
 
 Net Interest Margin 
 Net interest margin was 3.20 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.59 for the prior year period. 
 
 Net interest margin compared to the prior year period was impacted by the following factors:

 Commercial real estate non owner-occupied loans increased 134.4 million, or 9 . 
 The composition of owner and non owner-occupied loans within the commercial real estate segment has remained relatively consistent compared to December 31, 2023. Commercial real estate loans collectively make up 58 of the total loan portfolio and were comprised of approximately 29 in owner-occupied loans and 71 in non owner-occupied loans. Growth since the prior period was primarily from continued customer demand and business development efforts. 
 Non owner-occupied commercial real estate loans were comprised of approximately 28 multi-family, 16 1-4 family, 11 office, and 12 retail. All other categories fell below 10 of total non owner-occupied commercial real estate loans. 
 Non owner-occupied commercial real estate loans secured by office buildings amounted to 5 of total loans and were located mainly in suburban areas and were modest in physical size. 
 Non owner-occupied commercial real estate loans secured by retail amounted to 5 of total loans and consisted primarily of local strip-mall plazas and not large shopping centers or mall complexes. 
 Commercial and industrial loans decreased 15.1 million, or 4 . 
 Commercial construction loans increased 89.3 million, or 15 , due to continued growth driven primarily by residential development projects to meet the strong demand for housing in our market area, partially offset by pay downs, payoffs, and transfer of construction loans to the permanent commercial real estate segments. 
 The composition of the commercial construction segment has remained relatively consistent compared to December 31, 2023. 
 Commercial construction loans were comprised of approximately 28 multi-family, 18 residential condominiums, 13 land approved for development and 13 single residential lots. All other collateral categories each fell below 10 of total commercial construction loans. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, commercial loan balances participated out to various banks amounted to 76.1 million, compared to 69.8 million at December 31, 2023. These commercial loan balances participated out to other institutions are not carried as assets on the Company's financial statements. Commercial loans originated by other banks in which the Company is a participating institution are carried at the pro-rata share of ownership and amounted to 157.5 million and 126.6 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 Asset Quality 
 
 The following table sets forth information regarding the Company's loan portfolio asset quality as of the dates indicated: 
 (Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Non-performing loan summary: 
 Commercial real estate owner-occupied 2,489 2,683 Commercial real estate non owner-occupied 2,776 2,686 Commercial and industrial 3,851 4,262 Commercial construction 14,773 Residential mortgages 1,796 1,526 Home equity 261 257 Consumer Total non-performing loans 
 25,946 11,414 Total adversely classified loans 54,824 56,650 Total loans 3,858,940 3,567,631 Adversely classified loans to total loans 
 1.42 1.59 Loans 60-89 days past due and still accruing to total loans 0.02 Non-performing loans to total loans 0.67 0.32 Non-performing assets to total assets 0.55 0.26 Allowance for credit losses for loans 63,654 58,995 Allowance for credit losses for loans to non-performing loans 245.33 516.87 Allowance for credit losses for loans to total loans 1.65 1.65 
 
 Non-performing loans that were not adversely classified amounted to 27 thousand and 30 thousand at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and represented the guaranteed portion of SBA loans. 
 
 The increase in non-performing loans from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 was attributable primarily to two individually evaluated commercial construction loans, which were placed on non-accrual in the first and third quarters of 2024. 
 The commercial construction loan that was placed on non-accrual during the first quarter of 2024 was secured by a multi-family property, had an outstanding balance of 7.9 million and a specific reserve of 1.3 million at September 30, 2024. Due to the on-going construction and improvement in the valuation of the collateral property, specific reserves were decreased by 1.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The commercial construction loan that was placed on non-accrual during the third quarter of 2024 was a participation loan originated by another local institution secured by a lab and office space building. The loan had an outstanding balance of 6.9 million and a specific reserve of 3.4 million at September 30, 2024. The company had no other significant exposure to loans secured by lab space at September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Company had no OREO at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and therefore non-performing loans were the only component of non-performing assets. 
 
 ACL for Loans 
 
 There have been no material changes to the Company's ACL for loans methodology, underwriting practices, or credit risk management system used to estimate credit loss exposure as described in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 The estimate of credit loss incorporates management judgements and assumptions including the estimated life of the loans, adjustments for current conditions and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts. Management periodically reviews and updates its assumptions based on changing circumstances.

 ACL for loans activity 
 
 The following table summarizes the activity in the ACL for loans for the periods indicated: 
 Nine months ended September 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Balance at beginning of year 58,995 52,640 Provision for credit losses for loans 4,644 5,355 Recoveries of charged-off loans:

 (15) 90 Ending balance 63,654 57,905 Annualized net loans (recovered) charged-off to average loans outstanding 

Reserve for unfunded commitments 
 
 The reserve for unfunded commitments is classified within "Other liabilities" on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The estimate of credit loss incorporates the same loss factors as on-balance sheet loans with added assumptions for both the likelihood and amount of funding over the estimated life of non-cancellable commitments. 
 
 The Company's reserve for unfunded commitments amounted to 4.6 million as of September 30, 2024 and 7.1 million at December 31, 2023. The decreases in the reserve for unfunded commitments resulted primarily from a decrease in the Company's off-balance sheet commercial construction commitments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Based on the foregoing, management believes that the Company's ACL for loans and reserve for unfunded commitments is adequate as of September 30, 2024. 

Deposits 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, total deposits amounted to 4.19 billion, an increase of 211.9 million, or 5 , since December 31, 2023. The increase was driven primarily by increases in money market account balances of 85.5 million, or 6 , and CD account balances of 153.6 million, or 29 , as customers sought higher yielding deposit products.

Table of Contents 

 The following table sets forth the deposit balances by certain categories and the percentage of each category to total deposits as of the dates indicated: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (Dollars in thousands) Amount Percent Amount Percent Checking 1,746,474 42 1,758,641 44 Money markets and savings 1,768,261 42 1,697,804 43 CDs 674,726 16 521,076 13 Deposits 4,189,461 100 3,977,521 100 
 
 Total customer deposits include reciprocal balances from checking, money market deposits and CDs received from participating banks in nationwide deposit networks as a result of our customers electing to participate in Company offered programs which allow for third-party enhanced FDIC deposit insurance. Under this enhanced FDIC deposit insurance program, the equivalent of the customers' original deposited funds are reciprocated back through the network to the Company and are carried within the appropriate category under deposits. The Company's balances in these reciprocal enhanced FDIC deposit insurance products were 875.3 million and 835.0 million, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The increase in balance reflects primarily an increase in customer demand for enhanced FDIC deposit insurance products. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, uninsured deposits amounted to 34 of total deposits. Additional capacity to utilize enhanced FDIC deposit insurance products noted in the preceding paragraph exceeds the Company's total deposits balance at September 30, 2024. 

Borrowed Funds 
 
 The Company had borrowed funds outstanding of 59.9 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 25.8 million at December 31, 2023. Borrowed funds at September 30, 2024 were primarily comprised of advances from the FRB's BTFP totaling 51.4 million. The remaining balance consisted of term advances related to specific lending projects funded under community development programs through the FHLB and NH BFA. 
 
 See also "Liquidity," below, for additional information on borrowing capacity. 
 
 Shareholders' Equity 
 
 Total shareholders' equity amounted to 368.1 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 329.1 million at December 31, 2023, an increase of 39.0 million, or 12 . The increase was due primarily to an increase in retained earnings of 19.1 million, and a decrease in the accumulated other comprehensive loss of 17.1 million. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company declared cash dividends of 8.9 million and shareholders utilized the dividend reinvestment portion of the Company's dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan to purchase aggregate shares of the Company's common stock amounting to 44,459 shares totaling 1.2 million. 
 
 On October 15, 2024, the Company announced a quarterly dividend of 0.24 per share to be paid on December 2, 2024 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 11, 2024. 

Derivatives and Hedging 
 
 Derivatives designated as hedging instruments 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had three pay fixed, receive float, interest rate swap agreements with a cumulative notional value of 100.0 million, of which 50.0 million matures in June 2025 and the other 50.0 million matures in September of 2025. Under these interest rate swap agreements, the Company pays a weighted average fixed interest rate of 4.68 and receives SOFR. At September 30, 2024 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of these interest rate swap agreements, which were carried on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets, represented liabilities of 702 thousand and 760 thousand, respectively. 
 
 Derivatives not subject to hedge accounting 
 
 The notional value of back-to-back interest-rate swaps with customers and counterparties amounted to 7.3 million at 
 
 50 

Table of Contents 

 September 30, 2024 compared to 7.5 million at December 31, 2023. The fair value of assets and corresponding liabilities associated with these swaps and carried on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets was 481 thousand at September 30, 2024 compared to 630 thousand at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Risk Participation Agreements 
 
 The notional value of RPAs sold amounted to 46.5 million at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The fair value of RPAs, carried on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as a liability, was 55 thousand at September 30, 2024 compared to 65 thousand at December 31, 2023. 

Liquidity 
 
 Liquidity is the ability to meet cash needs arising from, among other things, fluctuations in loans, investments, deposits and borrowings. Liquidity management is the coordination of activities so that cash needs are anticipated and met readily and efficiently. The Company's liquidity is maintained by projecting cash needs, balancing maturing assets with maturing liabilities, monitoring various liquidity ratios, monitoring deposit flows, maintaining cash flow within the investment portfolio, and maintaining wholesale funding resources. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the Bank had the capacity to borrow additional funds from the FHLB and FRB of up to approximately 840.0 million and 300.0 million, respectively. 
 
 Management believes that the Company has adequate liquidity to meet its obligations. However, if general economic conditions, potential recession in the U.S. and our market areas, uncertainty in the banking industry, changes in interest rates, increased competition for deposits and related changes in deposit customers behavior, or other events, cause these sources of external funding to become restricted or are eliminated, the Company may not be able to raise adequate funds or may incur substantially higher funding costs or operating restrictions in order to raise the necessary funds to support the Company's operations and growth. 

Capital Resources 
 
 The principal cash requirement of the Company is the payment of interest on subordinated debt and the payment of dividends on our common stock. The Company's Board of Directors may approve cash dividends on a quarterly basis after careful analysis and consideration of various factors, including our capital position, economic conditions, growth rates, earnings performance and projections as well as strategic initiatives and related regulatory capital requirements. 
 
 The Company's primary source of cash is dividends paid by the Bank, which are limited to the Bank's net income for the current year plus its retained net income for the prior two years. 
 
 The Company's total capital and tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets amounted to 13.07 and 10.36 , respectively, at September 30, 2024, compared to 13.12 and 10.34 , respectively, at December 31, 2023. Tier 1 capital to average assets amounted to 8.68 at September 30, 2024, compared to 8.74 at December 31, 2023. 

Wealth Management 
 
 Wealth assets under management and wealth assets under administration are not carried as assets on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company provides a wide range of wealth management and wealth services, including investment management, trust and trustee services, brokerage, annuities and 401(k) administration. 
 
 Wealth assets under management and wealth assets under administration amounted to 1.21 billion and 302.9 million, respectively, at September 30, 2024, representing increases of 134.3 million, or 12 , and 60.6 million, or 25 , respectively, compared to December 31, 2023. The increase in assets under management and administration resulted primarily from an increase in market values.

 Item 3 - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Interest Margin Sensitivity Analysis 
 
 Refer to Part II, Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" of the Company's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the Company's net interest income and net interest margin sensitivity under different interest rate and yield curve scenarios as well as different asset and liability mix scenarios. 
 
 The tables below summarize the simulated results at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and compare the percentage change in net interest income for each interest rate scenario to the rates unchanged scenario. The results in the tables below assume a static balance sheet and the net interest income results are for a 24-month period. Table 1 assumes all interest rates are ramped evenly over 12 months. Table 2 differs from table 1 by simulating that interest rate changes for non-maturity deposits are ramped evenly over 24 months instead of 12 months. 
 
 Table 1 - Interest Rate Changes All rates ramped over 12 months 
 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Scenarios 
 Percentage Change Percentage Change Rates rise 400 basis points (14.08) (11.71) Rates rise 200 basis points 
 (6.79) (5.71) Rates unchanged 
 Rates decline 200 basis points 
 4.88 3.26 
 
 Table 2 - Interest Rate Changes All rates ramped over 12 months, 
 except for non-maturity deposits which are ramped over 24 months 
 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Scenarios 
 Percentage Change Percentage Change Rates rise 400 basis points (5.48) (3.11) Rates rise 200 basis points 
 (2.64) (1.60) Rates unchanged 
 Rates decline 200 basis points 
 0.92 (0.54) 
 
 The change in results at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 were impacted primarily by an increase in interest bearing liabilities. Over the 24-month period, the net result was lower estimated net interest income in increased interest rate scenarios and higher estimated net interest income in decreased interest rate scenarios. 
 
 The results in the tables above are subject to various assumptions as reported in Part II, Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" of the Company's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Refer to heading "Results of Operations" contained within Item 2, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Form 10-Q for further discussion of margin. 

Item 4 - Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in reports that it files or furnishes to the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. 
 
 The Company carried out an evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act 
 
 52 

Table of Contents 

 Rule 13a-15(b). Based upon that evaluation, the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no significant changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company's most recent fiscal quarter (i.e., the three months ended September 30, 2024) that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1 - Legal Proceedings 
 
 There are no material pending legal proceedings to which the Company or its subsidiaries are a party or to which any of its property is subject, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business of the Company. Management does not believe resolution of any present litigation will have a material adverse effect on the business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations of the Company. 

Item 1A - Risk Factors 
 
 Management believes that there have been no material changes in the Company's risk factors as reported in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors," of the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks described in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and our subsequent quarterly reports are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.
