reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding common shares. Accordingly, all common share, stock option, per common share and warrant amounts for all periods presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been adjusted retrospectively to reflect this reverse stock split. 
 
 Liquidity and Going Concern Assessment 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the Company reported a net loss of million and million, respectively, and negative cash from operations of million and a cash inflow million, respectively, including non-recurring proceeds of million from the leasing and sale of the building during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million, current liabilities of million and an accumulated deficit of million. The Company's current liabilities of million include the note payable with Summit Investment Services, LLC in the amount of approximately million due on February 1, 2025 as disclosed in Note 10. The Company has not generated revenues from commercial operations and expects to continue incurring losses for the foreseeable future. 
 
 Management believes that the Company does not have sufficient capital resources to sustain operations through at least the next twelve months from the date of this filing. Additionally, in view of the Company s expectation to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future it will be required to raise additional capital resources in order to fund its operations, although the availability of, and the Company s access to such resources, is not assured. Accordingly, management believes that there is substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue operating as a going concern through the next twelve months from the date of this filing. 
 
 The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the assumption the Company will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts of liabilities that may result from uncertainty related to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 Reclassification of Prior Period Financial Statements 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , the gain on disposal of property, plant and equipment was presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations within loss from operations. This reclassification was made for the year ended December 31, 2023 and presented in the Annual Report on Form 10 -K for the year then ended.

 General 
 
 Aqua Metals is engaged in the business of applying its commercialized clean, water-based, recycling technology principles to develop cost-efficient recycling solutions for both lead and lithium-ion Li batteries. Our recycling process is a patented hydro and electrometallurgical technology that is an innovative, proprietary and patented process we developed and named AquaRefining. AquaRefining is a low-emissions, closed-loop recycling technology that has the potential to replace polluting furnaces and hazardous chemicals with electricity-powered electroplating to recover valuable metals and materials from spent batteries with higher purity, lower emissions, and with minimal waste. The modular Aqualyzers cleanly generate ultra-pure metal one atom at a time, closing the sustainability loop for the rapidly growing energy storage economy. 
 
 This breakthrough technology was initially applied in the lead acid battery (LAB) recycling industry, building the first integrated recycling system for breaking LAB and recovering pure metal. In 2019, we operated our demonstration AquaRefinery at commercial quantity production levels and produced over 35,000 AquaRefined ingots operating twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week for sustained periods of time. 
 
 We are also applying our commercialized clean, water-based recycling technology principles with the goal of developing the cleanest and most cost-efficient recycling solution for lithium-ion batteries. We believe our process has the potential to produce higher quality products at a lower operating cost without the damaging effects of furnaces and greenhouse emissions. 
 
 In February 2021, we announced our entry into the lithium-ion battery (LiB) recycling market through a key provisional patent we filed that applies the same innovative AquaRefining approach. In August 2021, we announced we had established our Innovation Center in TRIC focused on applying our proven technology to LiB recycling research and development and prototyping. Our strategic decision to apply our proven clean, closed-loop hydrometallurgical and electrochemical recycling experience to lithium-ion battery recycling is designed to meet the growing demand for critical metals driven by the global transition to electric vehicles; growth in internet data centers; and alternative energy applications including solar, wind, and grid-scale storage. 
 
 During the first half of 2022, we announced our ability to recover copper, lithium hydroxide, nickel, and cobalt from lithium-ion battery black mass at bench scale at the Company s Innovation Center. During 2022, we built our fully-integrated pilot system, located within the Company s Innovation Center, which is designed to allow Aqua Metals to be the first company in North America to recycle battery minerals from black mass, sell them in the U.S. and position the Company as the first LiB recycler in North America to align with the U.S. government s goal of retaining strategic battery minerals within the domestic supply chain. 
 
 During 2022, we conducted environmental comparisons based on Argonne National Lab s modeling of lithium battery supply chains called EverBatt. The initial results indicate that AquaRefining is a cleaner approach to LiB recycling, producing far less CO2 waste streams than smelting or chemical-driven hydrometallurgical processes currently on the market. In December 2022, we completed equipment installation and began to operate our first-of-a-kind LiB recycling facility, utilizing electricity as the catalyst to recycle instead of intensive chemical processes, fossil fuels, or high-temperature furnaces. In January 2023, Aqua Metals recovered its first metals from recycling lithium batteries using the patent-pending Li AquaRefining process.

In February 2023, we acquired a five-acre recycling campus at the TRIC. When fully developed, the facility we design will process up to 10,000 tonnes of lithium-ion battery material each year using our proprietary Li AquaRefining technology. Subject to our receipt of the required additional capital, we expect to complete development of phase one. The Company is planning for a phased development of the campus, beginning with the already commenced redevelopment of an existing building on-site into the first commercial-scale Li AquaRefinery, targeting 3,000 tons per annum (tpa) capacity in phase one. In the first half of 2024, we made significant progress on the construction of the planned first phase of the commercial Li AquaRefinery and we continue to pursue the required funding for the completion of the phase one development of our five acre recycling campus through various sources, including debt, project finance, joint venture and strategic investment options. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we issued 306,049 shares of common stock pursuant to an at the market issuance sales agreement ("ATM") for net proceeds of 2.8 million. On May 14, 2024, we completed a public offering of 1,006,250 shares of our common stock, at the public offering price of 7.80 per share. In connection with the sale of common stock, the Company issued warrants to purchase shares of common stock at the rate of one warrant for every share of purchased common stock, at the price of 0.20 per share. After the deduction of the underwriter s discount and expenses payable by us, we received net proceeds of 7.3 million. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we issued 162,215 shares of common stock pursuant to an at the market issuance sales agreement for net proceeds of 3.8 million. We raised a net of 18.3 million in the third quarter of 2023 from the public offering of our common shares and a net of 4.6 million from the sale of our common stock to Yulho. 
 
 Our current focus is building and operating our first-of-a-kind lithium battery recycling facility, utilizing electricity to recycle instead of intensive chemical processes, fossil fuels, or high-temperature furnaces. We are also pursuing potential partnership and/or joint ventures agreements and licensing agreements, particularly as our Li AquaRefining continues to develop and improve. We believe that Aqua Metals is in a position to become one of the few critical minerals recovery players for which our environmental and economic value proposition should generate both great commercial wins and potentially government grants to accelerate our credibility and progress. 
 
 Plan of Operations 
 
 Our business strategy is based on the pursuit of building, operating and licensing Li AquaRefining recycling capacity to meet the growing demand for critical metals in lithium-ion batteries driven by innovations in automobile batteries, growth in internet data centers, and alternative energy applications, including solar, wind, and grid-scale storage. 
 
 We are in the process of demonstrating that Li AquaRefining, which is fundamentally non-polluting, can create the highest quality and highest yields of recovered minerals from lithium-ion batteries with lower waste streams and lower costs than existing alternatives. We have already demonstrated at our pilot facility our ability to recover key valuable minerals in lithium-ion batteries, such as lithium hydroxide, copper, nickel, cobalt, and other compounds. Our goal is to recycle commercial quantities of nickel, cobalt, and copper in a pure metal form that can be sold to the general metals and superalloy markets and can be made into battery precursor compound materials with known processes already used in the mining industry. We also intend to recycle commercial amounts of lithium that can be sold to lithium-ion battery manufacturers. We have installed, commissioned, and operated our pilot plant since December of 2022. During the first half of 2024 we have been building a commercial demonstration plant operation with capacity of processing approximately 3,000 tonnes of black mass per year. The location for the pilot demonstration is currently the Innovation Center with the commercial demonstration plant to be constructed at our 5-acre recycling campus starting with processing ~3,000 tonnes of black mass per year and growing to commercial quantities of ~10,000 tonnes per year or more of production. Equipment installation and construction at the demonstration plant is currently paused. These activities will resume once the company obtains funding. The remaining construction and installation are expected to take approximately 6 months from the date of funding.

Plant operations include materials, supplies related costs, salaries and benefits, consulting, outside services costs, inventory adjustments, depreciation, amortization, insurance, travel and overhead costs. Plant operations decreased approximately 153,000 or 8.6 and increased 1,882,000, or 43.6 , for the for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in plant operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in payroll and payroll related fees of approximately 189,000, as we completed a reduction of force during August 2024. Management does not expect the reduction in force to materially impact its current pilot operations or continuing research and development. However, during the fourth quarter 2024 and until funding is received, we expect reduced employee and overhead expense. The severance and other non-recurring expenses related to the reduction in force were not material. The increase in plant operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to an increase in payroll and payroll related fees of approximately 1,283,000, as we hired additional staff and we engaged our lab and engineering staff in operating the pilot facility and processing black mass, as well as 261,000 in supplies and materials, 167,000 increase in insurance expenses and 129,000 in professional fees. These increases occurred prior to the workforce reduction in August 2024. 
 
 Research and development cost includes expenditures related to the improvement of the AquaRefining technology and the development of our lithium-ion battery recycling process. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, research and development costs increased 9,000, or approximately 2.3 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, research and developments costs decreased 10,000, or approximately 0.7 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 We recognized a loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment of 448,000 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a gain of 23,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the loss on property, plant and equipment resulted from the sale of fixed assets. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the gain on property, plant and equipment resulted from the sales of fixed assets. 
 
 General and administrative expense decreased 67,000, or approximately 2.4 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 and an increase 500,000, or approximately 5.8 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by the write off of the debt issuance costs of 563,000, previously representing a deferred asset.

The decrease in interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is due to the reduction on the note payable outstanding balance. 
 
 We recognized approximately 84,000 and 329,000 in interest and other income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, a decrease of 405,000 and 574,000 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease in interest and other income is primarily due to the decrease in miscellaneous income from the non-recurring engineering agreement with 6K Energy.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had total assets of 28.5 million. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 3.0 million, current liabilities of 7.1 million and a working capital deficit of 2.9 million. The Company's current liabilities of 7.1 million include the note payable with Summit Investment Services, LLC in the amount of approximately 3 million due on February 1, 2025 as disclosed in Note 10. The Company has not generated revenues from commercial operations and expects to continue incurring losses for the foreseeable future. In order to satisfy our capital requirements, the Company will need to improve its liquidity position through equity or debt financings and/or reductions in operating costs, in order to satisfy its liquidity needs for the next twelve months. Management is devoting significant efforts to increasing liquidity, raising capital and developing its business. 
 
 Management believes that the Company does not have sufficient capital resources to sustain operations through at least the next twelve months from the date of this filing. Additionally, in view of the Company s expectation to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and its current working capital deficit, it will be required to raise additional capital resources in order to fund its operations, although the availability of, and the Company s access to such resources, is not assured. Accordingly, management believes that there is substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue operating as a going concern through the next twelve months from the date of this filing.

Item 1A. 
 Risk Factors 

Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 includes certain risk factors that could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. There have been no material changes to those risk factors, except as described below: 
 
 We will need additional financing to execute our business plan and fund operations, which additional financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all . As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 3.0 million, current liabilities of 7.1 million and a working capital deficit of 2.9 million. As of the date of this report, we believe that we will require additional capital in order to fund our current level of ongoing costs and our proposed business plan over the next 12 months as we move forward with our business strategy. We intend to acquire the necessary capital though debt financing or through the sale of equity. Funding that includes the sale of our equity may be dilutive. If such funding is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to further pursue our business plan and we may be unable to continue operations, in which case you may lose your entire investment. In addition, our current liabilities of 7.1 million include the note payable with Summit Investment Services, LLC in the amount of approximately 3 million due on February 1, 2025 as disclosed in Note 10. The Summit Investment note is secured by a first priority lien on our facility and site improvements located at our TRIC recycling facility. In the event of our inability to repay or refinance the Summit Investment note, the lender could commence foreclosure action against our recycling facility. 
 
 The report of our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2023 states that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued.
