Forward looking statements are generally identified by the words "estimates," "expects," "anticipates," "projects," "plans," "intends," "believes," "forecasts," "looks," and future or conditional verbs, such as "will," "should," "could" or "may," as well as variations of such words or similar expressions. All forward-looking statements are based upon our current expectations and various assumptions and apply only as of the date of this Report. Our expectations, beliefs and projections are expressed in good faith and we believe there is a reasonable basis for them. However, there can be no assurance that our expectations, beliefs and projections will be achieved. 
 
 There are a number of risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those suggested by our forward-looking statements, including those set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 under Item 1A "Risk Factors," in Part II, Item 1A of this Report, and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

 locations in North America as of September 30, 2024. The Company conducts substantially all of its operations through subsidiaries, including Herc Rentals Inc. ("Herc").

 and of total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to and for the same periods in 2023. 
 The Company s rental transactions are accounted for under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 842, Leases ("Topic 842"). The Company s sale of rental and new equipment, parts and supplies along with certain services provided to customers are accounted for under ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("Topic 606"). The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for such products or services.

 Topic 842 revenues 
 Equipment Rental Revenue 
 The Company offers a broad portfolio of equipment for rent on daily, weekly or monthly basis, with substantially all rental agreements cancellable upon the return of the equipment. Virtually all customer contracts can be canceled by the customer with no penalty by returning the equipment within ; therefore, the Company does not allocate the transaction price between the different contract elements. 
 Equipment rental revenue includes revenue generated from renting equipment to customers and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the length of the rental contract. As part of this straight-line methodology, when the equipment is returned, the Company recognizes as incremental revenue the excess, if any, between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay, which is based on the rental contract period applicable to the actual number of days the equipment was out on rent, over the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date. In any given accounting period, the Company will have customers return equipment and be contractually required to pay more than the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date under the straight-line methodology. Also included in equipment rental revenue is re-rent revenue in which the Company will rent

Sales of new equipment Sales of parts and supplies Total 
 
 The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of rental equipment, new equipment, parts and supplies when control of the asset transfers to the customer, which is typically when the asset is picked up by or delivered to the customer and when significant risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer. Sales and other tax amounts collected from customers and remitted to government authorities are accounted for on a net basis and, therefore, excluded from revenue. 
 The Company routinely sells its used rental equipment in order to manage repair and maintenance costs, as well as the composition, age and size of its fleet. The Company disposes of used equipment through a variety of channels including retail sales to customers and other third parties, sales to wholesalers, brokered sales and auctions. 
 
 The Company also sells new equipment, parts and supplies. The types of new equipment that the Company sells vary by location and include a variety of ProContractor tools and supplies, small equipment (such as work lighting, generators, pumps, compaction equipment and power trowels), safety supplies and expendables. 
 Under Topic 606, the accounts receivable balance, prior to allowances for credit losses, for the sale of rental equipment, new equipment, parts and supplies, was approximately million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Service and other revenues 
 Service and other revenues primarily include revenue earned from equipment management and similar services for rental customers which includes providing customer support functions such as dedicated in-plant operations, plant management services, equipment and safety training, and repair and maintenance services particularly to industrial customers who request such services. 
 The Company recognizes revenue for service and other revenues as the services are provided. Service and other revenues are typically invoiced together with a customer s rental amounts and, therefore, it is not practical for the Company to separate the accounts receivable amount related to services and other revenues that are accounted for under Topic 606; however, such amount is not considered material.

 years, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to years. The Company determines the lease term used to record each lease by including the initial lease term and, in the case where there are options to extend, will include the option to extend if it has determined that it is reasonably certain that the Company would exercise those options. 
 
 The Company also leases certain equipment that it rents to its customers where the payments vary based upon the amount of time the equipment is on rent. There are no fixed payments on these leases and, therefore, no lease liability or ROU assets have been recorded. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. Lease expense for these leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

 ABL Credit Facility 
 On July 31, 2019, Herc Holdings, Herc and certain other subsidiaries of Herc Holdings entered into a credit agreement with respect to a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the "ABL Credit Facility"), which was amended and extended on July 5, 2022. The ABL Credit Facility provides for aggregate maximum borrowings of up to billion (subject to availability under a borrowing base). Up to million of the revolving loan facility is available for the issuance of letters of credit, subject to certain conditions including issuing lender participation. Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and limitations, the ABL Credit Facility allows for the addition of incremental revolving commitments and/or incremental term loans. The ABL Credit Facility matures on July 5, 2027. Additional information about the ABL Credit Facility is included in Note 11, "Debt" to the Company's financial statements included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

million to million. In connection with the AR Facility, Herc sells its accounts receivables on an ongoing basis to Herc Receivables U.S. LLC, a wholly-owned special-purpose entity (the "SPE"). The SPE's sole business consists of the purchase by the SPE of accounts receivable from Herc and borrowing by the SPE against the eligible accounts receivable from the lenders under the facility. The borrowings are secured by liens on the accounts receivable and other assets of the SPE. Collections on the accounts receivable are used to service the borrowings. The SPE is a separate legal entity that is consolidated in the Company's financial statements. The SPE assets are owned by the SPE and are not available to settle the obligations of the Company or any of its other subsidiaries. Herc is the servicer of the accounts receivable under the AR Facility. All of the obligations of the servicer and certain indemnification obligations of the SPE under the agreements governing the AR Facility are guaranteed by Herc pursuant to a performance guarantee. The AR Facility is excluded from current maturities of long-term debt as the Company has the intent and ability to fund the AR Facility's borrowings on a long-term basis either by further extending the maturity date of the AR Facility or by utilizing the capacity available at the balance sheet date under the ABL Credit Facility.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("MD A") should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Report, which include additional information about our accounting policies, practices and the transactions underlying our financial results. The preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes including receivables allowances, depreciation of rental equipment, the recoverability of long-lived assets, useful lives and impairment of long-lived tangible and intangible assets including goodwill and trade name, pension and postretirement benefits, valuation of stock-based compensation, reserves for litigation and other contingencies, accounting for income taxes and other matters arising during the normal course of business. We apply our best judgment, our knowledge of existing facts and circumstances and our knowledge of actions that we may undertake in the future in determining the estimates that will affect our condensed consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience, as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances, such as current economic conditions, and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results may differ from these estimates. 
 
 OVERVIEW OF OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING ENVIRONMENT 
 
 We are engaged principally in the business of renting equipment. Ancillary to our principal business of equipment rental, we also sell used rental equipment, sell new equipment and consumables and offer certain services and support to our customers. Our profitability is dependent upon a number of factors including the volume, mix and pricing of rental transactions and the utilization of equipment. Significant changes in the purchase price or residual values of equipment or interest rates can have a significant effect on our profitability depending on our ability to adjust pricing for these changes. Our business requires significant expenditures for equipment, and consequently we require substantial liquidity to finance such expenditures. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below. 
 
 Our revenues primarily are derived from rental and related charges and consist of: 
 
 Equipment rental (includes all revenue associated with the rental of equipment including ancillary revenue from delivery, rental protection programs and fueling charges); 
 Sales of rental equipment and sales of new equipment, parts and supplies; and 
 Service and other revenue (primarily relating to training and labor provided to customers). 
 
 Our expenses primarily consist of: 
 
 Direct operating expenses (primarily wages and related benefits, facility costs and other costs relating to the operation and rental of rental equipment, such as delivery, maintenance and fuel costs); 
 Cost of sales of rental equipment, new equipment, parts and supplies; 
 Depreciation expense relating to rental equipment; 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses; 
 Non-rental depreciation and amortization; and 
 Interest expense.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) 

Economic Conditions 
 
 Despite continued economic uncertainty, elevated interest rates, potential labor disruptions, and inflation, the equipment rental industry remains resilient, as demonstrated by the increase in volume on rent in the current quarter. We actively monitor the impact of the dynamic macroeconomic environment and manage our business to adjust to such conditions. Interest rates on our debt instruments remain elevated; most notably, the weighted average interest rate on our floating rate debt is currently at 6.35 , a decline from 6.81 in the third quarter of 2023, reflecting movement from interest rate cuts in the third quarter of 2024. We monitor our exposure to floating rate debt and reevaluate our capital allocation strategy, as necessary. In response to supply chain disruptions easing in certain categories of equipment, we have returned to a more normalized cadence of rental equipment expenditures and disposals, remaining mindful of the possibility we may experience more severe supply chain disruptions in the future. Although inflation appears to have stabilized, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience inflationary pressures, a portion of which, such as for fuel and delivery, is passed on to customers. There are other costs for which the pass through to customers is less direct, such as repairs and maintenance, and labor. We cannot predict the extent to which our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows will ultimately be impacted by these ongoing economic conditions, however, we believe we are well-positioned to operate effectively through the present environment. 
 
 Seasonality 
 
 Our business is seasonal, with demand for our rental equipment tending to be lower in the winter months, particularly in the northern United States and Canada. Our equipment rental business, especially in the construction industry, has historically experienced decreased levels of business from December until late spring and heightened activity during our third and fourth quarters until December. We have the ability to manage certain costs to meet market demand, such as fleet capacity, the most significant portion of our cost structure. For instance, to accommodate increased demand, we increase our available fleet and staff during the second and third quarters of the year. A number of our other major operating costs vary directly with revenues or transaction volumes; however, certain operating expenses, including rent, insurance and administrative overhead, remain fixed and cannot be adjusted for seasonal demand, typically resulting in higher profitability in periods when our revenues are higher, and lower profitability in periods when our revenues are lower. To reduce the impact of seasonality, we are focused on expanding our customer base through products that serve different industries with less seasonality and different business cycles.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Equipment rental revenue increased 101 million, or 13 , during the third quarter of 2024 due to higher volume of equipment on rent of 10.7 and pricing growth of 2.3 over the same period of the prior year. 
 
 Sales of rental equipment decreased 43 million, or 35 , during the third quarter of 2024 when compared to the third quarter of 2023. We continue to sell equipment in line with our fleet rotation planning to improve the equipment mix and manage fleet age. Fleet rotation in the prior year period was accelerated due to easing of supply chain disruptions in certain categories of equipment. The margin on sales of rental equipment was 19 in 2024 compared to 20 in 2023. The slight decrease in margin on sale of rental equipment in 2024 resulted from continued normalization of used equipment pricing in the market off peak pricing in prior years, partially offset by improvement in the mix of equipment sold in the higher margin retail and wholesale channels. 
 
 Direct operating expenses in the third quarter of 2024 increased 46 million, or 16 , when compared to the third quarter of 2023. Direct operating expenses were 38.6 of equipment rental revenue in 2024, compared to 37.6 in the prior-year period, reflecting increases in (i) personnel-related expenses of 20 million resulting from increased headcount in support of growth initiatives, including greenfields and acquisitions, (ii) maintenance expense of 6 million related to our increased fleet size in 2024, (iii) self insurance reserve increase of 6 million due to claims development attributable to unsettled cases, (iv) facilities expense of 5 million as we have added more locations through acquisitions and opening greenfield locations, and (v) re-rent expense of 4 million due to corresponding increase in re-rent revenue. 
 
 Depreciation of rental equipment increased 7 million, or 4 , during the third quarter of 2024 when compared to the third quarter of 2023 due to an increase in average fleet size. Non-rental depreciation and amortization increased 4 million, or 14 , primarily due to amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 8 million, or 7 , in the third quarter of 2024 when compared to the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases in selling expenses, including commissions and other variable compensation, of 6 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses were 14.2 of equipment rental revenue in 2024 compared to 15.0 in the prior-year period due to continued focus on improving operating leverage while expanding revenues. 
 
 Interest expense, net increased 9 million, or 15 , during the third quarter of 2024 when compared with the third quarter of 2023 due to increased borrowings primarily to fund acquisition growth and invest in rental equipment. 
 
 Income tax provision was 38 million, with an effective tax rate of 24 , during the third quarter of 2024 compared to 33 million and 23 in the same period of 2023. The rate increase was driven by certain non-deductible expenses and return to provision adjustments. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Equipment rental revenue increased 229 million, or 11 , during the nine months ended of 2024 due to higher volume of equipment on rent of 8.4 and pricing growth of 3.5 over the same period of the prior year. 
 
 Sales of rental equipment decreased 63 million, or 23 , during the nine months ended of 2024 when compared to the nine months ended of 2023. We continue to sell equipment in line with our fleet rotation planning to improve the equipment mix and manage fleet age. Fleet rotation in the prior year period was accelerated due to easing of supply chain disruptions in certain categories of equipment. The margin on sales of rental equipment was 27 in 2024 compared to 28 in 2023. The slight decrease in margin on sale of rental equipment in 2024 resulted from continued normalization of used equipment pricing in the market off peak pricing in prior years, partially offset by improvement in the mix of equipment sold in the higher margin retail and wholesale channels. 
 
 Direct operating expenses in the nine months ended of 2024 increased 116 million, or 14 , when compared to the nine months ended of 2023. Direct operating expenses were 41.1 of equipment rental revenue in 2024, compared to 40.1 in the prior-year period, reflecting increases in (i) personnel-related expenses of 50 million resulting from increased headcount in support of growth initiatives, including greenfields and acquisitions, (ii) self insurance reserve increase of 18 million due to claims development attributable to unsettled cases, (iii) facilities expense of 14 million as we have added more locations

through acquisitions and opening greenfield locations, (iv) maintenance expense of 12 million related to our increased fleet size in 2024, (v) re-rent expense of 9 million due to corresponding increase in re-rent revenue and (vi) delivery expense of 8 million due to increased volume of transactions and transfers of equipment between branches to drive fleet efficiency. 
 
 Depreciation of rental equipment increased 19 million, or 4 , during the nine months ended of 2024 when compared to the nine months ended of 2023 due to an increase in average fleet size. Non-rental depreciation and amortization increased 9 million, or 11 , primarily due to amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 26 million, or 8 , in the nine months ended of 2024 when compared to the nine months ended of 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases in selling expenses, including commissions and other variable compensation, of 14 million, general payroll and benefits of 4 million, and credit and collections expense of 3 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses were 15.2 of equipment rental revenue in 2024 compared to 15.7 in the prior-year period due to continued focus on improving operating leverage while expanding revenues. 
 
 Interest expense, net increased 31 million, or 19 , during the nine months ended of 2024 when compared with the nine months ended of 2023 due to increased borrowings primarily to fund acquisition growth and invest in rental equipment. 
 
 Income tax provision was 77 million, with an effective tax rate of 23 , during the nine months ended of 2024 compared to 68 million and 21 in the same period of 2023. The rate increase was driven by a reduction in the benefit related to stock-based compensation, certain non-deductible expenses and return to provision adjustments. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Our primary uses of liquidity include the payment of operating expenses, purchases of rental equipment to be used in our operations, servicing of debt, funding acquisitions, payment of dividends, and share repurchases. Our primary sources of funding are operating cash flows, cash received from the disposal of equipment and borrowings under our debt arrangements. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 4.2 billion of total nominal indebtedness outstanding. 
 
 Our liquidity as of September 30, 2024 consisted of cash and cash equivalents of 142 million and unused commitments of approximately 1.7 billion under our ABL Credit Facility and AR Facility. See "Borrowing Capacity and Availability" below for further discussion. Our practice is to maintain sufficient liquidity through cash from operations, our ABL Credit Facility and our AR Facility to mitigate the impacts of any adverse financial market conditions on our operations. We believe that cash generated from operations and cash received from the disposal of equipment, together with amounts available under the ABL Credit Facility and the AR Facility or other financing arrangements will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures, and other strategic uses of cash, if any, and debt payments, if any, over the next twelve months. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 Significant factors driving our liquidity position include cash flows generated from operating activities and capital expenditures. Historically, we have generated and expect to continue to generate positive cash flow from operations. Our ability to fund our capital needs will be affected by our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access to capital markets.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) 

The following table summarizes the change in cash and cash equivalents for the periods shown (in millions): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 894 796 98 Investing activities (1,243) (1,324) 81 Financing activities 420 545 (125) Effect of exchange rate changes Net change in cash and cash equivalents 71 17 54 
 Operating Activities 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated 98 million more cash from operating activities compared with the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily related to the timing of payments on accounts payable and accrued liabilities. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Cash used in investing activities decreased 81 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared with the prior-year period. Our primary use of cash in investing activities is for the acquisition of rental equipment, non-rental capital expenditures and acquisitions. Generally, we rotate our equipment and manage our fleet of rental equipment in line with customer demand and continue to invest in our information technology, service vehicles and facilities. Changes in our net capital expenditures are described in more detail in the "Capital Expenditures" section below. Additionally, we closed on eight acquisitions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 for a net cash outflow of 567 million. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Cash provided by financing activities decreased 125 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared with the prior-year period. Financing activities primarily represents our changes in debt, which included borrowings of 1.5 billion on our revolving lines of credit and securitization which were used primarily to fund acquisitions and invest in rental equipment during the period. This was offset by repayments of 1.8 billion through operations and the proceeds from the issuance of our 2029 Notes. Net borrowings in the prior year period were 739 million. 
 
 In order to reduce future cash interest payments, as well as future amounts due at maturity or upon redemption, we may from time to time repurchase our debt, including our notes, bonds, loans or other indebtedness, in privately negotiated, open market or other transactions and upon such terms and at such prices as we may determine. We will evaluate any such transactions in light of then-existing market conditions, taking into account our current liquidity and prospects for future access to capital. The repurchases may be material and could relate to a substantial proportion of a particular class or series, which could reduce the trading liquidity of such class or series. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 
 Our capital expenditures relate largely to purchases of rental equipment, with the remaining portion representing purchases of property, equipment, and information technology. The table below sets forth the capital expenditures related to our rental equipment and related disposals for the periods noted (in millions). 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Rental equipment expenditures 753 1,100 Disposals of rental equipment (198) (231) Net rental equipment expenditures 555 869

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) 

Net capital expenditures for rental equipment decreased 314 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. As the supply chain constraints have eased, our rental equipment expenditures have returned to taking deliveries and disposing of equipment in line with our normal seasonal cadence, while we continue to optimize our fleet by investing in high growth markets as part of our long-term capital expenditure plans. 
 Borrowing Capacity and Availability 
 
 Our ABL Credit Facility and AR Facility (together, the "Facilities") provide our borrowing capacity and availability. Creditors under the Facilities have a claim on specific pools of assets as collateral as identified in each credit agreement. Our ability to borrow under the Facilities is a function of, among other things, the value of the assets in the relevant collateral pool. We refer to the amount of debt we can borrow given a certain pool of assets as the "Borrowing Base." 
 
 In connection with the AR Facility, we sell accounts receivable on an ongoing basis to a wholly-owned special-purpose entity (the "SPE"). The accounts receivable and other assets of the SPE are encumbered in favor of the lenders under our AR Facility. The SPE assets are owned by the SPE and are not available to settle the obligations of the Company or any of its other subsidiaries. Substantially all of the remaining assets of Herc and certain of its U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries are encumbered in favor of our lenders under our ABL Credit Facility. None of such assets are available to satisfy the claims of our general creditors. See Note 11, "Debt" to the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 "Financial Statements" included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and Note 9, "Debt" included in Part I, Item 1 "Financial Statements" of this Report for more information. 
 
 With respect to the Facilities, we refer to "Remaining Capacity" as the maximum principal amount of debt permitted to be outstanding under the Facilities (i.e., the amount of debt we could borrow assuming we possessed sufficient assets as collateral) less the principal amount of debt then-outstanding under the Facility. We refer to "Availability Under Borrowing Base Limitation" as the lower of Remaining Capacity or the Borrowing Base less the principal amount of debt then-outstanding under the Facility (i.e., the amount of debt we could borrow given the collateral we possess at such time). 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the following was available to us (in millions): 
 Remaining Capacity Availability Under Borrowing Base Limitation ABL Credit Facility 1,733 1,733 AR Facility 10 10 Total 1,743 1,743 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, 34 million of standby letters of credit were issued and outstanding, none of which have been drawn upon. The ABL Credit Facility had 216 million available under the letter of credit facility sublimit, subject to borrowing base restrictions. 
 
 Covenants 
 
 Our ABL Credit Facility, our AR Facility and our Notes contain a number of covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict our ability to dispose of assets, incur additional indebtedness, incur guarantee obligations, prepay certain indebtedness, make certain restricted payments (including paying dividends, redeeming stock or making other distributions), create liens, make investments, make acquisitions, engage in mergers, fundamentally change the nature of our business, make capital expenditures, or engage in certain transactions with certain affiliates. 
 
 Under the terms of our ABL Credit Facility, our AR Facility and our Notes, we are not subject to ongoing financial maintenance covenants; however, under the ABL Credit Facility, failure to maintain certain levels of liquidity will subject us to a contractually specified fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1:1 for the four quarters most recently ended. As of September 30, 2024, the appropriate levels of liquidity have been maintained, therefore this financial maintenance covenant is not applicable.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in interest rates (including credit spreads), foreign currency exchange rates, and fluctuations in fuel prices. We manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments are viewed as risk management tools and have not been used for speculative or trading purposes. In addition, derivative financial instruments are entered into with a diversified group of major financial institutions in order to manage our exposure to counterparty nonperformance on such instruments. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, there has been no material change in the information reported under Part II, Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk," in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Share Repurchase Program 
 
 In March 2014, we announced a 1 billion share repurchase program (the "Share Repurchase Program"), which replaced an earlier program. The Share Repurchase Program permits us to purchase shares through a variety of methods, including in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable securities laws. We are not obligated to make any repurchases at any specific time or in any specific amount and our repurchases may be subject to certain predetermined price/volume guidelines, set from time-to-time, by our board of directors. The timing and extent to which we repurchase shares will depend upon, among other things, strategic priorities, market conditions, share price, liquidity targets, contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and other factors. Share repurchases may be commenced or suspended at any time or from time-to-time, subject to legal and contractual requirements, without prior notice. There were no share repurchases during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the approximate dollar value that remains available for share purchases under the Share Repurchase Program is 161 million.
