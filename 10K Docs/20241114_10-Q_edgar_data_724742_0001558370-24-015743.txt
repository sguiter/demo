As of the date of this filing, TPHGreenwich has not terminated the Asset Management Agreement, however there is no assurance of how long the Asset Management Agreement will remain in effect. On April 26, 2024, the Company and Mr. Messinger entered into an amendment (the Amendment to Mr. Messinger s employment agreement, dated as of October 1, 2013, as amended (the Employment Agreement ), and TPHGreenwich and Mr. Messinger entered into a consulting agreement (the Consulting Agreement ).

These payments, as well as the payments under the Consulting Agreement, will constitute full settlement with regards to any severance payable to Mr. Messinger under the Employment Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, Mr. Messinger has received of these payments. The last payment due to Mr. Messinger was made subsequent to September 30, 2024. Under the terms of the Amendment, for so long as Mr. Messinger is not in breach of the Amendment or the Consulting Agreement, to the extent that a seat on the Company s board of directors is then available, until June 30, 2026, the Company Investor will exercise its vote as shareholder in favor of electing Mr. Messinger to the Company s board of directors, in addition to its existing board appointment rights.

We have a limited amount of unrestricted cash and liquidity available for working capital and our cash needs are variable under different circumstances. If the Asset Management Agreement does not remain in place and the related fees are not increased significantly , the Company s cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to fund the Company s operations and corporate expenses beyond the next few months, unless we are able to raise additional capital or enter into a strategic transaction, creating substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. With the Company now unencumbered by its real estate and related liabilities, we continue to focus on exploring a range of strategic and financing alternatives to maximize stockholder value and to engage with parties that have expressed interest in the Company s attributes and assets and may see the Company as a potential vehicle for growth, with potential opportunities to recapitalize the Company at a lower cost of capital. The Company previously engaged Houlihan Lokey and Ackman-Ziff to act as advisors in connection with our strategic review process and to assist us in identifying and evaluating potential alternatives, including among others securing an equity and/or debt financing of the Company, refinancing of existing debt, and/or a sale or merger or reverse merger of the Company. There is no assurance that we will be successful in consummating any such strategic transaction on terms or a timeframe acceptable to us or at all. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of any uncertainty as to our ability to continue as a going concern.

 , and our unrecorded share of suspended losses was approximately million. At least quarterly, management assesses whether there are any other than temporary impairment indicators of the Company s investments in real estate ventures. If any indicators of impairment are present, we calculate the fair value of the investment in the unconsolidated real estate venture. An investment is other than temporarily impaired only if the fair value of the investment in a real estate venture, as estimated by management, is less than the carrying value and the decline is other than temporary. To the extent that an other than temporary impairment has occurred, an impairment charge is recorded in the amount of the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the estimated fair value. Management is required to make significant judgments about the estimated fair value of its investments to determine if an impairment exists. Fair value is generally determined through income valuation approaches, including discounted cash flows and direct capitalization models or a sales comparison approach. When the Company acquires an interest in or contributes assets to a real estate venture project, the difference between the Company s cost basis in the investment and the value of the real estate venture or asset contributed is amortized over the life of the related assets, intangibles, and liabilities and such adjustment is included in the Company s share of equity in income of unconsolidated real estate ventures. In connection with the Recapitalization Transaction, all assets and liabilities contributed to TPHGreenwich were transferred at fair value. This resulted in a gain on contribution to joint venture of approximately million and was recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2024. reportable segment, commercial real estate.

 Tenant improvements Furniture and fixtures Land and land improvements Less: accumulated depreciation Building and building improvements, tenant improvements, furniture and fixtures, and land and land improvements included the 237 11 th property and the Paramus, New Jersey property as of December 31, 2023. Depreciation expense amounted to approximately for the period January 1, 2024 through February 14, 2024, and and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. In May 2018, we closed on the acquisition of 237 11 th , a 105-unit, 12-story multi-family apartment building located at 237 11 th Street, Brooklyn, New York for a purchase price of million, excluding transaction costs of approximately million. Due to water damage in apartment units and other property at 237 11 th resulting from construction defects, we submitted a notice of claim to our insurance carrier for property damage and business interruption (lost revenue) in September 2018. The insurance carrier subsequently disclaimed coverage for the losses and we filed a complaint against the carrier alleging that it breached the insurance policy by denying coverage. We also filed legal claims against the seller, its parent company, and the general contractor to recover damages arising from the defective construction of the building, including defects that resulted in water damage as well as other defects. In addition, the general contractor impleaded into that litigation several subcontractors who performed work on the property. Management expects that TPHGreenwich will recover some portion of the cost incurred to repair the property through the litigations and/or settlement negotiations with the seller, its parent company, the general contractor, the subcontractors, and the insurance carrier, although the amount of damages that may be recoverable in litigation and/or potential settlement negotiations are uncertain at this time, as is the timing of receipt of any such payments, which has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the resulting backlog in the court system and slowdown in judicial proceedings. We have, from time to time, engaged in mediation with the seller, its parent company, the general contractor, and the third-party defendants impleaded by the general contractor to explore the possibility of settling the case involving those parties, but to date, we have not reached an agreement, and we continue to pursue all legal remedies.

See Item 2. Properties below for a more detailed description of these properties. We also control a variety of intellectual property assets focused on the consumer sector, a legacy of our predecessor, Syms Corp. Syms ), including FilenesBasement.com, our rights to the Stanley Blacker brand, as well as the intellectual property associated with the Running of the Brides event and An Educated Consumer is Our Best Customer slogan. In addition, we also had approximately 350.7 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards NOLs and other tax loss carryforwards at September 30, 2024, as well as approximately 382.7 million of various state and local NOLs and other tax loss carryforwards at September 30, 2024, which can be used to reduce our future taxable income and capital gains. Recapitalization Transactions On February 14, 2024, we consummated the transactions contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of January 5, 2024 (as amended, the Stock Purchase Agreement ), between the Company, TPHS Lender LLC, the lender under the Company s Corporate Credit Facility (the Company Investor and TPHS Investor LLC, an affiliate of the Company Investor (the JV Investor , and together with the Company Investor, the Investor ), pursuant to which (i) the Company Investor purchased 25,112,245 shares of common stock, par value 0.01 per share of the Company (the Investor Shares for a purchase price of 0.30 per share, (ii) the Company and the JV Investor entered into an amended and restated limited liability company operating agreement of TPHGreenwich (the JV Operating Agreement ), pursuant to which the JV Investor was appointed the initial manager of, and acquired a five percent (5 interest in, TPHGreenwich, as described in more detail below, and TPHGreenwich continues to own, indirectly, all of the real property assets and liabilities of the Company, and (iii) TPHGreenwich entered into an asset management agreement (the Asset Management Agreement with a newly formed subsidiary of the Company (the TPH Manager ), pursuant to which TPHGreenwich hired the TPH Manager to act as initial asset manager for TPHGreenwich for an annual management fee, as described in more detail below (collectively, the Recapitalization Transactions ).

We believe that the Recapitalization Transactions allow for an improved structure for a new investor to invest in the Company, which is less complex as a result of the real estate assets and substantially all liabilities being off-balance sheet. In addition, the parties agreed to certain provisions in the Stock Purchase Agreement to accommodate a new strategic partner that may invest in the Company.

As noted below and previously disclosed, Mr. Messinger transitioned from Chief Executive Officer of the Company (i.e., TPH Manager) to consultant to TPHGreenwich in August 2024. Mr. Messinger continues to serve as a member of the Board and also, for the time being, as interim principal executive officer for SEC purposes. While TPHGreenwich has not indicated an intention to terminate the Asset Management Agreement, however there is no assurance of how long the Asset Management Agreement will remain in effect. On April 26, 2024, the Company and Mr. Messinger entered into an amendment (the Amendment to Mr. Messinger s employment agreement, dated as of October 1, 2013, as amended (the Employment Agreement ), and TPHGreenwich and Mr. Messinger entered into a consulting agreement (the Consulting Agreement ). Under the Amendment, the Company agreed to make certain payments to Mr. Messinger in exchange for Mr. Messinger s agreement to continue his employment as chief executive officer of the Company until the later of July 31, 2024 or the filing of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2024, unless extended by the parties (the Termination Date ).

Under the Consulting Agreement, Mr. Messinger has agreed to provide certain consulting services as an independent contractor to TPHGreenwich related to the properties owned by TPHGreenwich, in exchange for certain consulting payments. The Consulting Agreement will remain in effect until June 1, 2026, unless sooner terminated in accordance with its terms. Liquidity and Going Concern; Management s Plans and Objectives Following the Recapitalization Transactions, our primary business is owning approximately 700 million of federal, and various state and local NOLs and other tax loss carryforwards and a variety of intellectual property assets focused on the consumer sector, as well as a 95 interest in TPHGreenwich and acting as asset manager for the properties owned by TPHGreenwich. We have a limited amount of unrestricted cash and liquidity available for working capital and our cash needs are variable under different circumstances. If the Asset Management Agreement does not remain in place and the related fees are not increased significantly , the Company s cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to fund the Company s operations and corporate expenses beyond the next few months, unless we are able to raise additional capital or enter into a strategic transaction, creating substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. With the Company now unencumbered by its real estate and related liabilities, we continue to focus on exploring a range of strategic and financing alternatives to maximize stockholder value and to engage with parties that have expressed interest in the Company s attributes and assets and may see the Company as a potential vehicle for growth, with potential opportunities to recapitalize the Company at a lower cost of capital. The Company previously engaged Houlihan Lokey and Ackman-Ziff to act as advisors in connection with our strategic review process and to assist us in identifying and

 evaluating potential alternatives, including among others securing an equity and/or debt financing of the Company, refinancing of existing debt, and/or a sale or merger or reverse merger of the Company. The Company has entered into a letter of intent with an unaffiliated third party in connection with a potential strategic transaction. T here is no assurance that we will be successful in consummating any such strategic transaction on terms or a timeframe acceptable to us or at all, with that party or any other party. On July 30, 2024, the NYSE American announced that it was commencing proceedings to delist the Company s common stock, and the Company was delisted on August 19, 2024. The Company currently trades on the OTC Markets under the symbol TPHS. Properties Below is certain information regarding the real estate properties held by TPHGreenwich as of September 30, 2024:

 (1) 77 Greenwich. TPHGreenwich has substantially completed the construction of an over 300,000 gross square foot mixed-use building that corresponds to the approximate total of 233,000 zoning square feet. The property consists of 90 luxury residential condominium apartments, 7,500 square feet of retail space, almost all of which is street level, a 476-seat elementary school serving New York City District 2, including the adaptive reuse of the landmarked Robert and Anne Dickey House. As of March 3, 2023, this property had received its temporary certificates of occupancy TCOs for 100 of the residential condominium units, lobby, Cloud Club (lounge, terrace, game room, dining room, kitchen and kids play room), mechanical rooms, and portions of the cellar (including the bike and storage rooms.) We have closed on the sale of 44 residential condominium units through September 30, 2024, with 46 remaining units to sell as of November 14, 2024. We entered into an agreement with the New York City School Construction Authority (the SCA ), whereby we constructed a school sold to the SCA as part of our condominium development at 77 Greenwich. Pursuant to the agreement, the SCA agreed to pay us 41.5 million for the purchase of their condominium unit and reimburse us for the costs associated with constructing the school, including a construction supervision fee of approximately 5.0 million. Payments for construction are being made by the SCA to the general contractor in installments as construction on their condominium unit progresses. Payments to us for the land and construction supervision fee commenced in January 2018 and continued through October 2019 for the land and will continue through completion of the SCA buildout for the construction supervision fee. An aggregate of 46.4 million had been paid to us by the SCA as of September 30, 2024 with approximately 176,000 remaining to be paid to TPHGreenwich. We have also received an aggregate of 56.1 million in reimbursable construction costs from the SCA through September 30, 2024. In April 2020, the SCA closed on the purchase of the school condominium unit from us, at which point title transferred to the SCA. The SCA has completed the buildout of the interior space, which is a public elementary school with approximately 476 seats. The school received its final TCO and opened to students in September 2022. There is an inherent risk that the development and sales of residential condominiums may be subject to unknown potential changes in internal and external financial and economic conditions, such as inflation and rising interest rates, and general market conditions, which could impact the business and potential buyers of the residential condominiums for sale. In addition, construction work is ongoing and there continue to be delays and issues the impact of which is

 not yet known. We believe it is possible under generally accepted accounting practices to incur real estate impairment charges in the future in the event these conditions deteriorate . (2) Paramus Property. The Paramus property consists of a one-story and partial two-story, 73,000 square foot freestanding building and an outparcel building of approximately 4,000 square feet, for approximately 77,000 total square feet of rentable space. The primary building is comprised of approximately 47,000 square feet of ground floor space, and two separate mezzanine levels of approximately 21,000 and 5,000 square feet. The 73,000 square foot building is leased to Restoration Hardware Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: RH) pursuant to a license agreement that began on June 1, 2016, is terminable upon three months notice, and currently is scheduled to end on March 31, 2025. The outparcel building was leased under a short-term license agreement with a tenant whose lease began on October 1, 2023 and ends June 30, 2025. The land area of the Paramus property consists of approximately 292,000 square feet, or approximately 6.7 acres. TPHGreenwich is currently exploring options with respect to a potential sale of the Paramus property. (3) 237 11 th Street. In 2018, we acquired a 105-unit, 12-story multi-family apartment building encompassing approximately 93,000 gross square feet (approximately 80,000 rentable square feet) located at 237 11 th Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn, New York for a purchase price of 81.2 million, excluding transaction costs of approximately 0.7 million. The property also includes 6,264 square feet of retail space, all of which is leased to Starbucks Inc. (NQGS:SBUX), an oral surgeon and a health and wellness tenant. Located on the border of the Park Slope and Gowanus neighborhoods of Brooklyn, the property is located one block from the 4th Avenue/9th Street subway station. The 237 11 th property offers an array of modern amenities that surpass what is available in the neighborhood s brownstone housing stock. The property also benefits from a 15-year Section 421-a real estate tax exemption. Although all apartments are market rate units, they are subject to New York City s rent stabilization law during the remaining term of the Section 421-a real estate tax exemption. Due to the approval of the Gowanus up-zoning, this property benefitted to the extent of approximately 30,000 square feet of air rights. Due to water damage in apartment units and other property at 237 11 th resulting from construction defects which we believe were concealed by the prior ownership team and its contractor, we submitted a notice of claim to our insurance carrier for property damage and business interruption (lost revenue) in September 2018. The insurance carrier subsequently disclaimed coverage for the losses and we filed a complaint against the carrier alleging that it breached the insurance policy by denying coverage. We also filed legal claims against the seller, its parent company, and the general contractor to recover damages arising from defective construction of the building, including defects that resulted in water damage as well as other defects. In addition, the general contractor impleaded into that litigation several subcontractors who performed work on the property. Management expects that TPHGreenwich will recover some portion of the cost incurred to repair the property through the litigations and/or settlement negotiations with the seller, its parent company, the general contractor, the subcontractors, and the insurance carrier, although the amount of damages that may be recoverable in litigation and/or potential settlement negotiations are uncertain at this time, as is the timing of receipt of any such payments. TPHGreenwich will continue to pursue all legal remedies. We incurred significant cash outflows for costs associated with these repairs and remediation, which commenced in September 2019 and were completed as of December 31, 2021. TPH Greenwich has entered into a non-binding letter of intent for the sale of the property at 237 11 th . There is no assurance that the sale will occur, or if it does, what the terms will be for such sale. Lease Expirations As of September 30, 2024, TPHGreenwich had one retail license at its Paramus property encompassing 73,000 square feet of leased space with annualized rent of 540,000 per year and expiring in March 2025 and a short-term license for the outparcel building began October 1, 2023 and expiring on June 30, 2025. As of September 30, 2024, TPHGreenwich also had a retail lease at the 237 11 th property encompassing 2,006 square feet of leased space with annualized rent of 130,000 per year that expires in 2027, a second retail lease at the 237 11 th property encompassing 1,074 square feet of leased space with average annualized rent of 94,506 per year that expires in 2036 and a third retail lease at the 237 11 th property encompassing 2,208 square feet of leased space with average annualized rent of 153,366 per year that expires in 2032. As of September 30, 2024, TPHGreenwich also had a retail lease at 77 Greenwich encompassing 1,061 square feet of leased space with an average annualized rent of 88,085 per year that expires in 2034. All TPHGreenwich s other leases are residential leases most of which expire within twelve or twenty-four months of the commencement date.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America GAAP ). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates. A summary of our significant accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are included in this report (see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Basis of Presentation to our consolidated financial statements for further information). Certain of the accounting policies used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are particularly important for an understanding of the financial position and results of operations presented in the historical consolidated financial statements included in this report and require the application of significant judgment by management and, as a result, are subject to a degree of uncertainty. We believe there have been no material changes to the items that we disclosed as our critical accounting policies under Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K (as amended, the 2023 Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2023. The following discussion and analysis is intended to assist readers in understanding our financial condition and results of operations during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our 2023 Annual Report. As a result of the closing of the Recapitalization Transactions on February 14, 2024, the results of operations and the cash flows for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 may not be comparable. Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 There was no rental revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to total rental revenues of 1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This is due to the Recapitalization Transactions mentioned above whereby TPHGreenwich is recording all of the rental revenue. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, rental revenues were approximately 1.4 million and tenant reimbursements were approximately 46,000. Other income increased by approximately 368,000 to 397,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 29,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, this income represents the management fee earned from TPHGreenwich. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the income was from the SCA s construction supervision fee. There were no sales of residential condominium units at 77 Greenwich for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 9.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This is due to the Recapitalization Transactions mentioned above whereby TPHGreenwich is recording the sales of residential condominium units. We closed on three residential condominium units during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Units that we closed during 2023 were generally lower priced, smaller units on the building s lower floors. Property operating expenses decreased by approximately 769,000 to 17,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 786,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in property operating expenses was due to the Recapitalization Transactions mentioned above as most of the operating expenses are recorded at TPHGreenwich. Property operating expenses consisted primarily of expenses incurred for utilities, payroll, and general operating expenses as well as repairs and maintenance and leasing commission at 237 11 th , general operating expenses at 77 Greenwich, including marketing costs, and to a lesser extent expenses related to the Paramus, New Jersey property. There was no real estate tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 668,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

These costs represent professional fees and other periodic pension costs incurred in connection with the legacy Syms Pension Plan (see Note 9 Pension Plan to our consolidated financial statements for further information). There was no cost of sales residential condominium units at 77 Greenwich for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 9.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This is due to the Recapitalization Transactions mentioned above whereby TPHGreenwich is recording the cost of sales of residential condominium units.

Unrealized gain on warrants was 14,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This represents the change in the fair market valuation of the warrants due mainly to the change in our stock price on the measurement date. There was no interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 7.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This is due to the Recapitalization Transactions mentioned above whereby TPHGreenwich is recording the interest expense.

 Transactions mentioned above, and interest expense, partially offset by equity in net loss from unconsolidated joint ventures. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of September 30, 2024, we had total cash and restricted cash of 1.3 million, of which approximately 505,000 was cash and cash equivalents and approximately 743,000 was restricted cash. Under the Recapitalization Transactions, the real estate assets and related liabilities as well as the Corporate Credit Facility became part of TPHGreenwich, with the Company retaining the substantial federal, state and local tax NOLs and other tax loss carryforwards, intellectual property and a 95 equity interest in TPHGreenwich. In addition, the maturity date of each of the 77G Mortgage Loan and the 77G Mezzanine Loan was extended to October 23, 2025 with an option to extend for an additional year, and the maturity date of the Corporate Credit Facility was extended to June 30, 2026. In addition, we were released from all guarantees arising under these loan agreements subsequent to the closing of the Recapitalization Transactions. As part of the amendment, we re-affirmed our guaranty under the Secured Line of Credit. For a discussion regarding these loan agreements, see Note 7 Loans Payable and Secured Line of Credit to our consolidated financial statements. Cash Position As part of the Recapitalization Transactions, the CCF, 77G Mortgage Loan and 77G Mezzanine Loan were amended and extended, and were transferred to TPHGreenwich. As of November 13, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately 600,000. We have a limited amount of unrestricted cash and liquidity available for working capital and our cash needs are variable under different circumstances. If the Asset Management Agreement does not remain in place and the related fees are not increased significantly , the Company s cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to fund the Company s operations and corporate expenses beyond the next few months, unless we are able to raise additional capital or enter into a strategic transaction, creating substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Cash Flows Cash Flows for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Net cash used in operating activities increased by approximately 6.1 million to 7.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was mainly due to the Recapitalization Transactions that occurred on February 14, 2024 whereby Trinity transferred assets and liabilities, including restricted cash, to the TPHGreenwich. Net cash used in investing activities increased by approximately 14.0 million to 6.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash provided by investing activities of 7.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The cash used in investing activities was due to the Recapitalization Transactions that occurred on February 14, 2024 whereby Trinity transferred cash to TPHGreenwich. The cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to 7.2 million in sale proceeds from the sale of our 10 interest in the 250 North 10 th joint venture property in February 2023. Net cash provided by financing activities increased by approximately 26.0 million to 6.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash used in financing activities of 19.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net cash provided by financing activities primarily relates to the proceeds from loans and corporate credit facility of approximately 2.5 million as well as the approximate 4.4 million, net of expenses, from the sale of common stock related to the Recapitalization Transactions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the approximate 25.9 million in repayments of loans, corporate credit facility and notes payable for the nine months ending September 30, 2023 partially offset by 7.0 million in borrowings from the loans, corporate credit facility and secured line of credit for the nine months ending September 30, 2023. Net Operating Losses Our U.S. federal NOLs as of the emergence date of the Syms bankruptcy were approximately 162.8 million. As of September 30, 2024, our U.S. federal NOLs and other tax loss carryforwards, and state NOLs and other tax loss 

 33 

Table of Contents 
 carryforwards were approximately 350.7 million and 331.9 million, respectively, and our New York State and New York City prior NOL conversion subtraction pools were approximately 27.9 million and 22.9 million, respectively. In connection with the conveyance of the school condominium to the SCA, we applied approximately 11.6 million of federal NOLs against taxable capital gains of approximately 18.5 million. Since 2009 through September 30, 2024, we have utilized approximately 20.1 million of the federal NOLs. Based on management s assessment, it is more likely than not that the entire deferred tax assets will not be realized by future taxable income or tax planning strategies. Accordingly, a valuation allowance of 88.1 million was recorded as of September 30, 2024. We believe that certain of the transactions that occurred in connection with our emergence from bankruptcy in September 2012, including the rights offering and the redemption of the Syms shares owned by the former majority shareholder of Syms in accordance with the Plan, resulted in us undergoing an ownership change, as that term is used in Section 382 of the Code. However, while the analysis is complex and subject to subjective determinations and uncertainties, we believe that we should qualify for treatment under Section 382(l)(5) of the Code. As a result, we believe that our NOLs are not subject to an annual limitation under Section 382. However, if we were to undergo a subsequent ownership change in the future, our ability to utilize our NOLs could be subject to limitation under Section 382. In addition, the TCJA limited the deductibility of NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 to 80 percent of taxable income (computed without regard to the net operating loss deduction) for the taxable year. However, the CARES Act suspended the 80 limitation on the use of NOLs for tax years beginning before January 1, 2021, and allowed losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2021 to be carried back up to five years. Even if all of our regular U.S. federal income tax liability for a given year is reduced to zero by virtue of utilizing our NOLs, we may still be subject to state, local or other non-federal income taxes. Our certificate of incorporation includes a provision intended to help preserve certain tax benefits primarily associated with our NOLs. This provision generally prohibits transfers of stock that would result in a person or group of persons becoming a 4.75 stockholder, or that would result in an increase or decrease in stock ownership by a person or group of persons that is an existing 4.75 stockholder. This provision expires by its terms on February 12, 2025, ten years after its adoption. The Company intends to extend this provision prior to its expiration or implement a similar mechanism to preserve such benefits.

 In evaluating such statements, you should specifically consider the risks identified under the section entitled Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on March 29, 2024, as amended on April 29, 2024, and under the section entitled Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, any of which could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results or outcomes may vary materially from those contemplated by any forward looking statements. Subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements in this paragraph and elsewhere described in our 2023 Annual Report, this Form 10-Q and other reports filed with the SEC. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Form 10-Q or, in the case of any documents incorporated by reference in this Form 10-Q, the date of such document, in each case based on information available to us as of such date, and we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the disclosure required by this Item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based closely on the definition of disclosure controls and procedures in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within the Company to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in our periodic reports. Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under 

 36 

Table of Contents 
 the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. b) Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings In the normal course of business, we are party to routine legal proceedings. Based on advice of counsel and available information, including current status or stage of proceedings, and taking into account accruals where they have been established, management currently believes that any liabilities ultimately resulting from litigation we are currently involved in will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Item 1A. Risk Factors Numerous factors affect our business and results of operations, many of which are beyond our control. In addition to information set forth in this Quarterly Report, you should carefully read and consider "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in Part I and "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II of our 2023 Annual Report, which describe significant risks that may cause our actual results of operations in future periods to differ materially from those currently anticipated or expected. We have a limited amount of unrestricted cash and liquidity. We expect to have insufficient cash and liquidity to pay operating expenses and other obligations beyond the next few months, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Our liquidity will be further limited if our Asset Management Agreement does not remain in place. If we are not successful in raising additional capital or entering into a strategic transaction, we will be forced to consider all available alternatives, including filing for bankruptcy protection, liquidating or dissolving. We have a limited amount of unrestricted cash and liquidity available for working capital and our cash needs are variable under different circumstances. If the Asset Management Agreement does not remain in place and the related fees are not increased significantly , the Company s cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to fund the Company s operations and corporate expenses beyond the next few months, unless we are able to raise additional capital or enter into a strategic transaction, creating substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. There is no assurance that we will be successful in consummating any such strategic transaction or obtaining capital sufficient to meet our operating needs, in each case, on terms or a timeframe acceptable to us or at all. Even if a strategic transaction and/or other transaction is entered into, the benefits to shareholders, if any, of such transactions are uncertain. Further, in the event that we are unable to identify or consummate such transactions, we would be required to evaluate additional alternatives in restructuring our business and our capital structure, including but not limited to, filing for bankruptcy protection, liquidating, dissolving and/or seeking another out-of-court restructuring of our liabilities or liquidation. See Part I. Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Liquidity and Capital Resources and Note 1 - Business to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our ability to continue as a going concern and related matters. Following the departure of our president and chief executive officer, upon whom we have depended to operate our business, there can be no assurance that a replacement principal executive officer will be identified, which would adversely affect our business . Under the terms of the Amendment to Mr. Messinger s Employment Agreement, Mr. Messinger agreed to continue his employment as chief executive officer until the filing of the Company s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024, and he transitioned from Chief Executive Officer of the Company to consultant to TPHGreenwich in August 2024. Mr. Messinger continues to serve as a member of the Board and also, for the time being, 

 37 

Table of Contents 
 as interim principal executive officer for SEC purposes. The Company is currently evaluating next steps for identifying a new principal executive officer, however no replacement for Mr. Messinger has been identified as of the date of this filing. Given our limited cash position, it will be difficult for the Company to attract a replacement principal executive officer, and there is no assurance that our efforts will be successful. In addition, under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Company is required to have a principal executive officer certify that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that material information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. If the Company is unable to identify a replacement principal executive officer, it will not be able to make its required filings with the SEC. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities None. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities None. Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities None. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not Applicable. Item 5. Other Information Trading Arrangements During the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, none of our directors and officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act) or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.
