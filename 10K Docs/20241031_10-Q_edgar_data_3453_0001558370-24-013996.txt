These statements are considered forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements may be contained in, among other things, SEC filings such as Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, the Company s Annual Report to Shareholders, the Company s Sustainability Report, press releases made by the Company, the Company s Internet websites (including websites of its subsidiaries), and oral statements made by officers of the Company.

THIRD QUARTER 2024 DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK FOR 2024 Ocean Transportation: The Company s container volume in the Hawaii service in the third quarter 2024 was 2.2 percent lower year-over-year. The decrease was primarily due to lower general demand . Hawaii s economy continues to grow slowly with stalled growth in statewide tourist arrivals due to declines in Maui tourism following last year s wildfires and the sluggish pace of recovery in Japanese tourist arrivals which have been impacted by weakness in the yen to the U.S. dollar exchange rate. The Company expects volume for the full year 2024 to be modestly lower than the level achieved in 2023, primarily due to low-to-no growth in tourism, continued challenges in population growth and lower discretionary income as a result of higher inflation and interest rates. In China, the Company achieved significantly higher freight rates in the third quarter 2024 compared to the year ago period. The Company s container volume in the third quarter 2024 also increased 2.6 percent year-over-year due to two

 additional sailings. The elevated freight rates were primarily due to a traditional peak season with strong freight demand leading to significantly higher year-over-year freight rates for both the CLX and MAX services. A resilient U.S. economy and a stable consumer demand environment coupled with tighter supply chain conditions supported these elevated freight rates. In the near term, the Company expects its China service freight rates in the fourth quarter to remain elevated and to be significantly higher than the levels achieved in the year ago period as long as the underlying economic, supply chain, and geopolitical conditions persist. Regardless, the Company remains focused on continuing to deliver a differentiated value proposition as compared to air freight with CLX and MAX services as the two fastest and most reliable expedited ocean services in the Transpacific. In Guam, the Company s container volume in the third quarter 2024 decreased 9.4 percent year-over-year. The decrease was primarily due to lower demand from retail and food and beverage segments. In the near term, the Company expects the Guam economy to remain stable with a low unemployment rate, but slow growth in tourism. For the full year 2024, the Company expects volume to be lower than the level achieved last year. In Alaska, the Company s container volume for the third quarter 2024 increased 1.4 percent year-over-year primarily due to higher retail-related demand. In the near term, the Company expects continued economic growth in Alaska supported by a low unemployment rate, jobs growth and lower levels of inflation. For the full year 2024, the Company expects volume to approximate the level achieved last year. The contribution in the third quarter 2024 from the Company s SSAT joint venture investment was 6.9 million, or 5.6 million higher than the third quarter 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher lift volume. For 2024, the Company expects the contribution from SSAT to be higher than the levels achieved in 2023 due to an expected increase in lift volume. As a result of the outlook trends noted above, the Company expects fourth quarter 2024 operating income for Ocean Transportation to be meaningfully higher than the 66.4 million achieved in the fourth quarter 2023. Logistics: In the third quarter 2024, operating income for the Company s Logistics segment was 15.4 million, or 1.5 million higher compared to the level achieved in the third quarter 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher contributions from supply chain management and transportation brokerage. The Company expects operating income in the fourth quarter of 2024 to be modestly higher than the level achieved last year. Consolidated Operating Income: The Company expects Matson s fourth quarter 2024 consolidated operating income to be meaningfully higher than the 75.3 million achieved in the fourth quarter 2023. Depreciation and Amortization: For full year 2024, the Company expects depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately 180 million, inclusive of dry-docking amortization of approximately 27 million. Interest Income: The Company expects interest income for the full year 2024 to be approximately 47 million. This includes the receipt on April 19, 2024 of 10.2 million in interest income earned on the federal tax refund related to the Company s 2021 federal tax return. Interest Expense: The Company expects interest expense for the full year 2024 to be approximately 8 million. Other Income (Expense): The Company expects full year 2024 other income (expense) to be approximately 7 million in income, which is attributable to the amortization of certain components of net periodic benefit costs or gains related to the Company s pension and post-retirement plans. Income Taxes: In the third quarter 2024, the Company s effective tax rate was 21.2 percent. For the fourth quarter 2024, the Company expects its effective tax rate to be approximately 22.0 percent. Capital and Vessel Dry-docking Expenditures: In the third quarter 2024, the Company made capital expenditure payments excluding vessel construction expenditures of 58.0 million, capitalized vessel construction expenditures of 1.6 million, and dry-docking payments of 2.9 million. For the full year 2024, the Company expects to make other capital expenditure payments, including maintenance capital expenditures, of approximately 110 to 120 million, new vessel construction expenditures (including capitalized interest and owner s items) of approximately 77 million,

The increase in interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was due to increased amounts of cash and cash equivalent, and CCF funds that were invested in interest bearing accounts during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was due to lower outstanding debt during the period, and a higher offset of capitalized interest related to the construction of new vessels. Other income (expense) relates to the amortization of certain components of net periodic benefit costs or gains related to the Company s pension and post-retirement plans. Income tax expense was 53.7 million, or 21.2 percent of income before taxes, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 20.3 million, or 14.5 percent of income before taxes, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023 benefited from a 7.8 percent deduction primarily related to foreign-derived intangible income FDII under Section 250 of the Internal Revenue Code that lowered the effective tax rate as a result of the return-to-provision process. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 benefited from a 0.6 percent deduction related to return-to-provision true-ups primarily due to FDII that lowered the effective tax rate.
