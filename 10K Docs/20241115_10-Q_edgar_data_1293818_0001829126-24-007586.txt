OpGen, Inc. and Subsidiaries 

 Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

 September 30, 2024 

shares of Series E Convertible Preferred Stock Series E Preferred Stock to Mr. Lazar at a price of per share for aggregate gross proceeds of million. In connection with the transactions contemplated by the March 2024 Purchase Agreement, the members of the Board of Directors, prior to the closing of such transactions, resigned and a new Board of Directors was appointed, of which Mr. Lazar was appointed Chairman. Furthermore, in April 2024, the Company entered into an employment agreement with David E. Lazar, pursuant to which the Company engaged Mr. Lazar to act as its Chief Executive Officer CEO ). 

In April 2024, the Company entered into a lease assignment agreement where the Company assigned the lease of its Rockville, Maryland headquarters to a third party. The Company s security deposit remains with the landlord and will be repaid over time as agreed upon with the third party assignee. The Company has a continuing liability under the lease; however, within the lease assignment agreement, the new tenant indemnifies the Company from and against any liabilities resulting from obligations arising on or after the lease assignment date. 

In May 2024, the Company announced that it intended to effect a reverse stock split (the Reverse Stock Split of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value 0.01 per share (the Common Stock ), at a ratio of 1 post-reverse-split share for every 10 pre-reverse-split shares (the Reverse Split Ratio ). The Common Stock continued to be traded on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol OPGN and began trading on a split-adjusted basis when the markets opened on Monday, May 20, 2024, under a new CUSIP number, 68373L505. The Reverse Stock Split impacted all holders of OpGen s common stock proportionally and did not impact any stockholders percentage ownership of common stock (except to the extent the Reverse Stock Split resulted in any stockholder owning a fractional share). No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Stockholders of record who were otherwise entitled to receive a fractional share received a whole share in lieu of the fractional share. All share amounts and per share prices in this Quarterly Report have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split. 

In July 2024, Mr. Lazar consummated a transaction pursuant to which he sold shares of Series E Preferred Stock together with his rights to purchase the additional 2,450,000 shares of Series E Preferred Stock under the March 2024 Purchase Agreement to AEI Capital Ltd. Subsequently, AEI Capital Ltd. paid the Company million in August 2024 in exchange for the remaining shares of Series E Preferred Stock under the terms of the March 2024 Purchase Agreement. All shares of Series E Preferred Stock were converted into shares of the Company s common stock in August 2024. As of September 30, 2024, shares of Series E Preferred Stock remain outstanding. Upon conversion, such shares of Series E Preferred Stock resumed the status of authorized but unissued shares of undesignated preferred stock of the Company. 

Under the ownership of AEI Capital Ltd., the Company plans to continue scaling down legacy operations and selling the remaining Unyvero assets in inventory with the intention of exiting the Unyvero business. Going forward, the Company is planning to reposition itself and will launch a new business in the financial technology industry supporting digital investment banking activities. The Company also contemplates engaging in the provision of listing consultancy services to international companies seeking to list their securities on securities exchanges. 

The Company s headquarters and principal operations were located at 9717 Key West Avenue, Suite 100, in Rockville, Maryland, through the end of the first quarter of 2024. Upon assignment of the Company s lease, the Company operates virtually. The Company operates in one business segment. 

million and million in 2023 and 2024, respectively. 

Although the Company only has cash and cash equivalents of 1.6 million as of September 30, 2024, in August 2024, the Company and AEI Capital Ltd. entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the August 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement ), pursuant to which the Company has the right, in its discretion, to sell to AEI Capital Ltd. shares of common stock having an aggregate value of up to 3.0 million. The purchase price for any shares sold under the August 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement is the closing sales price on the Nasdaq Capital Market of the Company s common stock as of the date immediately prior to the date of sale. In addition, in October 2024, the Company and AEI Capital Ltd. entered into a First Amendment (the Amendment to the August 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement. The Amendment amended the August 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement by: (1) granting the Company the right to sell two additional tranches of common stock to AEI Capital Ltd. of 3.0 million each, for an aggregate amount of million under the Purchase Agreement; and (2) extending the Company s ability to sell shares of common stock to AEI Capital Ltd. under the Purchase Agreement until December 31, 2025. As of September 30, 2024, the Company sold shares of common stock to AEI Capital Ltd. for gross proceeds of million before deducting offering expenses. Accordingly, the Company has the right, in its discretion, to sell to AEI Capital Ltd., at any time prior to December 31, 2025, shares of common stock, par value per share (the Shares ), of the Company having an aggregate value of up to an additional million. As a result, the Company believes that its current cash and its access to additional cash under the August 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement will allow the Company to fund operations in excess of 12 months from the issuance date of these financial statements. 

On June 5, 2024, the Company received a letter from the listing staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq that the Company was no longer in compliance with the minimum stockholders equity requirement for continued listing on Nasdaq pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (the Stockholders Equity Rule ). The Stockholders Equity Rule requires companies listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market to maintain stockholders equity of at least ,000 or to meet alternatives of market value of listed securities or net income from continuing operations, which the Company does not currently meet. In response to the letter, the Company submitted its plan to regain compliance with the Stockholders Equity Rule to the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the Panel and requested additional time to regain compliance with such rule. On August 16, 2024, following the Panel s review of the Company s plan to regain compliance, the Company received a letter (the Notice indicating that the Panel had determined to deny the Company s request for continued listing on Nasdaq. Pursuant to the Notice, based on the preliminary nature of the Company s plan, the Panel determined that the Company did not provide a definitive plan evidencing its ability to achieve near- and long-term compliance with the Stockholders Equity Requirement. The Notice also provided that the Company s securities will be suspended from trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market at the opening of business on August 20, 2024. The Company submitted its appeal regarding the Panel s determination on September 13, 2024 and requested that the Nasdaq Listing and Hearing Review Council review the decision of the Panel. Such appeal stayed the delisting of the Company s securities with Nasdaq and the filing of the Form 25 pending the Nasdaq Listing and Hearing Review Council s decision until the resolution of such review. There can be no assurance that the Nasdaq Listing and Hearing Review Council will grant the Company s request for continued listing on Nasdaq.

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company identified an immaterial error related to the inclusion of balances of accumulated other comprehensive loss representing historic translation adjustments of previously dissolved subsidiaries that impacted the Company s previously issued 2023 and 2022 consolidated financial statements. Management evaluated the effect of the error on the 2023, 2022, and current period consolidated financial statements and concluded the error was not material. As a result, in the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company recorded an out of period adjustment to increase the loss on deconsolidation of subsidiaries and decrease accumulated other comprehensive loss, each by approximately thousand.

Inventory is entirely made up of Unyvero system instruments and components. 

The Company periodically reviews inventory quantities on hand and analyzes the provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on product expiration dating and its estimated sales forecast, which is based on sales history and anticipated future demand. The Company s estimates of future product demand may not be accurate, and it may understate or overstate the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. Accordingly, any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of the Company s inventory and results of operations. Based on the Company s assumptions and estimates, inventory reserves for obsolescence, expirations, and slow-moving inventory were and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Due to the insolvency proceedings and deconsolidation of the Company s subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company reserved for the full value of its inventory at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 given the uncertainty surrounding the net realizable value and future demand for the Company s products. 

Leases 

The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. For leases where the Company is the lessee, right-of-use ROU assets represent the Company s right to use the underlying asset for the term of the lease and the lease liabilities represent an obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the future lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date of the underlying lease arrangement to determine the present value of lease payments. The ROU asset also includes any prepaid lease payments and any lease incentives received. The lease term to calculate the ROU asset and related lease liability includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. The Company s lease agreements generally do not contain any material variable lease payments, residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants. 

Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as an operating expense while expense for financing leases is recognized as depreciation expense and interest expense using the effective interest method of recognition. The Company has made certain accounting policy elections whereby the Company (i) does not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities for short-term leases (those with original terms of 12 months or less) and (ii) combines lease and non-lease elements of our operating leases. 

ROU assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used are measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Recoverability measurement and estimating of undiscounted cash flows is done at the lowest possible level for which the Company can identify assets. If such assets are considered to be impaired, impairment is recognized as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. The Company did t identify any impaired ROU assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Intangible assets 

Intangible assets consist of finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets. 

Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If any indicators were present, the Company would test for recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the asset. If those net undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying amount (i.e., the asset is not recoverable), the Company would perform the next step, which is to determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment loss, if any. All the Company s finite-lived intangible assets with net balances were held by Curetis and Ares Genetics. As a result of the insolvency filings for Curetis and Ares Genetics and the associated deconsolidation of all balance sheet balances related to these entities in 2023, the Company does not have any finite-lived or indefinite-lived intangible asset balances as of September 30, 2024. 

Total amortization expense of intangible assets was and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Due to the removal of the intangible assets of Curetis and Ares Genetics in 2023 and the Company s absence of intangible assets as of September 30, 2024, the Company does not currently anticipate any future amortization of intangible assets.

likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority, assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. 

The Company had federal net operating loss NOL carryforwards of and at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Despite the NOL carryforwards, which started expiring in 2022, the Company may have state tax requirements. Also, use of the NOL carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation as provided by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). To date, the Company has not performed a formal study to determine if any of its remaining NOL and credit attributes might be further limited due to the ownership change rules of Section 382 or Section 383 of the Code. The Company will continue to monitor this matter going forward. There can be no assurance that the NOL carryforwards will ever be fully utilized.

In 2016, Curetis entered into a contract for an up to million senior, unsecured loan financing facility from the EIB (see Note 6). In June 2019, Curetis drew down a third tranche of million from the EIB. In return for the EIB waiving the condition precedent of minimum cumulative equity capital raised of million to disburse this million tranche, the parties agreed on a participation percentage interest PPI ). Upon maturity of the tranche, the EIB would be entitled to an additional payment that is equity-linked and equivalent to of the then total valuation of Curetis N.V. On July 9, 2020, the Company negotiated an amendment to the EIB debt financing facility. As part of the amendment, the parties adjusted the PPI percentage applicable to the previous EIB tranche of million which was funded in June 2019 from its original PPI in Curetis N.V. s equity value upon maturity to a new PPI in OpGen s equity. In May 2022, upon maturity. This right constituted an embedded derivative, which is separated and measured at fair value with changes being accounted for through profit or loss. The Company determines the fair value of the derivative using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Using this model, level 3 unobservable inputs include estimated discount rates and estimated risk-free interest rates. 

Following Curetis insolvency filing, in November 2023, Curetis received a termination notice from the EIB terminating the Standstill Agreement, pursuant to which the EIB had agreed that the EIB would not take any action or exercise any right with respect to an event of default under the Finance Contract, effective as of November 20, 2023. In December 2023, the Company received a notice from the EIB stating that Curetis was in default of the Finance Contract as a result of, among other things, Curetis failure to repay when due certain outstanding indebtedness under the Finance Contract. Pursuant to that certain Guarantee and Indemnity Agreement, dated July 9, 2020, between the EIB and the Company, the EIB demanded that the Company, as guarantor, immediately repay the EIB all amounts owed to the EIB under the Finance Contract and reserved all its other rights and remedies in connection with the Finance Contract. The Company determined the fair value of the PPI using the Monte Carlo simulation model as of August 19, 2024, the date in which the Company paid and settled its outstanding indebtedness with the EIB. Upon settlement of such indebtedness, the Company recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of approximately million, which represents the excess of the fair value of the outstanding principal, accumulated and deferred interest, and the PPI over the settlement amount.

EIB Loan Facility 

In 2016, Curetis entered into a contract for an up to million senior, unsecured loan financing facility from the EIB. The funding could be drawn in up to five tranches within months of entry into the contract, and each tranche was to be repaid upon maturity five years after draw-down. 

In April 2017, Curetis drew down a first tranche of million from this facility. This tranche had a floating interest rate of EURIBOR plus payable after each 12-month-period from the draw-down-date and another additional interest per annum that was deferred and payable at maturity together with the principal. In June 2018, a second tranche of million was drawn down. The terms and conditions were analogous to the first one. In June 2019, Curetis drew down a third tranche of million from the EIB. In line with all prior tranches, the majority of interest was also deferred until repayment upon maturity. In return for the EIB waiving the condition precedent of minimum cumulative equity capital raised of million to disburse this million third tranche, the parties agreed on a PPI. Upon maturity of the tranche, the EIB would be entitled to an additional payment that was equity-linked and equivalent to of the then total valuation of Curetis N.V. As part of an amendment between the Company and the EIB on July 9, 2020, the parties adjusted the PPI percentage applicable to the third EIB tranche of million, which was funded in June 2019, from its original 2.1 PPI in Curetis N.V. s equity value upon maturity to a new PPI in OpGen s equity value upon maturity. This right constituted an embedded derivative, which was separated and measured at fair value with changes being accounted for through income or loss. The EIB debt was measured and recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. The fair value of the EIB debt was approximately 14.4 million (approximately million) as of the acquisition date. The resulting debt discount was to be amortized over the life of the EIB debt as an increase to interest expense. 

In May 2022, the Company and the EIB entered into a Waiver and Amendment Letter (the 2022 EIB Amendment relating to the amendment of the EIB loan facility, between the EIB and Curetis, pursuant to which Curetis borrowed an aggregate amount of million in three tranches. The 2022 EIB Amendment restructured the first tranche of approximately million (including accumulated and deferred interest) of the Company s outstanding indebtedness with the EIB. Pursuant to the 2022 EIB Amendment, the Company repaid million to the EIB in April 2022. The Company also agreed, among other things, to amortize the remainder of the debt tranche over the twelve-month period beginning in May 2022. Accordingly, the Company agreed to pay a monthly amount of approximately million through April 2023. The 2022 EIB Amendment also provided for an increase of the PPI applicable to the third tranche under the loan facility from to . The terms of the second and third tranches of the Company s indebtedness of million and million, respectively, plus accumulated deferred interest, remained unchanged pursuant to the 2022 EIB Amendment. The second tranche became due and payable by the Company to the EIB in June 2023, and the third tranche would have become due and payable in June 2024. As the effective borrowing rate under the amended agreement was less than the effective borrowing rate under the previous agreement, a concession is deemed to have been granted under ASC 470-60. As a concession was granted, the agreement was accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring under ASC 470-60. The amendment did not result in a gain on restructuring as the future undiscounted cash outflows required under the amended agreement exceeded the carrying value of the debt immediately prior to the amendment. 

In June 2023, the Company announced that its subsidiary Curetis and the European Investment Bank EIB agreed in principle to certain terms relating to the repayment of the second tranche of Curetis loan from the EIB pursuant to that certain Finance Contract, dated December 12, 2016, as amended, by and between Curetis and the EIB (the Finance Contract ). The second tranche had a principal balance of million plus accumulated and deferred interest. The second tranche was drawn down in June 2018 and matured in June 2023. In July 2023, the EIB and Curetis entered into a Standstill Agreement pursuant to which the EIB agreed that, with respect to each default or event of default relating to such second tranche, the EIB would not take any action or exercise any right under the Finance Contract until the earlier of a restructuring of the second tranche and November 30, 2023. As a condition to entering into the Standstill Agreement, Curetis paid the EIB a partial payment of interest on the second tranche of million in June 2023. In addition, Curetis agreed to certain undertakings during the standstill period, including the delivery of a rolling cash flow forecast and to cause a third-party restructuring expert to prepare and deliver a restructuring opinion to the EIB. EIB could terminate the Standstill Agreement upon notice to Curetis if, among other customary termination rights, Curetis or the guarantors failed to comply with any undertakings in the Standstill Agreement, the third party expert determined that there were no prospects for a successful restructuring of the second tranche and that it therefore will be unable to issue a restructuring opinion, or the cash flow forecast showed a negative liquidity shortfall during the specified period. 

In November 2023, Curetis received a termination notice from the EIB terminating the Standstill Agreement effective as of November 20, 2023. The EIB s termination notice stated that the termination of the Standstill Agreement was as a result of and in connection with certain defaults of the Standstill Agreement arising from, among other related reasons, Curetis and Ares entry into insolvency proceedings. In December 2023, the Company received a notice from the EIB stating that Curetis was in default of the Finance Contract as a result of, among other things, Curetis failure to repay when due certain outstanding indebtedness under the Finance Contract. In its notice, the EIB stated that, as of November 16, 2023, the aggregate amount of principal, accrued interest and all other amounts owed by Curetis to the EIB under the Finance Contract was approximately 9.66 million and that interest will continue to accrue in accordance with the Finance Contract until all amounts owed are paid in full. Pursuant to that certain Guarantee and Indemnity Agreement, dated July 9, 2020 (the Guaranty ), between the EIB and the Company, the EIB demanded that the Company, as guarantor, immediately repay the EIB all amounts owed to the EIB under the Finance Contract and reserved all of its other rights and remedies in connection with the Finance Contract. 

In connection with the Company s entry into the March 2024 Purchase Agreement with David E. Lazar in March 2024, the Company entered into settlement agreements with each of the EIB and Curetis and Curetis trustee in insolvency, pursuant to which the Company agreed to pay a total of 2.0 million to settle all outstanding debt and liabilities of the Company to EIB and Curetis. The settlement agreement with EIB also provided for the termination of that certain Guarantee and Indemnity Agreement, dated as of July 9, 2020, by and between the EIB and the Company, pursuant to which the Company had guaranteed all of Curetis debt to EIB. On August 19, 2024, the Company paid and settled its outstanding indebtedness with the EIB and Curetis, which terminated the Guarantee and Indemnity Agreement. Accordingly, upon termination of such Guarantee and Indemnity Agreement, the Company recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt in excess of million. 

Total interest expense (including amortization of debt discounts and financing fees) on all debt instruments was and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Total interest expense (including amortization of debt discounts and financing fees) on all debt instruments was and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Upon deconsolidation of the Company s subsidiaries in 2023, the Company reclassified the EIB liability from a loan to a loan guaranty which is recorded based on its fair value with changes being recognized as part of net income at each reporting date. 

In May 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to finance a portion of the premium for its Directors and Officers Insurance. The agreement provides for financing of of the premium, repayments in 10 equal monthly installments of each through March 2025 and accrued interest at .

Following receipt of approval from stockholders at a special meeting of stockholders held in November 2022, the Company filed an amendment to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, at a ratio of one share for twenty shares, and the reverse stock split was effective January 5, 2023. All share amounts and per share prices in this Quarterly Report have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split. 

Following receipt of approval from stockholders at a special meeting of stockholders held in May 2024, the Company filed an amendment to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, at a ratio of one share for ten shares, and the reverse stock split was effective May 20, 2024. All share amounts and per share prices in this Quarterly Report have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split. 

In January 2023, the Company closed a best-efforts public offering pursuant to a securities purchase agreement with a certain institutional investor for the purchase of (i) 32,121 shares of the Company s common stock, par value 0.01 per share, (ii) pre-funded warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of shares of common stock, (iii) Series A-1 common warrants to purchase an aggregate of shares of common stock, and (iv) Series A-2 common warrants to purchase an aggregate of shares of common stock. Each share of common stock and accompanying Series A-1 and Series A-2 common warrant were sold at a price of per share and accompanying Series A-1 and Series A-2 common warrant, and each pre-funded warrant and accompanying Series A-1 and Series A-2 common warrant were sold at an offering price of per share underlying such pre-funded warrant and accompanying Series A-1 and Series A-2 common warrant, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately million before deducting the placement agent s fees and the offering expenses, and net proceeds of approximately million. The Series A-1 and Series A-2 common warrants have an exercise price of per share. The Series A-1 common warrants were immediately exercisable upon issuance and will expire five years following the issuance date. The Series A-2 common warrants were immediately exercisable upon issuance and will expire eighteen months following the issuance date. Subject to certain ownership limitations described in the pre-funded warrants, the pre-funded warrants were immediately exercisable and could be exercised at a nominal consideration of per share of common stock any time until all the pre-funded warrants are exercised in full. All pre-funded warrants were exercised by February 2023. In connection with the Company s best-efforts public offering consummated in May 2023, the Company amended the exercise price of the Series A-1 and Series A-2 common warrants to per share. 

In May 2023, the Company closed a best-efforts public offering pursuant to a securities purchase agreement with a certain institutional investor, pursuant to which the Company issued and sold to the investor (i) shares of the Company s common stock, par value per share, (ii) pre-funded warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of shares of common stock, and (iii) common warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of shares of common stock. Each share of common stock and accompanying common warrant was sold at a price of per share and accompanying common warrant, and each pre-funded warrant and accompanying common warrant was sold at an offering price of per share underlying such pre-funded warrant and accompanying common warrant, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately million and net proceeds of approximately million. The common warrants have an exercise price of per share and will be exercisable beginning on the date of stockholder approval of the exercisability of the warrants under Nasdaq rules or may be exercised through October 26, 2023, pursuant to the Warrant Inducement Agreement entered into on October 12, 2023. Pursuant to amendment agreements entered into by the Company and holder on October 26, 2023 and February 7, 2024, the Company agreed to initially extend the offer period until December 31, 2023, and subsequently extend the offer period until April 30, 2024. In order to permit the exercise of the Existing Warrants pursuant to the rules of the Nasdaq Capital Market, the holder agreed to pay as additional consideration per share of common stock issued upon exercise of the Existing Warrants. The common warrants not exercised as part of the Inducement Agreement will expire on the five-year anniversary of the date of such stockholder approval. Each pre-funded warrant has an exercise price per share of common stock equal to per share and may be exercised at any time until the pre-funded warrants are exercised in full. In connection with the offering, the Company also entered into a warrant amendment agreement with the investor pursuant to which the Company amended certain existing warrants to purchase up to shares of common stock that were previously issued in 2018, 2021, 2022 and 2023 to the investor, with exercise prices ranging from to per share, in consideration for their purchase of the securities in the offering, as follows: (i) lower the exercise price of the existing warrants to 7.785 per share, (ii) provide that the existing warrants, as amended, will not be exercisable until the receipt of stockholder approval for the exercisability of the common warrants in the offering, and (iii) extend the original expiration date of the existing warrants by five years following the receipt of such stockholder approval. The increase in fair value resulting from the warrant modifications is accounted for as an equity issuance cost, resulting in a debit and credit to additional paid in capital of approximately million. In October 2023 , the holder exercised shares of Common Stock under the existing warrants pursuant to the Inducement Agreement for aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of million before deducting financial advisory fees and other expenses payable by the Company. The holder did not exercise any additional Existing Warrants prior to the termination of the April 30, 2024 extended offer period. Except for the extension of the offer period pursuant to the amendment agreements, the terms and conditions of the Inducement Agreement remained unchanged. 

In

a single investor, pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell to the investor in a private placement (the Private
Placement 
shares of the Company s Series D Preferred Stock, par value 
per share (the Preferred Stock ). Each share of preferred stock was agreed to sell at a price of 
per share for expected aggregate gross proceeds of 1.0 million before deducting offering expenses. The Private Placement was
conducted in connection with the negotiation of a potential strategic transaction involving the Company and the investor. The
Company intended to use the proceeds from the Private Placement to fund the Company s operations while it pursued a potential
strategic transaction with the investor. Pursuant to the October 2023 Purchase Agreement, the Company filed a certificate of
designation (the Series D Certificate of Designation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware designating
the rights, preferences and limitations of the shares of preferred stock in October 2023. The Series D Certificate of
Designation provides that the shares of preferred stock have a stated value of 1,000 per share and are convertible into shares of
common stock, par value 
per share of the Company at a price of 
per share, subject to adjustment in the event of certain stock dividends and distributions, stock splits, stock combinations,
reclassifications, or similar events affecting the common stock. The preferred stock may be converted at any time at the option of
the holder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Series D Certificate of Designation provides that in no event will the preferred
stock be convertible into common stock in a manner that would result in the holder, its permitted transferees and affiliates holding
more than 
(together with any shares of common stock otherwise held by the investor, its permitted transferees and their affiliates) of the
then issued and outstanding common stock (the Ownership Limitation ), prior to the date that the Company s
stockholders approve the issuance of shares of common stock to the holder upon conversion of the preferred stock (the
 stockholder approval ). Upon receipt of stockholder approval, the shares of preferred stock will automatically be
converted into shares of common stock without further action of the holder thereof. The investor funded 
of the expected aggregate gross proceeds of 1.0 million before deducting offering expenses in November 2023. In
December 2023, in coordination with the investor, the Company issued 250 shares of Series D Preferred Stock to the investor in
consideration for the partial payment. As of September 30, 2024, all 250 Series D Preferred Shares remain outstanding and the
remaining of the purchase price remains unpaid. The Company reserves all rights and remedies arising from the
investor s failure to close the transaction and the investor will continue to be in breach of the Purchase Agreement until the
remaining amount is paid in full. 

In
October 2023, the Company entered into a warrant inducement agreement (the Inducement Agreement with a holder (the
 Holder of certain existing warrants (the Existing Warrants to purchase shares of common stock, par value
 0.01 per share, of the Company. Pursuant to the Inducement Agreement, the Holder agreed to exercise for cash their Existing Warrants

new warrants (the Inducement Warrants to purchase shares of common stock equal to of the number of shares of common
stock issued upon exercise of the Existing Warrants (the Inducement Warrant Shares ). The Inducement Warrants will have
an exercise price of 3.36 per share and will be exercisable on the six-month anniversary of the date of issuance and expire on the five-year
anniversary of the Inducement Warrant s first becoming exercisable. In October 2023 ,
the Holder exercised 200,000 shares of Common Stock under the existing warrants pursuant to the Inducement Agreement for aggregate gross
proceeds to the Company of 2.057 million before deducting financial advisory fees and other expenses payable by the Company. The Holder

Item 2.
Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The
following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with
the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included in Part I, Item 1 of this
quarterly report on Form 10-Q. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, based on current expectations and related to
future events and our future financial performance, that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from
those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many important factors, including those set forth under Part II.
Item 1A. Risk Factors of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q and Part 1. Item 1A of our annual report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Overview 

OpGen,
Inc. OpGen or the Company was incorporated in Delaware in 2001. In April 2020, OpGen completed a business
combination transaction with Curetis N.V., a public company with limited liability under the laws of the Netherlands, pursuant to which
the Company acquired all the shares of Curetis GmbH, a private limited liability company organized under the laws of the Federal Republic
of Germany Curetis GmbH ), and certain other assets and liabilities of Curetis N.V., including Ares Genetics GmbH Ares
Genetics ), a wholly owned subsidiary of Curetis GmbH (together, Curetis ). 

From
inception until November 2023, OpGen operated as a precision medicine company harnessing the power of molecular diagnostics and
informatics to help combat infectious disease. The Company, along with its subsidiaries, Curetis and Ares Genetics, developed and commercialized
molecular microbiology solutions helping to guide clinicians with more rapid and actionable information about life threatening infections
to improve patient outcomes and decrease the spread of infections caused by multidrug-resistant microorganisms, or MDROs. In November 2023,
Curetis filed a petition for insolvency with the district court of Stuttgart, Germany, and Ares Genetics filed a petition for insolvency
with the commercial court in Vienna, Austria. The insolvency proceedings of Curetis and Ares Genetics were adjudicated under the insolvency
laws of Germany and Austria, respectively. 

The
insolvency administrators assumed control over the assets and liabilities of Curetis and Ares Genetics, respectively, which eliminated
the authority and power of the Company and its officers to act on behalf of the subsidiaries. The loss of control required that the Company
no longer include Curetis and Ares Genetics in its consolidated financial statements. Prior to the insolvency filings, Curetis and Ares
Genetics had been included in the Company s consolidated financial statements. As part of the insolvency proceedings, in April 2024,
the insolvency administrator for Curetis notified the Company that all of Curetis assets were sold to Camtech Pte Ltd., a Singaporean
family office Camtech . In April 2024, the insolvency administrator
for Ares Genetics notified the Company that all of Ares Genetics assets were sold to bioMerieux S.A. 

In
March 2024, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the March 2024 Purchase Agreement with
David E. Lazar, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell 3,000,000 shares of Series E Convertible Preferred Stock Series
E Preferred Stock to Mr. Lazar at a price of 1.00 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of 3.0 million. In connection with
the transactions contemplated by the March 2024 Purchase Agreement, the members of the Board of Directors, prior to the closing
of such transactions, resigned and a new Board of Directors was appointed, of which Mr. Lazar was appointed Chairman. Furthermore, in
April 2024, the Company entered into an employment agreement with David E. Lazar, pursuant to which the Company engaged Mr. Lazar
to act as its Chief Executive Officer CEO ). 

28 

In April
2024, the Company entered into a lease assignment agreement where the Company assigned the lease of its Rockville, Maryland headquarters
to a third party. The Company s security deposit remains with the landlord and will be repaid over time as agreed upon with the
third party assignee. The Company has a continuing liability under the lease; however, within the lease assignment agreement, the new
tenant indemnifies the Company from and against any liabilities resulting from obligations arising on or after the lease assignment date. 

In July 2024, Mr. Lazar
consummated a transaction pursuant to which he sold 550,000 shares of Series E Preferred Stock together with his rights to purchase the
additional 2,450,000 shares of Series E Preferred Stock under the March 2024 Purchase Agreement to AEI Capital Ltd. Subsequently, AEI
Capital Ltd. paid the Company 2.45 million in August 2024 in exchange for the remaining 2,450,000 shares of Series E Preferred Stock
under the terms of the March 2024 Purchase Agreement. All 3,000,000 shares of Series E Preferred Stock were converted into 7,200,000 shares
of the Company s common stock in August 2024. As of September 30, 2024, no shares of Series E Preferred Stock remain outstanding.
Upon conversion, such shares of Series E Preferred Stock resumed the status of authorized but unissued shares of undesignated preferred
stock of the Company. 

Under
the ownership of AEI Capital Ltd., the Company plans to continue scaling down legacy operations and selling the remaining Unyvero assets
in inventory with the intention of exiting the Unyvero business. Going forward, the Company is planning to reposition itself and will
launch a new business in the financial technology industry supporting digital investment banking activities. The Company also contemplates
engaging in the provision of listing consultancy services to international companies seeking to list their securities on securities exchanges. 

In November 2022, the Company filed an amendment
to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to effect a one-for-twenty reverse stock split of the issued and outstanding
shares of common stock on January 5, 2023. In addition, in May 2024, the Company filed an amendment to its Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation to effect a one-for-ten reverse stock split of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock on May 20, 2024. All
share amounts and per share prices in this Quarterly Report have been adjusted to reflect such reverse stock splits. 

The
Company s headquarters were located at 9717 Key West Avenue, Suite 100, in Rockville, Maryland, through the end of the first quarter
of 2024. Upon assignment of the Company s lease, the Company operates virtually. The Company operates in one business segment. 

Financial
Overview 

Revenue 

We recognize three types of
revenues: product sales, laboratory services and collaboration revenue. Prior to the repositioning of our business in July 2024, we generated
product revenues from sales of our products, including through our distribution partners, such as our Unyvero instruments and consumables.
We also generated revenue from sales by Ares Genetics of its AI-powered prediction models and solutions. Revenues generated from our laboratory
services related to services that we and our subsidiaries provided to customers. Lastly, our collaboration revenues consisted of revenue
received from research and development collaborations that we entered into with third parties, such as our collaboration agreement with
FIND. 

29 

Cost
of Products, Cost of Services, and Operating Expenses 

Our cost of products consist
of product and inventory costs, including materials costs and overhead, and other costs related to the recognition of revenue. Cost of
services relate to the material and labor costs associated with providing our services. Research and development expenses consisted primarily
of expenses incurred in connection with our clinical and pre-clinical research activities. Selling, general and administrative expenses
consist of public company costs, salaries, and related costs for administrative, sales, and business development personnel.

Total revenue for the three months ended September
30, 2024 decreased 100 when compared to the same period in 2023 since we did not generate any revenue during the three months ended September
30, 2024. This decrease is primarily attributable to: 

Product
Sales: the decrease of 100 in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period is attributable to the exclusion of Curetis and Ares
Genetics product sales in the 2024 period following their insolvency filings in November 2023 and the resulting deconsolidation
of the subsidiaries as well as the scaling down of legacy operations at the Company in connection with the Company repositioning its
business; 

Laboratory
 Services: the decrease of 100 in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period is attributable
 to t he discontinuance of Ares Genetics 
 related products and services during the first quarter of 2024 due to the sale of the Ares
 Genetics assets to a strategic acquiror by its insolvency administrator in Austria; and 

Collaboration
 Revenue: the decrease of 100 in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period is due to the
 Company no longer receiving revenues under the collaboration agreement with FIND as a result
 of the deconsolidation following Curetis insolvency filing in 2023.

Our
total operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased approximately 82 when compared to the same period
in 2023. Operating expenses changed as follows: 

Cost
 of products sold: cost of products sold for the three months ended September 30, 2024
 decreased 100 when compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in cost of products
 sold aligns with the decrease in product sales during such three-month period of 2024. In
 addition, cost of products sold was greater in the third quarter of 2023 due to increases
 in inventory reserves for obsolescence, expirations,
 and slow-moving inventory , whereas in the third quarter of 2024, all inventory had
 already been fully reserved ; 

Cost
 of services: cost of services for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 100 when compared to the same period in
 2023. The decrease in cost of services aligns with the decrease in laboratory services and collaboration revenue during such
 three-month period of 2024, which is due to the sale of Ares Genetics business in the first quarter of 2024 as part of Ares
 Genetics insolvency proceedings and the Company no longer incurring expenses under the collaboration agreement with FIND as a
 result of the deconsolidation following Ares Genetics and Curetis insolvency filings in 2023; and 

Research
 and development, general and administrative, and sales and marketing: research and development,
 general and administrative, and sales and marketing expenses decreased approximately 100 ,
 62 , and 96 , respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to
 the same period in 2023. The decreases are primarily attributable to the Company no longer
 including expenses related to Curetis and Ares Genetics in the consolidated figures as a
 result of the deconsolidation following their insolvency filings in November 2023, and
 the scaling down of legacy operations at the Company in connection with the Company repositioning its business.

the Company s settlement of the EIB loan guaranty in August 2024 and the Company recognizing a gain on settlement of compensation
expenses following the Company s settlement of deferred and accrued compensation and severance expenses with the Company s
former CEO, David E. Lazar.

Total
revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased approximately 92 when compared to the same period in 2023. This
decrease is primarily attributable to: 

Product
 Sales: the decrease of approximately 88 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 is
 primarily attributable to the exclusion of Curetis and Ares Genetics product sales in the 2024 period following their
 insolvency filings in November 2023 and the resulting deconsolidation of the subsidiaries as well as the scaling down of legacy
 operations at the Company in connection with the Company repositioning its business; 

Laboratory
 Services: the decrease of approximately 76 during the nine months ended September 30,
 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 is primarily attributable to t he
 discontinuance of Ares Genetics related products and services during the first quarter
 of 2024 due to the sale of the Ares Genetics assets to a strategic acquiror by its insolvency
 administrator in Austria; and 

Collaboration
 Revenue: the decrease of 100 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared
 to the same period in 2023 is due to the Company no longer receiving revenues under the collaboration
 agreement with FIND as a result of the deconsolidation following Curetis insolvency
 filing in 2023.

in 2023. Operating expenses changed as follows: 

Cost
 of products sold: cost of products sold for the nine months ended September 30, 2024
 decreased approximately 98 when compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in cost
 of products sold aligns with the decrease in product sales for the same period in 2024. Additionally,
 cost of products sold was greater in the first nine months of 2023 due to increases in inventory
 reserves for obsolescence, expirations, and slow-moving
 inventory , whereas in the first nine months of 2024, all inventory had already been
 fully reserved ; 

32 

Cost
 of services: cost of services for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased approximately 100 when compared to the
 same period in 2023. The decrease in cost of services aligns with the decrease in laboratory services and collaboration revenue in
 the same period in 2024, which is due to the sale of Ares Genetics business in the first quarter of 2024 as part of Ares
 Genetics insolvency proceedings and the Company no longer being a party to the collaboration agreement with FIND as a result
 of the deconsolidation following Ares Genetics and Curetis insolvency filings in 2023; and 

Research
 and development, general and administrative, and sales and marketing: research and development,
 general and administrative, and sales and marketing expenses decreased approximately 99 ,
 42 , and 93 , respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to
 the same period in 2023. The decreases are primarily attributable to the Company no longer
 including expenses related to Curetis and Ares Genetics in the consolidated figures as a
 result of the deconsolidation following their insolvency filings in November 2023, plus
 the scaling down of legacy operations at the Company in connection with the Company repositioning its business.

Our
total other income (expense) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased to a net income of 11.7 million from a net
expense of 1.8 million in the same period in 2023 primarily due to the Company recognizing a gain on extinguishment of debt following
the Company s settlement of the EIB loan guaranty in August 2024, the Company recognizing a gain on settlement of compensation
expenses following the Company s settlement of deferred and accrued compensation and severance expenses with the Company s
former CEO, David E. Lazar, and the Company recording a gain on impairment adjustment of 2.1 million. In addition, the Company did not
recognize interest expense on the Company s EIB liability for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 because, upon deconsolidation
of the Company s subsidiaries in the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company reclassified the EIB liability from a loan to a loan guaranty,
which is recorded based on its fair value with changes being recognized as part of net income (loss) at each reporting date. 

Liquidity
and capital resources 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 1.6 million compared to 1.2 million at December 31, 2023. Historically,
we have funded our operations primarily through external investor financing arrangements and have raised funds in 2024 and 2023, including: 

In
 January 2023, we closed a best-efforts public offering for the purchase of (i) 32,121
 shares of common stock, (ii) pre-funded warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 226,500
 shares of common stock, (iii) Series A-1 common warrants to purchase an aggregate of 258,621
 shares of common stock, and (iv) Series A-2 common warrants to purchase an aggregate of 258,621
 shares of common stock. The offering raised aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 7.5
 million before deducting the placement agent s fees and the offering expenses, and
 net proceeds of approximately 6.9 million. 

33 

In
 May 2023, we closed a best-efforts public offering for the purchase of (i) 60,500 shares
 of the Company s common stock, par value 0.01 per share, (ii) pre-funded warrants
 to purchase up to an aggregate of 389,083 shares of common stock, and (iii) common warrants
 to purchase up to an aggregate of 449,583 shares of common stock. The offering raised aggregate
 gross proceeds of approximately 3.5 million and net proceeds of approximately 3.0 million. 

In
 October 2023, Curetis received a payment of 0.75 million related to the sale of
 certain Unyvero A50 systems by Curetis to a strategic partner. Such purchase of systems and
 payment was made in connection with the negotiation of a potential strategic transaction
 involving Curetis and the Company s subsidiary, Ares Genetics, with such strategic
 partner; however, the potential strategic transaction was unsuccessful. 

In
 October 2023, we entered into a Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement with a single investor
 for 1,000 shares of the Company s Series D Preferred Stock, par value 0.01 per share,
 where each share of preferred stock was agreed to sell at a price of 1,000 per share for
 aggregate gross proceeds of 1.0 million before deducting offering expenses. The investor
 funded 250,000 of the expected aggregate gross proceeds of 1.0 million before deducting
 offering expenses in November 2023. In December 2023, in coordination with the
 investor, the Company issued 250 shares of Series D Preferred Stock to the investor in consideration
 for the partial payment. As of September 30, 2024, all 250 Series D Preferred Shares
 remain outstanding and the remaining 750,000 of the purchase price remains unpaid. The private
 placement was conducted in connection with the negotiation of a potential strategic transaction
 involving the Company and the investor. The Company s discussions with this investor
 have ceased. 

In
 October 2023, we entered into a warrant inducement agreement with a holder of certain
 existing warrants to purchase shares of common stock, par value 0.01 per share, of the Company.
 Pursuant to the Inducement Agreement, the holder agreed to exercise for cash their existing
 warrants to purchase up to 1,089,274 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise
 price of 7.785 per share, the exercise price per share of the existing warrants, during
 the period from the date of the Inducement Agreement until 7:30 a.m., Eastern Time, on October 26,
 2023; however, on October 26, 2023, and subsequently on February 7, 2024, the Company
 and the holder agreed to initially extend the offer period through December 31, 2023,
 and later through April 30, 2024. In October 2023, the Holder exercised 200,000
 shares of Common Stock under the existing warrants pursuant to the Inducement Agreement for
 aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of 2.057 million before deducting financial advisory
 fees and other expenses payable by the Company. The Holder did not exercise any additional
 Existing Warrants prior to the termination of the April 30, 2024 extended offer period. 

In
 November 2023, Curetis filed a petition for insolvency with the district court of Stuttgart,
 Germany, and Ares Genetics filed a petition for insolvency with the commercial court in Vienna,
 Austria, Reference Number 38 S 175/23x. The insolvency proceedings of Curetis and Ares Genetics
 were adjudicated under the insolvency laws of Germany and Austria, respectively. The insolvency
 administrators assumed control over the assets and liabilities of Curetis and Ares Genetics,
 respectively, which eliminated the authority and power of the Company and its officers to
 act on behalf of the subsidiaries. The German and Austrian insolvency administrators both
 successfully completed asset sales of the assets of Curetis and Ares Genetics, but the Company
 does not anticipate receiving any proceeds from such sales as the proceeds will be allocated
 amongst each entity s creditors. 

In
 March 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with David E. Lazar, pursuant
 to which we agreed to sell 3,000,000 shares of Series E Convertible Preferred Stock to Mr.
 Lazar at a price of 1.00 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of 3.0 million. In March 2024,
 Mr. Lazar paid 200,000 at the initial closing in exchange for 200,000 shares of Series E
 Preferred Stock. Mr. Lazar subsequently paid 350,000 in exchange for an additional 350,000
 shares of Series E Preferred Stock in April 2024. In July 2024, Mr. Lazar consummated a transaction pursuant to which he sold 550,000 shares of Series E Preferred Stock together with
his rights to purchase the additional 2,450,000 shares of Series E Preferred Stock under the March 2024 Purchase Agreement to AEI
Capital Ltd. Subsequently, AEI Capital Ltd. paid the Company 2.45 million in August 2024 in exchange for the remaining 2,450,000
shares of Series E Preferred Stock under the terms of the March 2024 Purchase Agreement. 

34 

In
August 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the August 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement with AEI Capital
Ltd., pursuant to which we have the right, in our discretion, to sell to AEI Capital Ltd., at any time prior to September 30, 2024, shares
of common stock, par value 0.01 per share, of the Company having an aggregate value of up to 3.0 million. As of September 30, 2024,
the Company sold 1,079,109 shares of common stock to AEI Capital Ltd. for gross proceeds of 2.0 million before deducting offering expenses.
In October 2024, we entered into a First Amendment (the Amendment to the securities purchase agreement with AEI Capital
Ltd. whereby we were: (1) granted the right to sell two additional tranches of common stock to AEI Capital Ltd. of 3.0 million each,
for an aggregate amount of 9.0 million under the securities purchase agreement; and (2) our ability to sell shares of common stock to
AEI Capital Ltd. under the securities purchase agreement was extended until December 31, 2025. 

Although the Company only has cash and cash equivalents
of 1.6 million as of September 30, 2024, in October 2024, pursuant to the Amendment, which granted the Company the right to sell two
additional tranches of common stock to AEI Capital Ltd. of 3.0 million each, for an aggregate amount of 9.0 million under the August
2024 Securities Purchase Agreement until December 31, 2025, the Company currently has the right, in its discretion, to sell to AEI Capital
Ltd. shares of common stock of the Company having an aggregate value of up to an additional 7.0 million. As a result, the Company believes
that its current cash and its access to additional cash under the August 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement will allow the Company to
fund operations in excess of 12 months from the issuance date of these financial statements. 

Sources
and uses of cash 

Our
principal source of liquidity is from financing activities, including issuances of equity and debt securities. The following table summarizes
the net cash and cash equivalents (used in) provided by operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the periods
indicated:

Net
cash used in operating activities 

 Net
cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of our net income of 7.6 million
adjusted for certain noncash items, including share-based compensation expense of 0.6 million and changes in operating assets and liabilities
of 0.5 million, reduced by certain non-cash items, including gain on change in fair value of EIB loan guaranty of 10.9 million, gain
on impairment adjustment of 2.1 million, and gain on settlement of compensation expenses of 0.6 million. Net cash used in operating
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted primarily of our net loss of 15.6 million, reduced by certain
noncash items, including depreciation and amortization expense of 1.1 million, noncash interest expense of 1.3 million, change in inventory
reserve of 0.5 million, and share-based compensation expense of 0.1 million. 

35 

Net
cash used in investing activities 

 Net
cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of purchases of property and equipment. 

Net
cash provided by financing activities 

 Net cash provided by financing
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock in connection
with the March 2024 Purchase Agreement with David E. Lazar and, subsequently, AEI Capital Ltd., as assignee from Mr. Lazar, and proceeds
from the issuance of common stock in connection with the August 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement with AEI Capital Ltd. Net cash provided
by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of proceeds from the issuance of common stock and warrants,
net of issuance costs, in connection with the Company s financings in January and May 2023, partially offset by payments on the
Company s debt with the EIB. 

Contractual
Commitments 

Subsequent to the insolvency filings of Curetis
and Ares Genetics in November 2023 and the resulting deconsolidation, and following the Company s settlements with EIB and Curetis
in August 2024, other than the continuing liability under our former headquarters office lease, which lease was assigned to a third
party in April 2024, the Company has no other material contractual commitments as of September 30, 2024. 

Critical
accounting policies and use of estimates 

This
Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. In our audited consolidated financial statements, estimates are used for, but not limited to, liquidity assumptions, revenue
recognition, stock-based compensation, allowances for doubtful accounts and inventory obsolescence, property and equipment, lease right-of-use
assets, discount rates used to discount unpaid lease payments to present values, valuation of derivative financial instruments measured
at fair value on a recurring basis, and deferred tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. 

A
summary of our significant accounting policies is included in Note 3 Summary of significant accounting policies to the
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Certain of our accounting policies are considered critical, as these
policies require significant, difficult or complex judgments by management, often requiring the use of estimates about the effects of
matters that are inherently uncertain. Our critical policies are summarized in Item 7. Management s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2023. 

Off-balance
sheet arrangements 

As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

As
a smaller reporting company, the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item.

Item 4.
Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management,
including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. 

Our
management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer concluded that, due to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting noted in our
amended quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not
effective as of September 30, 2024. 

Previously
Identified Material Weakness in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

A
material weakness is a significant deficiency, or combination of significant deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,
such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements
will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As previously reported in the Company s amended Form 10-Q for the three
months ended March 31, 2024, the Company concluded it did not design and maintain effective controls over the completeness and accuracy
of the accounting for, and disclosure of, a complex accounting transaction as of March 31, 2024. This material weakness resulted
in a material error in the Company s originally issued unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in the Company s
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. 

Management s
Remediation Efforts for Previously Identified Material Weakness in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

In response to the material
weakness described above, with the oversight of the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, the Company is conducting and will continue
to conduct more thorough and diligent accounting research and will engage third-party consultants and accounting experts to assist with
complex accounting transactions. 

The
remediation efforts are intended both to address the identified material weakness and to enhance our overall financial control environment.
The Company is committed to continuous improvement of its internal control over financial reporting and will continue to diligently review
its internal control over financial reporting. The Company cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, or that we may
take in the future, will be sufficient to remediate the material weakness we identified or avoid potential future material weaknesses.
Accordingly, there could continue to be a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements would not be
prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

For
the quarter ended September 30, 2024, other than the ongoing remediation efforts discussed above, there have been no changes in
the Company s internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting.

Part
II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1.
Legal Proceedings 

From
time to time, we may be a party to litigation or subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of business. Although the results
of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe we are party to any claim or litigation; the outcome of
which, if determined adversely to us, would individually or in the aggregate be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect
on our business. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us due to defense and settlement costs, diversion
of management resources and other factors. 

There were no material changes in litigation from
that reported in our Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2024 and Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Item 1A.
Risk Factors 

Except as set forth below,
there have been no other material changes to our risk factors since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

We
cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to comply with the Nasdaq minimum stockholders equity requirement or other
continued listing standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market. If we are unable to maintain compliance with such standards, we could be subject
to delisting or other adverse action, which could negatively impact the trading of our common stock. 

On June 5, 2024, the Company received a letter
from the listing staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq that the Company was no longer in compliance with the minimum
stockholders equity requirement for continued listing on Nasdaq pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (the Stockholders 
Equity Rule ). The Stockholders Equity Rule requires companies listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market to maintain stockholders 
equity of at least 2,500,000 or to meet alternatives of market value of listed securities or net income from continuing operations, which
the Company does not currently meet. In response to the letter, the Company submitted its plan to regain compliance with the Stockholders 
Equity Rule to the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the Panel and requested additional time to regain compliance with such rule.
On August 16, 2024, following the Panel s review of the Company s plan to regain compliance, the Company received a letter
(the Notice indicating that the Panel had determined to deny the Company s request for continued listing on Nasdaq.
Pursuant to the Notice, based on the preliminary nature of the Company s plan, the Panel determined that the Company did not provide
a definitive plan evidencing its ability to achieve near- and long-term compliance with the Stockholders Equity Requirement. The
Notice also provided that the Company s securities will be suspended from trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market at the opening of
business on August 20, 2024. The Company submitted its appeal regarding the Panel s determination on September 13, 2024 and requested
that the Nasdaq Listing and Hearing Review Council review the decision of the Panel. Such appeal stayed the delisting of the Company s
securities with Nasdaq and the filing of the Form 25 pending the Nasdaq Listing and Hearing Review Council s decision until the
resolution of such review. 

While the Company intends
to comply with such conditions and rules, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to regain or remain in compliance with
the Stockholders Equity Rule or other applicable Nasdaq listing requirements on an ongoing and long-term basis or that the Nasdaq
Listing and Hearing Review Council will grant the Company additional time to achieve compliance. If we are unable to satisfy these requirements
or standards, we could be subject to delisting, which could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair
your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. 

Adverse conditions affecting foreign financial
institutions and credit markets could impair our liquidity or interrupt our access to our cash and cash equivalents, which could adversely
affect our operations. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately
 1.6 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents are held in bank demand deposit accounts with a significant portion
held in foreign bank accounts with foreign institutions. Disruptions in the foreign financial markets or with such foreign financial institutions
may, in some cases, result in an inability for us to access our cash or cash equivalents, such as cash held in money market funds that
traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid. Any failure of our counterparty financial institutions in which we have deposits may
adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and, in turn, our financial position and operations. 

In addition, our cash and
cash equivalents held in foreign institutions are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC ). Accordingly,
in the event of any loss by such foreign institutions or if any such institutions experience financial difficulties, our cash and cash
equivalents may not be insured, and we may not be able to recover the full amount of our assets, which could result in material financial
losses.
