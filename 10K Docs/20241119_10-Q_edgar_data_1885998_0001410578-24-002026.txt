The Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Units, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully. The Company must complete a Business Combination having an aggregate fair market value of at least of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding taxes payable on income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into an initial Business Combination. The Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.

 either immediately prior to or upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks stockholder approval, a majority of the shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. If a stockholder vote is not required by law and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation ), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and file tender offer documents with the SEC containing substantially the same information as would be included in a proxy statement prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain stockholder approval for business or legal reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If the Company seeks stockholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the holders of the Company s shares prior to the Initial Public Offering (the Initial Stockholders have agreed (a) to vote their Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5), Private Shares (as defined in Note 4) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of approving a Business Combination and (b) not to redeem any shares in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a Business Combination or sell any shares to the Company in a tender offer in connection with a Business Combination. Additionally, each public stockholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of how or whether they vote on the proposed transaction or do not vote at all. On December 1, 2023, the Company s stockholders approved an amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation which expanded the methods that the Company may employ to not become subject to the penny stock rules of the SEC. The Initial Stockholders have agreed (a) to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares, Private Shares and Public Shares held by them in connection with the completion of a Business Combination and (b) not to propose an amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation that would affect a public stockholders ability to convert or sell their shares to the Company in connection with a Business Combination or affect the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to redeem of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination, unless the Company provides the public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment. The Company will have until December 3, 2024 (unless the Company extends the period of time it has to complete an initial business combination) to complete a Business Combination (the Combination Period ). If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay taxes and liquidation expenses, divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s remaining stockholders and the Company s board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. On May 17, 2023, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders (the May Special Meeting ), at which the Company s stockholders approved an amendment (the Extension Amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to give the Company the right to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination up to six ) times, each such extension for an additional one ) month period, from June 3, 2023 to December 4, 2023. In connection with the May Special Meeting stockholders exercised their right to redeem shares of common stock for an aggregate price of approximately per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of . On October 9, 2023, the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq notified the Company that it did not comply with Nasdaq s minimum 400 Total Holders requirement set forth in Listing Rule 5450(a)(2) (the Rule ). Based on Nasdaq s further review and the materials submitted by the Company on November 24, 2023, January 5, 2024, and February 19, 2024, Nasdaq determined to grant the Company an extension of time to regain compliance with the Rule. On May 13, 2024, Nasdaq notified the Company that it did not regain compliance with the requirement during the extension period. On May 17, 2023, the Company requested a hearing before a Nasdaq Hearing Panel (the Panel ). A hearing on this matter was held on June 27, 2024 and on July 3, 2024, Nasdaq notified the Company that

The Initial Stockholders have agreed to waive their liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares and Private Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the Initial Stockholders acquire Public Shares in or after the Initial Public Offering, such Public Shares will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the per share value deposited into the Trust Account ).

 per Public Share, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a valid and enforceable agreement with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the Trust Account and except as to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Initial Stockholders will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Initial Stockholders will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except the Company s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary. All significant balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Liquidity and Going Concern As of September 30, 2024, the Company had in its operating bank account and a working capital deficit of . Until the consummation of a Business Combination, the Company will be using the funds not held in the Trust Account for performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, and structuring, negotiating, and consummating the Business Combination. On July 26, 2023, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note in the aggregate amount of up to (the July Note to individuals or entities listed on the Note. The Note is non-interest bearing and is payable on the earlier of (i) the date on which the Company consummates an initial business combination or (ii) the date the Company liquidates if a Business Combination is not consummated. The July Note will be repaid only from amounts remaining outside of the Company s Trust Account, if any. The proceeds will be used by the Company to pay various expenses of the Company, including the extension payments, and for general corporate purposes. At September 30, 2024, there was outstanding under the July Note. On March 27, 2024, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note in the aggregate amount of up to (the March Note to individuals or entities listed on the Note. The March Note is non-interest bearing and is payable on the earlier of (i) the date on which the Company consummates an initial business combination or (ii) the date the Company liquidates if a Business Combination is not consummated. The March Note will be repaid only from amounts remaining outside of the Company s Trust Account, if any. The proceeds will be used by the Company to pay various expenses of the Company, including the extension payments, and for general corporate purposes. At September 30, 2024, there was outstanding under the March Note. The Company will need to raise additional capital through loans or additional investments from the Initial Stockholders or its officers, directors or their affiliates. The Initial Stockholders and the Company s officers and directors or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds, from time to time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet the Company s working capital needs. Accordingly, the Company may not be able to obtain additional financing. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital, it may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of a potential transaction, and reducing overhead expenses. The Company cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to it on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. If an initial business combination is not consummated by December 3, 2024, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern one year from the date that these financial statements are issued. The Company plans to address this uncertainty through working capital loans and through consummation

 excise tax on certain repurchases of stock by publicly traded U.S. domestic corporations and certain U.S. domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations occurring on or after January 1, 2023. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its shareholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally 1 of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the Treasury has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax. Any redemption or other repurchase that occurs after December 31, 2022, in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise, may be subject to the excise tax. Whether and to what extent the Company would be subject to the excise tax in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise would depend on a number of factors, including (i) the fair market value of the redemptions and repurchases in connection with the Business Combination, extension or otherwise, (ii) the structure of a Business Combination, (iii) the nature and amount of any PIPE or other equity issuances in connection with a Business Combination (or otherwise issued not in connection with a Business Combination but issued within the same taxable year of a Business Combination) and (iv) the content of regulations and other guidance from the Treasury. In addition, because the excise tax would be payable by the Company and not by the redeeming holder, the mechanics of any required payment of the excise tax have not been determined. The foregoing could cause a reduction in the cash available on hand to complete a Business Combination and in the Company s ability to complete a Business Combination. In connection with the stockholders vote at the May Special Meeting, public stockholders exercised their right to redeem shares of common stock for a total of . In connection with the stockholders vote at the December Special Meeting, shares of common stock were tendered for redemption as of December 1, 2023. Excise tax should be recognized in the period incurred, that is when the repurchase occurs. Any reduction in the tax liability due to a subsequent stock issuance, or an event giving rise to an exception, which occurs within a tax year should be recorded in the period of such stock issuance or event giving rise to an exception. As of September 30, 2024, the Company recorded of excise tax liability calculated as of shares redeemed on May 31, 2023 and December 1, 2023. During the second quarter, the IRS issued final regulations with respect to the timing and payment of the excise tax. Pursuant to those regulations, the Company would need to file a return and remit payment for any liability incurred during the period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 on or before October 31, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating its options with respect to payment of this obligation. If the Company is unable to pay its obligation in full, it will be subject to additional interest and penalties which are currently estimated at interest per annum and a

ASC 740 also clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. ASC 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim period, disclosure and transition.

References to our management or our management team refer to our officers and directors. The following discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), that are not historical facts and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected and projected. All statements, other than statements of historical fact included in this Quarterly Report including, without limitation, statements in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations regarding the search for an initial business combination, the Company s financial position, business strategy and the plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. Words such as expect, believe, anticipate, intend, estimate, seek and variations and similar words and expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements relate to future events or future performance, but reflect management s current beliefs, based on information currently available. A number of factors could cause actual events, performance or results to differ materially from the events, performance and results discussed in the forward-looking statements. For information identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the Risk Factors section of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the Company s final prospectus for its initial public offering filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ).

Except as expressly required by applicable securities law, the Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Overview We are a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 5, 2020 for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses. We intend to effectuate our Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Units, our capital stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt. The issuance of additional shares of our stock in an initial business combination: may significantly reduce the equity interest of our stockholders; may subordinate the rights of holders of common stock if we issue preferred shares with rights senior to those afforded to our shares of common stock; will likely cause a change in control if a substantial number of our shares of common stock are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and most likely will also result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; and may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our securities. Similarly, if we issue debt securities or otherwise incur significant indebtedness, it could result in: default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after a business combination are insufficient to pay our debt obligations; our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand; and our inability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain additional financing while such security is outstanding.

 On September 30, 2024, the Company and NEH entered into the Fourth Amendment to the Business Combination Agreement and Plan of Reorganization Amendment (the Fourth Amendment pursuant to which, among other things the parties extended the Outside Date to November 30, 2024. Extensions of the Combination Period On May 17, 2023, we held a special meeting of stockholders (the May 2023 Meeting ), at which our stockholders approved an amendment (the May Extension Amendment to the Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation to give the Company the right to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination (the Combination Period up to six (6) times, each such extension for an additional one (1) month period, from June 3, 2023 to December 4, 2023. In connection with the stockholders vote at the May 2023 Meeting, 8,989,488 shares of common stock were tendered for redemption. On May 3 and 4, 2023, we entered into non-redemption agreements with certain stockholders owning, in the aggregate, 2,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock, pursuant to which such stockholders agreed, among other things, not to redeem or exercise any right to redeem such public shares in connection with the May Extension Amendment. Certain initial stockholders of the Company agreed to pay the stockholders that entered into such agreements 0.04 per share for each one-month extension in connection with such agreements. On July 20, 2023, we entered into amendments to the non-redemption agreements to provide that the Company or certain initial stockholders of the Company, or their affiliates or designees, will pay such stockholders that entered into such non-redemption agreements 0.04 per share for each one-month extension in connection with such agreements.

At present, the Company has until December 3, 2024 to complete its initial business combination. The Company s board of directors believes that there may not be sufficient time before December 3, 2024 to complete the Business Combination or an alternate initial business combination. Therefore, the board of directors has determined that it is desirable to provide the Company with an option to extend the Combination Period up to six times, each such extension for an additional one-month period, from December 3, 2024 to June 4, 2025 (the Proposed Extension ), in order to provide its stockholders with the opportunity to participate in a prospective investment. Accordingly, On November 18, 2024, the Company filed a definitive proxy statement with the SEC in order to convene a special meeting of stockholders seeking approval to amend the Current Charter and extend the Combination Period for additional one-month periods up to June 4, 2025. The definitive proxy statement was mailed to stockholders of record as of October 28, 2024 in order to hold a special meeting of stockholders to vote on the Proposed Extension. The special meeting will be held at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time on November 29, 2024.

 Following the Initial Public Offering, including the full exercise of the over-allotment option by the underwriters, and the sale of the Private Units, a total of 116,725,000 was placed in a trust account located in the United States (the Trust Account ). We incurred 1,625,220 in transaction costs, consisting of 1,150,000 of underwriting fees and 475,220 of other offering costs.

As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 17,928,070. We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account (less income taxes payable), to complete our initial business combination. We may withdraw interest to pay taxes. Through September 30, 2024, we withdrew an amount of 132,152 of interest income from the Trust Account. To the extent that our capital stock or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our initial business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. As of September 30, 2024, we had 6,620 of cash held outside of the Trust Account. We intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete an initial business combination. In order to finance transaction costs in connection with an initial business combination, the Initial Stockholders, or certain of our officers and directors or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required Working Capital Loans ). If we complete an initial business combination, we would repay the Working Capital Loans out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to us. Otherwise, the Working Capital Loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the Trust Account. In the event that an initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans, but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. The Working Capital Loans would be repaid upon consummation of an initial business combination, without interest. On July 26, 2023, we issued an unsecured promissory note in the aggregate amount of up to 750,000 (the July Note to individuals or entities listed on the Note. The July Note is non-interest bearing and is payable on the earlier of (i) the date on which the Company consummates an initial business combination or (ii) the date the Company liquidates if a Business Combination is not consummated. The July Note will be repaid only from amounts remaining outside of the Company s Trust Account, if any. The proceeds will be used by the Company to pay various expenses of the Company, including the extension payments, and for general corporate purposes. On March 27, 2024, we issued an unsecured promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of up to 600,000 (the December Note to individuals or entities listed on the Note (the Payees ). Pursuant to the December Note, the Payees agreed to loan to the Company an aggregate amount of up to 600,000 that shall be payable on the earlier of (i) the date on which the Company consummates an initial business combination as such term is defined in the Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the Business Combination ), or (ii) the date the Company liquidates if a Business Combination is not consummated.

As of September 30, 2024, there were 1,287,944 of Working Capital Loans outstanding.

Table of Contents 
 If our estimate of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating an initial business combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our initial business combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our initial business combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our Public Shares upon completion of our initial business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such initial business combination. Going Concern We will need to raise additional capital through loans or additional investments from the Initial Stockholders and our officers and directors. The Initial Stockholders and our officers and directors or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet our working capital needs. Accordingly, we may not be able to obtain additional financing. If we are unable to raise additional capital, we may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of a potential transaction, and reducing overhead expenses. We cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. If an initial business combination is not consummated by December 3, 2024, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern one year from the date that these financial statements are issued. We plan to address this uncertainty through working capital loans and through consummation of our initial business combination. There is no assurance that working capital loans will be available to the Company or that our plans to consummate a business combination will be successful; therefore, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. There is no assurance that working capital loans will be available to us or that our plans to consummate an initial business combination will be successful. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. Contractual Obligations We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than as described below. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were Working Capital Loans outstanding of 1,287,944 and 416,841, respectively. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of condensed financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies: 

 31 

Table of Contents 
 Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption We account for our common stock subject to possible conversion in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. Common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that features redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders equity. Our common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, common stock subject to possible redemption is presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders equity section of our balance sheets. Net (Loss) Income Per Common Share We have two types of common stock redeemable common stock and non-redeemable common stock. We calculate our earnings per share to allocate net (loss) income pro rata to redeemable and non-redeemable common stock. This presentation contemplates an initial business combination as the most likely outcome, in which case, both classes of common stock share pro rata in our (loss) income. Net (loss) income per common share is computed by dividing net (loss) income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. In order to determine the net (loss) income attributable to both the redeemable and non-redeemable common stock, we first considered the total (loss) income allocable to both sets of shares. This is calculated using the total net (loss) income less any dividends paid. For the purposes of calculating net (loss) income per share, any remeasurement of the accretion to redemption value of the redeemable common stock subject to redemption and the excise tax calculated on the redemption of shares were considered to be dividends paid to the holders of the redeemable common stock. Subsequent to calculating the total (loss) income allocable to both sets of shares, we split the amount to be allocated pro rata between redeemable and non-redeemable common stock for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to make disclosures under this Item.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the chief executive officers and chief financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management evaluated, with the participation of our current chief executive officers and chief financial officer (our Certifying Officers ), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Certifying Officers concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
