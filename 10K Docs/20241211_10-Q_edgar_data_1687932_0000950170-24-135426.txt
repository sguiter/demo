As of November 2, 2024, there was million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSUs, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average service period of years. The total fair value of RSUs vested during the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023 was million and million, respectively. Performance Stock Units For the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, the Board granted PSUs, a portion of which are based on achieving an adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization Adjusted EBITDA goal and the remaining portion is based on achieving an annualized absolute total shareholder return TSR growth goal. Each PSU award reflects a target number of shares Target Shares that may be issued to the award recipient provided the employee continues to provide services to the Company throughout the three-year performance period of the award. For Adjusted EBITDA based PSUs, the number of units earned will be determined based on the achievement of the predetermined Adjusted EBITDA goals at the end of each performance year, and for TSR based PSUs, the number of units earned will be determined based on the achievement of the predetermined TSR growth goal at the end of a three-year performance period. The TSR is based on J.Jill s -trading day average beginning and closing price of the performance period, assuming the reinvestment of dividends. Depending on the performance results based on Adjusted EBITDA and TSR, the actual number of shares that a grant recipient receives at the end of the vesting period may range from to of the Target Shares granted. PSUs are converted into shares of common stock upon vesting, under the terms of the A R Plan. In connection with the cash dividend paid on the Company s common stock and in accordance with the terms of the A R Plan, participants holding PSUs were credited with dividend equivalent PSUs, a portion of which are based on an Adjusted EBITDA goal and the remaining portion is based on achieving an annualized TSR growth goal, each subject to the same vesting terms as the corresponding PSUs.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q (the Quarterly Report ). The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and assumptions. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in the sections of this Quarterly Report titled Risk Factors and Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. 
 We operate on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the Saturday that is closest to January 31. Each fiscal year generally is comprised of four 13-week fiscal quarters, although in the years with 53 weeks, the fourth quarter represents a 14-week period. The fiscal year ending February 1, 2025 Fiscal Year 2024 is comprised of 52 weeks and fiscal year ended February 3, 2024 Fiscal Year 2023 was comprised of 53 weeks. 
 All references in this Quarterly Report to J.Jill, we, our, us, the Company or similar terms are to J.Jill, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
 Overview 
 J.Jill is a national lifestyle brand that provides apparel, footwear and accessories designed to help its customers move through a full life with ease. The brand represents an easy, thoughtful and inspired style that celebrates the totality of all women and designs its products with its core brand ethos in mind: keep it simple and make it matter. J.Jill offers a high touch customer experience through over 200 stores nationwide and a robust ecommerce platform. J.Jill is headquartered outside Boston. 
 Factors Affecting Our Operating Results 
 Various factors are expected to continue to affect our results of operations going forward, including the following: 
 Overall Economic Trends . Consumer purchases of clothing and other merchandise generally decline during recessionary periods and other periods when disposable income is adversely affected, and consequently our results of operations may be affected by general economic conditions. For example, reduced consumer confidence, lower availability, inflationary pressures and higher cost of consumer credit may reduce demand for our merchandise and may limit our ability to increase or sustain prices. The growth rate of the market could be affected by macroeconomic conditions in the United States and abroad. Additionally, the occurrence or reoccurrence of any significant pandemic, regional conflicts, or other geopolitical disruptions could impact our sales and business operations. 
 Consumer Preferences and Fashion Trends . Our ability to maintain our appeal to existing customers and attract new customers depends on our ability to anticipate fashion trends. During periods in which we have successfully anticipated fashion trends, we have generally had more favorable results. 
 Competition . The retail industry is highly competitive and retailers compete based on a variety of factors, including design, quality, price and customer service. Levels of competition and the ability of our competitors to more accurately predict fashion trends and otherwise attract customers through competitive pricing or other factors may impact our results of operations. 
 Our Strategic Initiatives . The ongoing implementation of strategic initiatives will continue to have an impact on our results of operations. These initiatives include our ecommerce platform and our initiative to upgrade and enhance our information systems, including the upgrade of our order management system. Although initiatives of this nature are designed to create growth in our business and continue improvement in our operating results, the timing of expenditures related to these initiatives, as well as the achievement of returns on our investments, may affect our results of operations in future periods. 
 Pricing and Changes in Our Merchandise Mix or Supply Chain Issues . Our product offering changes from period to period, as do the prices at which goods are sold and the margins we are able to earn from the sales of those goods. The levels at which we are able to price our merchandise are influenced by a variety of factors, including the quality of our products, cost of production, prices at which our competitors are selling similar products, sourcing and/or distributing product, and the willingness of our customers to pay for products. 
 Potential Changes in Tax Laws and/or Regulations . Changes in tax laws in any of the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, or adverse outcomes from tax audits that we may be subject to in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Additionally, any potential changes with respect to tax and trade policies, tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries could adversely affect our business, as we source the majority of our merchandise from manufacturers located outside of the U.S.

 How We Assess the Performance of Our Business 
 In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of financial and operating metrics, including financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and non-GAAP measures, such as: 
 Net sales consist primarily of revenues, net of merchandise returns and discounts, generated from the sale of apparel and accessory merchandise through our retail stores Retail and through our website and catalog orders Direct ). Net sales also include shipping and handling fees collected from customers, royalty revenues and marketing reimbursements related to our private label credit card agreement. Retail revenue is recognized at the time of sale and Direct revenue is recognized upon shipment of merchandise to the customer. 
 Net sales are impacted by the size of our active customer base, product assortment and availability, marketing and promotional activities and the spending habits of our customers. Net sales are also impacted by the migration of single-channel customers to omnichannel customers who, on average, spend three times more than single-channel customers. 
 Total company comparable sales include net sales from our retail stores that have been open for more than 52 weeks and from our Direct channel. This measure highlights the performance of existing stores open during the period, while excluding the impact of new store openings and closures. When a store in the total company comparable store base is temporarily closed for four or more days within a fiscal week, the store is excluded from the comparable store base; if it is temporarily closed for three or fewer days within a fiscal week, the store is included within the comparable store base. Certain of our competitors and other retailers may calculate total company comparable sales differently than we do. Our comparable sales are based on a 52-week period. The total company comparable sales calculation shifts the weeks in the fiscal year containing the fifty-third week to align like-for-like. As a result, the reporting of our total company comparable sales may not be comparable to sales data made available by other companies. 
 Number of stores reflects all stores open at the end of a reporting period. In connection with opening new stores, we incur pre-opening costs. Pre-opening costs include expenses incurred prior to opening a new store and primarily consist of payroll, travel, training, marketing, initial opening supplies and costs of transporting initial inventory and fixtures to retail stores, as well as occupancy costs incurred from the time of possession of a store site to the opening of that store. In connection with closing stores, we incur store-closing costs. Store-closing costs primarily consist of lease termination penalties and costs of transporting inventory and fixtures to other store locations. These pre-opening and store-closing costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses and are generally incurred and expensed within 30 days of opening a new store or closing a store. 
 Gross profit is equal to our net sales less costs of goods sold. Gross profit as a percentage of our net sales is referred to as gross margin. 
 Costs of goods sold COGS consists of the direct costs of sold merchandise, which include customs, taxes, duties, commissions and inbound shipping costs, inventory shrinkage, adjustments and reserves for excess, aged and obsolete inventory. COGS does not include distribution center costs and allocations of indirect costs, such as occupancy, depreciation, amortization, or labor and benefits. We review our inventory levels on an ongoing basis to identify slow-moving merchandise and use markdowns to liquidate these products. Changes in the assortment of our products may also impact our gross profit. The timing and level of markdowns are driven by customer acceptance of our merchandise. The Company s COGS, and consequently gross profit, may not be comparable to those of other retailers, as inclusion of certain costs vary across the industry. 
 The variability in COGS is due to raw materials, transportation and freight costs. These costs fluctuate based on certain factors beyond our control, including labor conditions, inbound transportation or freight costs, energy prices, currency fluctuations and commodity prices. We place orders with merchandise suppliers in U.S. dollars and, as a result, are not exposed to significant foreign currency exchange risk. 
 Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses include all operating costs not included in COGS. These expenses consist primarily of all payroll and related expenses, occupancy costs, information systems costs and other operating expenses related to our stores and operations at our headquarters, including utilities, depreciation and amortization. These expenses also consist of marketing expense, including catalog production and mailing costs, warehousing, distribution and outbound shipping costs, customer service operations, consulting and software services, natural disasters, professional services and other administrative costs. Additionally, our outbound shipping costs may fluctuate due to surcharges from shipping vendors based on demand for shipping services. 
 With the exception of store selling expenses, certain marketing expenses and incentive compensation, SG A expenses generally do not vary proportionately with net sales. As a result, SG A expenses as a percentage of net sales are usually higher in lower-volume periods and lower in higher-volume periods.

 Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income plus depreciation and amortization, income tax provision, interest expense, interest expense - related party, interest income, equity-based compensation expense, write-off of property and equipment, amortization of cloud-based software implementation costs, loss on extinguishment of debt, loss on debt refinancing, adjustment for exited retail stores, impairment of long-lived assets, loss due to hurricane, and other non-recurring items primarily consisting of outside legal and professional fees associated with certain non-recurring transactions and events. We present Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis because management uses it as a supplemental measure in assessing our operating performance, and we believe that it is helpful to investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as a measure of our comparative operating performance from period to period. We also use Adjusted EBITDA as one of the primary methods for planning and forecasting overall expected performance of our business and for evaluating on a quarterly and annual basis actual results against such expectations. Further, we recognize Adjusted EBITDA as a commonly used measure in determining business value and as such, use it internally to report results. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents, for any period, Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales. 
 While we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful in evaluating our business, Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that has limitations as an analytical tool. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to, or substitute for, net income, which is calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently or not at all, which reduces the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA as a tool for comparison. We recommend that you review the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, and the calculation of the resultant Adjusted EBITDA margin below and not rely solely on Adjusted EBITDA or any single financial measure to evaluate our business. 
 Reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA and Calculation of Adjusted EBITDA Margin 
 The following table provides a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA and the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA margin for the periods presented.

 Net sales for the thirteen weeks ended November 2, 2024 increased 0.4 million, or 0.3 , to 151.3 million from 150.9 million for the thirteen weeks ended October 28, 2023. At the end of those same periods, we operated 247 and 245 retail stores, respectively. The increase in net sales was primarily due to the impact of approximately 2.0 million from the calendar shift resulting from the fifty-third week in Fiscal Year 2023, and lower merchandise returns offset by higher promotional activities and lost sales due to hurricane for the thirteen weeks ended November 2, 2024. The total company comparable sales decreased by 0.8 compared to the thirteen weeks ended October 28, 2023. 
 Retail contributed 54.3 of our net sales in the thirteen weeks ended November 2, 2024 and 54.4 in the thirteen weeks ended October 28, 2023. Our Direct channel contributed 45.7 of our net sales in the thirteen weeks ended November 2, 2024 and 45.6 in the thirteen weeks ended October 28, 2023.

The gross margin for the thirteen weeks ended November 2, 2024 was 71.4 compared to 72.0 for the thirteen weeks ended October 28, 2023. The decrease in gross profit and gross margin for the thirteen weeks ended November 2, 2024 was primarily driven by an increase in promotional activities and increased freight costs due to higher ocean freight container shipping rates compared to the thirteen weeks ended October 28, 2023. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 SG A expenses for the thirteen weeks ended November 2, 2024 increased 2.2 million, or 2.5 , to 88.6 million from 86.5 million for the thirteen weeks ended October 28, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by 1.4 million increase in compensation and related expenses, 0.7 million increase in outbound shipping costs, 0.4 million increase in marketing expenses, and 0.4 million of order management system implementation expenses, offset by a decrease in management incentive of 0.7 million. 
 For the thirteen weeks ended November 2, 2024, the Company recorded a loss due to hurricane of 0.3 million related to write-off of property and equipment and inventory.

 Impairment of long-lived assets 
 For the thirteen weeks ended November 2, 2024, the Company recorded 0.1 million of impairment charges. The Company recorded an immaterial amount of impairment charges for the thirteen weeks ended October 28, 2023. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense was 2.8 million and 6.5 million for the thirteen weeks ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, respectively. The decrease was due to a lower debt balance for the thirteen weeks ended November 2, 2024.

The effective tax rate during the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 is lower primarily due to the impact of state and local income taxes and executive compensation limitations. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 General 
 Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash and cash equivalents generated from operating activities and availability under our ABL Facility, so long as certain conditions related to the maturity of the Term Loan Credit Agreement are met. As of November 2, 2024, we had 38.8 million in cash and 35.7 million of total availability under our ABL Facility. In addition, through our shelf registration statement on file with the SEC or through private transactions, and depending on conditions prevailing in the public and private capital markets, we may from time to time issue equity securities in one or more series in one or more offerings. 
 On June 14, 2024, the Company issued and sold 1,000,000 shares of its common stock. The shares were offered at an offering price of 31.00 per share, less underwriting discounts and commissions. The Company utilized the net proceeds from its sale of shares for repayment of its debt and general corporate purposes. See Note 8. Shareholders Equity to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for additional information on the Company s common stock issuance. 
 During the third quarter of Fiscal Year 2024, the Company issued 3,572,664 shares of common stock following the exercise of 3,573,707 warrants (the Warrants that were previously issued pursuant to a Warrant Agreement, dated as of October 2, 2020, by and between the Company and American Stock Transfer Company LLC (the Warrant Agreement ). The exercise price of the Warrants was net share settled as per the terms of the Warrant Agreement. Given the non-substantive exercise price of the Warrants in relation to the fair value of the common shares issued upon exercise, the exercise of these Warrants had no impact on net income per common share, both basic and diluted. 
 Subsequent to November 2, 2024, on December 6, 2024, the Board approved a share repurchase program (the Share Repurchase Program ), under which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to 25.0 million of the Company s common stock, over the next two years. Under the Share Repurchase Program, shares of the Company s common stock may be purchased from time to time through open market or private transactions, block trades, or such other manner as the Company may determine, in accordance with applicable insider trading and other securities laws and regulations under the Exchange Act. The timing and the number of shares repurchased are subject to the discretion of the Company and may be affected by market conditions and other factors. The Share Repurchase Program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock and may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time. 
 We believe our cash and cash equivalents balance, along with our future cash flows from operations, capacity for borrowings under the ABL Facility and access to credit and capital markets, provide sufficient liquidity to meet the needs of our business operations, make voluntary prepayments, pay dividends, repurchase shares, and to satisfy our projected cash requirements for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future.
