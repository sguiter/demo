 Overview 
 Wayfair is one of the world s largest online destinations for the home. Through our e-commerce business model, we offer visually inspired browsing, compelling merchandising, easy product discovery and attractive prices for over 30 million products from over 20 thousand suppliers. 
 We believe an increasing portion of the dollars spent on home goods will be spent online and that there is an opportunity for acquiring more market share. Our business model is designed to grow our net revenue by acquiring new customers as well as stimulating repeat purchases from our existing customers. Through increasing brand awareness as well as paid and unpaid advertising, we attract new and repeat customers to our family of sites. We turn these customers into recurring shoppers by creating a seamless shopping experience across their entire journey offering best-in-class product discovery, purchasing, fulfillment and customer service. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, net revenue decreased by 2.0 compared to the same period in 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we had 22 million active customers and during the three months ended September 30, 2024, 79.9 of orders came from repeat buyers. The lower sales were due to lower order volume, which was driven by challenges in the category, compared to the same period in 2023. We also continued to manage our advertising spend according to a return on investment-oriented approach that carefully tracks and monitors the results of advertising campaigns as we seek to maintain appropriate return targets. 
 Global Considerations 
 We are continuing to closely monitor macroeconomic impacts, including, but not limited to, geopolitical events and fluctuating interest rates and inflationary pressures on our business, results of operations and financial results. These developments have and may continue to negatively impact global economic activity and consumer behavior, which have and may continue to adversely affect our business and our results of operations. As our customers react to these global economic conditions, we may take additional precautionary measures to limit or delay expenditures and preserve capital and liquidity. 
 While it is difficult to quantify and predict all of the impacts these global economic events, including fluctuating interest rates and inflationary pressures, will have on our business and to predict consumer spending in the near term, we believe the long-term opportunity that we see for shopping for the home online remains unchanged. 
 We will continue to monitor economic conditions as we work to manage our business to meet the evolving needs of our customers, employees, suppliers, partners, stockholders and communities. 
 Factors Affecting our Performance 
 We believe that our performance and future success depend on a number of factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges, including those discussed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Key Financial Statement and Operating Metrics 
 We measure our business using the key financial statement and operating metrics that are reflected in the below table. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for more information regarding our use of Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Diluted Earnings or Loss per Share and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. 
 Our Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Diluted Earnings or Loss per Share are measured on a consolidated basis, while our Adjusted EBITDA is measured on a consolidated and reportable segment basis. All other key financial statement and operating metrics are derived and reported from our consolidated net revenue. 
 We use the following metrics to assess the near and longer-term performance of our overall business: Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (in millions, except LTM net revenue per active customer, average order value and per share data) Key Financial Statement Metrics: Net revenue 2,884 2,944 8,730 8,889 Gross profit 873 917 2,633 2,723 Loss from operations (74) (152) (344) (641) Net loss (74) (163) (364) (564) Loss per share: Basic (0.60) (1.40) (2.98) (4.99) Diluted (0.60) (1.40) (2.98) (4.99) Net cash provided by operating activities 49 121 155 191 Key Operating Metrics: Active customers (1)

 (1) The number of active customers represents the total number of individual customers who have purchased at least once directly from our sites during the preceding twelve-month period. The change in active customers in a reported period captures both the inflow of new customers as well as the outflow of existing customers who have not made a purchase in the last twelve months. We view the number of active customers as a key indicator of our growth. 
 (2) Last twelve months LTM net revenue per active customer represents our total net revenue in the last twelve months divided by our total number of active customers for the same preceding twelve-month period. We view LTM net revenue per active customer as a key indicator of our customers purchasing patterns, including their initial and repeat purchase behavior. 
 (3) Orders delivered represent the total orders delivered in any period, inclusive of orders that may eventually be returned. As we ship a large volume of packages through multiple carriers, actual delivery dates may not always be available, and as such we estimate delivery dates based on historical data. We recognize net revenue when an order is delivered, and therefore orders delivered, together with average order value, is an indicator of the net revenue we expect to recognize in a given period. We view orders delivered as a key indicator of our growth. 
 (4) We define average order value as total net revenue in a given period divided by the orders delivered in that period. We view average order value as a key indicator of the mix of products on our sites, the mix of offers and promotions and the purchasing behavior of our customers.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 As of September 30, 2024, our principal source of liquidity was cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling 1.3 billion. Additionally, we have a 600 million senior secured revolving credit facility that matures on March 24, 2026 (the Revolver ). As of September 30, 2024, there were no revolving loans outstanding under the Revolver. We had outstanding letters of credit, primarily as security for certain lease agreements, for 72 million as of September 30, 2024, which reduced the availability of credit under the Revolver. Excluding liquidity available through our Revolver, the following table shows sources of liquidity for the periods presented: September 30, December 31, 2024 2023 (in millions) Cash and cash equivalents 1,296 1,322 Short-term investments 32 29 Total liquidity 1,328 1,351

Table of Contents 

 We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and investments, cash generated from operations and the borrowing availability under our Revolver will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the foreseeable future including planned capital expenditures, contractual obligations and other such requirements. However, our liquidity assumptions may prove to be incorrect, and we could exhaust our available financial resources sooner than we currently expect. In addition, we may elect to raise additional funds at any time through equity, equity-linked or debt financing arrangements. Further, we may from time to time seek to retire, restructure, repurchase or redeem, or otherwise mitigate the equity dilution associated with our outstanding convertible debt through cash purchases, stock buybacks of some or all of the shares underlying convertible notes and/or exchanges for equity or debt in open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, exchanges or liability management exercises, if any, will be upon such terms and at such prices and sizes as we may determine, and will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. 
 Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those described herein and in our other filings with the SEC, including those set forth in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. In addition, macroeconomic events have caused disruption in the capital markets, fluctuating interest rates and moderate inflation, which could make obtaining financing more difficult and/or expensive. As a consequence, we may not be able to secure additional financing to meet our operating requirements on acceptable terms, or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt financing arrangements, those securities and instruments may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and the holders of our equity securities may experience dilution. We will continue to monitor our liquidity during this time of historic disruption and volatility in the global capital markets. 
 Credit Agreement and Debt Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 3.2 billion principal amount of indebtedness outstanding. 
 Under the terms of our Revolver, we may use proceeds to finance working capital, to refinance existing indebtedness and to provide funds for permitted acquisitions, repurchases of equity interests and other general corporate purposes. Any amounts outstanding under the Revolver are due at maturity. 
 On October 8, 2024, we issued 800 million aggregate principal amount of 7.250 senior secured notes due 2029. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing on April 15, 2025, until their maturity date of October 31, 2029. We intend to use the net proceeds from the senior secured notes offering, together with cash on hand, for the repayment, at or prior to maturity, of a portion of the Notes and general corporate purposes. 
 The conditional conversion features of the 2025 Notes, 2026 Notes, 2027 Notes and 2028 Notes were not triggered during the calendar quarter ended September 30, 2024, therefore, the 2025 Notes, 2026 Notes, 2027 Notes and 2028 Notes are not convertible during the calendar quarter ended December 31, 2024 pursuant to the applicable last reported sales price conditions. 
 As of August 1, 2024, the 2024 Notes were freely convertible and the holders of the 2024 Notes could have converted all or a portion of their 2024 Notes at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date; however, no holders converted their 2024 Notes during this time period. On November 1, 2024, the 2024 Notes matured and Wayfair paid in cash the remaining outstanding principal of 117 million to the holders of the 2024 Notes. 
 Whether any of the Non-Accreting Notes will be convertible in future quarters will depend on the satisfaction of the applicable last reported sales price condition or another conversion condition in the future. If one or more holders elect to convert their Non-Accreting Notes at a time when any such Non-Accreting Notes are convertible, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our Class A common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. 
 The credit agreement and indentures governing our convertible notes contain restrictions and covenants that may limit our operating flexibility. Specifically, the Revolver contains affirmative and negative covenants customarily applicable to senior secured credit facilities, including covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict our ability, subject to negotiated exceptions, to incur additional indebtedness and additional liens on our assets, engage in mergers or acquisitions or dispose of assets, pay dividends or make other distributions, voluntarily prepay other indebtedness, enter into transactions with affiliated persons, make investments, or change the nature of our businesses. The Revolver also requires us to maintain certain levels of performance in order to maintain our access to the Revolver. For instance, we are required to maintain a Consolidated Senior Secured Debt to Consolidated EBITDA Ratio (as defined in the credit agreement governing the Revolver) of 4.0 to 1.0, subject to a 0.5 step-up

 following certain permitted acquisitions. For information regarding our credit agreement and convertible notes, see Note 4, Debt and Other Financing , included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements , in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Note 6, Debt and Other Financing , included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all the terms and conditions of our debt agreements. 
 Stock Repurchase Program 
 On August 21, 2020, the board of directors (the Board authorized the repurchase of up to 700 million of our Class A common stock in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise, including pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan (the 2020 Repurchase Program ). On August 10, 2021, the Board authorized a new 1.0 billion share repurchase program on the same terms (the 2021 Repurchase Program together with the 2020 Repurchase Program, the Repurchase Programs ). There is no stated expiration date for the Share Repurchase Programs. We will begin repurchasing shares under the 2021 Repurchase Program upon the completion of the 2020 Repurchase Program. 
 The Repurchase Programs do not obligate us to purchase any shares of our Class A common stock and have no expiration but may be suspended or terminated by the Board at any time. The actual timing, number and value of shares repurchased under the Repurchase Programs in the future will be determined by us in our discretion and will depend on a number of factors, including market conditions, applicable legal requirements, our capital needs and whether there is a better alternative use of capital. As of September 30, 2024, we have repurchased 2,354,491 shares of Class A common stock for approximately 612 million under the Repurchase Programs. 
 Trends and Historical Cash Flows 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in millions) Net loss (364) (564) Net cash provided by operating activities 155 191 Net cash used in investing activities (178) (30) Net cash provided by financing activities 3 77 
 Operating Activities 
 Cash flows in connection with operating activities consisted of net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items including depreciation and amortization, equity-based compensation and certain other non-cash expenses, as well as the effect of changes in working capital and other activities. Operating cash flows can be volatile and are sensitive to many factors, including changes in working capital and our net loss. 
 Cash flows provided by operating activities decreased by 36 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to a decrease of 167 million for cash changes in operating assets and liabilities partially offset by an increase in net loss adjusted for non-cash items of 131 million. 
 Investing Activities 
 Cash flows used in investing activities increased by 148 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to decreases in sales and maturities of short- and long-term investments of 196 million and increases in purchases of short- and long-term investments of 33 million, partially offset by decreases in purchases of property and equipment and site and software development costs of 81 million. 
 Purchases of property and equipment and site and software development costs (collectively, Capital Expenditures were 2.0 of net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and related primarily to equipment purchases and improvements for leased warehouses within our expanding logistics network and ongoing investments, including in our proprietary technology and operational platform.

Table of Contents 

 Financing Activities 
 Cash flows provided by financing activities decreased by 74 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the net impact of debt and other financing transactions that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We do not engage in any off-balance sheet activities. We do not have any off-balance sheet interest in variable interest entities, which include special purpose entities and other structured finance entities. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations and estimates as compared to the contractual obligations described in Contractual Obligations included in Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 . 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 To provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we have disclosed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q the following non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Diluted Earnings or Loss per Share and Net Revenue Constant Currency Growth. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss before depreciation and amortization, equity-based compensation and related taxes, interest income or expense, net, other income or expense, net, provision or benefit for income taxes, net, non-recurring items and other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance. We have provided a reconciliation below of Adjusted EBITDA to net income or loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. 
 We disclose Adjusted EBITDA because it is a key measure used by our management and the Board to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. In particular, we believe the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis as these costs may vary independent of business performance. For instance, we exclude the impact of equity-based compensation and related taxes as we do not consider this item to be indicative of our core operating performance. Investors should, however, understand that equity-based compensation and related taxes will be a significant recurring expense in our business and an important part of the compensation provided to our employees. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and the Board. 
 Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: 
 Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; 
 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect equity-based compensation and related taxes; 
 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in our working capital; 
 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect income tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; 
 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expenses associated with our borrowings; 
 Adjusted EBITDA does not include other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance; and 
 Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. 
 Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net income or loss and our other GAAP results.

 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded charges of 1 million and 2 million, respectively, related to changes in sublease market conditions for U.S. office locations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded charges of 14 million, inclusive of 5 million related to consolidation of certain customer service centers and 9 million related to construction in progress assets at identified U.S. locations. 
 (2) 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred 79 million of charges consisting primarily of one-time employee severance and benefit costs associated with the January 2024 workforce reductions. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred 65 million of charges consisting primarily of one-time employee severance and benefit costs associated with the January 2023 workforce reductions. 
 (3) 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a 100 million gain on debt extinguishment upon repurchase of 83 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2024 Notes and 535 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2025 Notes. 
 
 Free Cash Flow 
 We calculate Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by or used in operating activities less Capital Expenditures. We have provided a reconciliation below of Free Cash Flow to net cash provided by or used in operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. 
 We disclose Free Cash Flow because it is an important indicator of our business performance as it measures the amount of cash we generate. Accordingly, we believe that Free Cash Flow provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management. 
 Free Cash Flow has limitations as an analytical tool because it omits certain components of the cash flow statement and does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Further, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Free Cash Flow differently. Accordingly, you should not consider Free Cash Flow in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because of these limitations, you should consider Free Cash Flow alongside other financial performance measures, including net cash provided by or used in operating activities, Capital Expenditures, and our other GAAP results.

 The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash provided by or used in operating activities to Free Cash Flow for each of the periods indicated: Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities 49 121 155 191 Purchase of property and equipment (17) (30) (53) (101) Site and software development costs (41) (49) (121) (154) Free Cash Flow (9) 42 (19) (64) 
 Adjusted Diluted Earnings or Loss per Share 
 We calculate Adjusted Diluted Earnings or Loss per Share as net income or loss plus equity-based compensation and related taxes, provision or benefit for income taxes, net, non-recurring items, other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, and, if dilutive, interest expense associated with convertible debt instruments under the if-converted method divided by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock used in the computation of diluted earnings or loss per share. Accordingly, we believe that these adjustments to our adjusted diluted net income or loss before calculating per share amounts for all periods presented provide a more meaningful comparison between our operating results from period to period. 
 Adjusted Diluted Earnings or Loss per Share has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. For example, Adjusted Diluted Earnings or Loss per Share, by their nature, excludes equity-based compensation and related taxes, provision or benefit for income taxes, net, non-recurring items, other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, and, if dilutive, interest expense associated with convertible debt instruments under the if-converted method. 
 Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted Diluted Earnings or Loss per Share alongside other financial performance measures.

 Net Revenue Constant Currency Growth 
 We calculate Net Revenue Constant Currency Growth by translating the current period local currency net revenue by the currency exchange rates used to translate our financial statements in the comparable prior-year period. 
 We disclose Net Revenue Constant Currency Growth because it is an important indicator of our operating results. Accordingly, we believe that Net Revenue Constant Currency Growth provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating trends in our operating results in the same manner as our management. 
 Net Revenue Constant Currency Growth has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. For example, Net Revenue Constant Currency Growth rates, by their nature, exclude the impact of foreign exchange, which may have a material impact on net revenue.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, net revenue, costs and expenses and related disclosures. Accordingly, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates since December 31, 2023. See Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a description of our critical accounting policies and estimates. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 The information called for by this section is incorporated herein by reference to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements, in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 There have been no significant changes in our exposures to market risk since December 31, 2023. See Part II, Item 7A, Q uantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a discussion on our exposures to market risk. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, we are involved in litigation matters and other legal claims that arise during the ordinary course of business. Litigation and legal claims are inherently unpredictable and cannot be predicted with certainty. An unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition, and regardless of the outcome, these matters can be costly and time consuming, as it can divert management's attention from important business matters and initiatives, negatively impacting our overall operations. In addition, we may be at greater risk to outside party claims as we increase our operations in jurisdictions where the laws with respect to the potential liability of online retailers are uncertain, unfavorable or unclear. 
 We do not believe that the outcome of any legal matters to which we are presently a party will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
