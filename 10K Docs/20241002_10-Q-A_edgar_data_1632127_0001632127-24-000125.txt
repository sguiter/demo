 EXPLANATORY NOTE 
 This Amendment No. 1 to the Cable One, Inc. Cable One, us, our, we or the Company Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A Form 10-Q/A or Amended Second Quarter 2024 Quarterly Report amends and restates certain information included in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on August 2, 2024 (the Original Second Quarter 2024 Quarterly Report ). The Company's consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 have been restated within an amended Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on October 1, 2024 (the 2023 Form 10-K/A and the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2024 have been restated within an amended Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A for the period ended March 31, 2024. All material restatement information will be included in the amended reports, and we do not intend to separately amend other filings that we have previously filed with the SEC. 
 As previously announced in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on September 24, 2024, subsequent to the issuance of the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company identified an error in the equity method accounting for its partial ownership of Clearwave Fiber LLC, a joint venture in which the Company contributed certain fiber operations (including certain fiber assets of Hargray (as defined under Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and a majority of the operations of Delta Communications, L.L.C.) and certain unaffiliated third-party investors contributed cash to a newly formed entity Clearwave Fiber ). Specifically, the Company did not appropriately allocate the losses generated by Clearwave Fiber amongst the joint venture partners after considering the liquidation preference and preferred return feature of the equity units held by the third-party investors. 
 As a result, equity method investment loss was understated, income tax provision was overstated and net income was overstated in the Company's consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the periods described below, which had a corresponding impact on the related consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of stockholders' equity items. There was no impact to the Company s consolidated statement of cash flows except for the presentation of net income offset by the respective adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities. Additionally, there was no impact to the Company's previously reported revenues, capital expenditures, cash flows from operating activities or Adjusted EBITDA (as defined and described in "Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations - Use of Adjusted EBITDA" ). 
 On September 23, 2024, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the Audit Committee ), in consultation with management, concluded that the following previously issued consolidated financial statements and other information of the Company should no longer be relied upon: 
 the audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 contained within the Annual Reports on Form 10-K for such years (and the associated audit report of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm); and 
 the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained within the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended June 30, 2022, September 30, 2022, March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023, September 30, 2023, March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024. 
 Items Amended in this Filing 
 This Amended Second Quarter 2024 Quarterly Report sets forth the Company's Original Second Quarter 2024 Quarterly Report, as amended, in its entirety. Except as required to reflect the restated amounts, related disclosures and updates to the Company's assessment of internal control over financial reporting ("ICFR") and disclosure controls and procedures ("DCPs"), there were no changes to any other parts of the Original Second Quarter 2024 Quarterly Report, and this Amended Second Quarter 2024 Quarterly Report does not reflect events occurring after the date of the Original Second Quarter 2024 Quarterly Report. Unless otherwise noted, references herein such as as of the date of this Quarterly Report refer to August 2, 2024, the original filing date of the Original Second Quarter 2024 Quarterly Report.

Specifically, there was a lack of an effectively designed control activity related to the evaluation of the capital structure of equity method investments when determining the proportionate share of earnings or losses to recognize. See Part 1, Item 4. Controls and Procedures.

 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Amended Second Quarter 2024 Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections about our industry, business, strategy, acquisitions and strategic investments, market expansion plans, announced organizational changes, dividend policy, capital allocation, financing strategy, ability to fund the purchase price payable if the put option associated with the remaining equity interests in Mega Broadband Investments Holdings LLC MBI is exercised, financial results and financial condition. Forward-looking statements often include words such as will, should, anticipates, estimates, expects, projects, intends, plans, believes and words and terms of similar substance in connection with discussions of future operating or financial performance. As with any projection or forecast, forward-looking statements are inherently susceptible to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Our actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on any forward-looking statement made by us or on our behalf. Important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements include government regulation, economic, strategic, political and social conditions and the following factors, which are discussed in our 2023 Form 10-K/A: 
 rising levels of competition from historical and new entrants in our markets;

 our ability to continue to grow our residential data and business data revenues and customer base; 
 increases in programming costs and retransmission fees;

 the integrity and security of our network and information systems; 
 the impact of possible security breaches and other disruptions, including cyber-attacks; 
 our failure to obtain necessary intellectual and proprietary rights to operate our business and the risk of intellectual property claims and litigation against us; 
 risks related to the restatement of our consolidated financial statements included in our 2023 Form 10-K/A and for other periods impacted by the restatement identified in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on September 24, 2024, and any potential litigation or investigation related to such restatement; 
 our ability to maintain effective ICFR and DCPs, including our ability to remediate any existing material weakness in our ICFR and the timing of any such remediation, as well as our ability to reestablish effective DCPs; 
 legislative or regulatory efforts to impose network neutrality and other new requirements on our data services; 
 additional regulation of our video and voice services; 
 our ability to renew cable system franchises; 
 increases in pole attachment costs; 
 changes in local governmental franchising authority and broadcast carriage regulations; 
 changes in government subsidy programs; 
 the potential adverse effect of our level of indebtedness on our business, financial condition or results of operations and cash flows; 
 the restrictions the terms of our indebtedness place on our business and corporate actions; 
 the possibility that interest rates will continue to rise, causing our obligations to service our variable rate indebtedness to increase significantly; 
 risks associated with our convertible indebtedness; 
 our ability to continue to pay dividends; 
 provisions in our charter, by-laws and Delaware law that could discourage takeovers and limit the judicial forum for certain disputes; 
 adverse economic conditions, labor shortages, supply chain disruptions, changes in rates of inflation and the level of move activity in the housing sector; 
 pandemics, epidemics or disease outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have, and may in the future, disrupt our business and operations, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows; 
 lower demand for our residential data and business data products; 
 fluctuations in our stock price; 
 dilution from equity awards, convertible indebtedness and potential future convertible debt and stock issuances; 
 damage to our reputation or brand image; 
 our ability to retain key employees (whom we refer to as associates); 
 our ability to incur future indebtedness; 
 provisions in our charter that could limit the liabilities for directors; and 
 the other risks and uncertainties detailed from time to time in our filings with the SEC, including but not limited to those described under " Risk Factors " in our 2023 Form 10-K/A. 
 Any forward-looking statements made by us in this document speak only as of the date on which they are made. We are under no obligation, and expressly disclaim any obligation, except as required by law, to update or alter our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events or otherwise.

The Revolving Credit Facility also gives the Company the ability to issue letters of credit, which reduce the amount available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 On February 22, 2023, the Company entered into the fourth amended and restated credit agreement with its lenders to amend and restate the Credit Agreement (as amended and restated, the "New Credit Agreement") to, among other things, (i) increase the aggregate principal amount of commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by million to billion; (ii) extend the scheduled maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility from October 2025 to February 2028; (iii) upsize the outstanding principal amount under the Term Loan B-3 by million to million (the "TLB-3 Upsize"); (iv) extend the scheduled maturities of the Term Loan B-2 and the Term Loan B-3 from October 2027 to October 2029 (subject to adjustment as described in the notes to the table below summarizing the Company's outstanding term loans as of June 30, 2024); (v) increase the fixed spreads on the Term Loan B-2 and the Term Loan B-3 from to ; and (vi) transition the benchmark interest rate for the Revolving Credit Facility, the Term Loan B-2 and the Term Loan B-3 from LIBOR to SOFR plus a basis point credit spread adjustment. Except as described above, the New Credit Agreement did not make any material changes to the principal terms of the Term Loan B-2, the Term Loan B-3, the Term Loan B-4 or the Revolving Credit Facility. Upon the effectiveness of the New Credit Agreement, the Company drew million under the Revolving Credit Facility and, together with the net proceeds from the TLB-3 Upsize, repaid all million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding Term Loan A-2. In July 2023, the Company transitioned the benchmark interest rate for the Term Loan B-4 from LIBOR to SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment that ranges from approximately basis points to basis points based on the interest period elected. 
 As of June 30, 2024, the interest margins applicable to the Senior Credit Facilities are, at the Company s option, equal to either SOFR or a base rate, plus an applicable margin equal to, (i) with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility, to plus a basis point credit spread adjustment for SOFR loans and to for base rate loans, determined on a quarterly basis by reference to a pricing grid based on the Company s Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the New Credit Agreement), (ii) with respect to the Term Loan B-2 and the Term Loan B-3, plus a basis point credit spread adjustment for SOFR loans and for base rate loans and (iii) with respect to the Term Loan B-4, plus an approximately to basis point credit spread adjustment based on the interest period elected for SOFR loans and for base rate loans. 
 The Company repaid million of the outstanding Revolving Credit Facility borrowings during 2023. In each of February 2024 and April 2024, the Company repaid million of the outstanding Revolving Credit Facility borrowings, reducing the outstanding balance to million as of June 30, 2024.

 Money market investments are held primarily in U.S. Treasury securities and registered money market funds and are valued using a market approach based on quoted market prices (level 1). Money market investments with original maturities of three months or less are included within cash and cash equivalents in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Interest rate swaps are measured at fair value within the condensed consolidated balance sheets on a recurring basis, with fair value determined using standard valuation models with assumptions about interest rates being based on those observed in underlying markets (level 2). The fair value of the term loans, Revolving Credit Facility, Senior Notes and Convertible Notes are estimated based on market prices for similar instruments in active markets (level 2). The fair value of the MBI Net Option is measured using Monte Carlo simulations that use inputs considered unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement (level 3).

 The Company regularly evaluates each of the assumptions used in establishing the fair value of the MBI Net Option. Significant changes in any of these assumptions could result in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement. A change in one of these assumptions is not necessarily accompanied by a change in another assumption. Refer to note 4 for further information on the MBI Net Option. 
 The carrying amounts of accounts receivable, accounts payable and other financial assets and liabilities approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments.

 Overview 
 We are a leading broadband communications provider committed to connecting customers and communities to what matters most. We strive to deliver an effortless experience by offering solutions that make our customers lives easier, and by relating to them personally as our neighbors and local business partners. Powered by our fiber-rich infrastructure, the Cable One family of brands provides residential customers with a wide array of connectivity and entertainment services, including Gigabit speeds, advanced Wi-Fi and video. For businesses ranging from small and mid-market up to enterprise, wholesale and carrier, we offer scalable, cost-effective solutions that enable businesses of all sizes to grow, compete and succeed. We believe the services we provide are critical to the development of new businesses and drive economic growth in the non-metropolitan, secondary and tertiary markets that we serve in 24 Western, Midwestern and Southern states. As of June 30, 2024, approximately 74 of our customers were located in seven states: Arizona, Idaho, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Texas. We provided services to approximately 1.1 million residential and business customers out of approximately 2.8 million homes passed as of June 30, 2024. Of these customers, approximately 1,063,000 subscribed to data services, 126,000 subscribed to video services and 112,000 subscribed to voice services. 
 We generate substantially all of our revenues through three primary product lines. Ranked by share of our total revenues through the first six months of 2024, they are residential data (58.4 ), residential video (14.7 and business data (14.2 ). The profit margins, growth rates and/or capital intensity of these three primary product lines vary significantly due to competition, product maturity and relative costs. 
 We focus on growing our higher margin businesses, namely residential data and business data services. Our strategy acknowledges the industry-wide trends of declining profitability of video services and declining revenues from residential voice services. The declining profitability of video services is due primarily to increasing programming costs and retransmission fees and competition from other streaming content providers, and the declining revenues from residential voice services are due primarily to the increasing use of wireless voice services instead of residential voice services. Separately, we have also historically focused on retaining customers who are likely to produce higher relative value over the life of their service relationships with us, are less attracted by discounting, require less support and churn less. This strategy has focused on increasing Adjusted EBITDA, driving higher margins and delivering attractive levels of Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures over the long-term.

 Excluding the effects of our recently completed and any potential future acquisitions and divestitures, the trends described above have impacted, and are expected to further impact, our three primary product lines in the following ways: 
 Residential data . We have experienced significant growth in residential data customers and revenues since 2013 and we expect growth for this product line to continue over the long-term. We believe upgrades made in our broadband capacity, our ability to offer higher access speeds than many of our competitors, the reliability and flexibility of our data service offerings, our Wi-Fi support service and continuously growing data usage by consumers and their demand for higher speeds will enable us to continue to grow average monthly revenue per unit ("ARPU") from our existing customers over the long-term and capture additional market share. Our broadband plant generally consists of a fiber-to-the-premises or hybrid fiber-coaxial network with ample unused capacity, and we offer our data customers internet products at some of the fastest speeds available in our markets. We believe that the capacity and reliability of our networks exceeds that of our competitors in most of our markets and best positions us to meet the continuously increasing consumption demands of customers. We experienced elevated growth in residential data revenues during the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has subsided in recent quarters due in part to macroeconomic headwinds and competition in certain areas of our footprint. 
 Residential video. Residential video service is an increasingly fragmented business, with programming costs and retransmission fees continuing to escalate in the face of a proliferation of streaming content alternatives. We intend to continue our strategy of focusing on the higher-margin businesses of residential data and business data while de-emphasizing our video business. As a result of our video strategy, we expect that residential video customers and revenues will continue to decline. We offer Sparklight TV, an internet protocol-based ("IPTV") video service that allows customers with our Sparklight TV app to stream our video channels from the cloud. This transition from linear to IPTV video service enables us to reclaim bandwidth, freeing up network capacity to increase data speeds and capacity across our network. 
 Business data . We have experienced significant growth in business data customers and revenues since 2013. We attribute this growth to our strategic focus on increasing sales to business customers and our efforts to attract enterprise business customers. We expect to experience continued growth in business data customers and revenues over the long-term. Margins for products sold to business customers have remained attractive, which we expect will continue. 
 We continue to experience increased competition, particularly from telephone companies; fiber, municipal and cooperative overbuilders; fixed wireless access data providers; and over-the-top video providers. Because of the levels of competition we face, we believe it is important to make investments in our infrastructure. In addition, a key objective of our capital allocation process is to invest in initiatives designed to drive revenue and Adjusted EBITDA expansion. We continue to invest capital to, among other things, increase fiber density and coverage, expand our footprint, increase plant and data capacity, enhance network reliability and improve the customer experience. We have rolled out multi-Gigabit download data service to certain markets and currently offer Gigabit download data service to nearly all of our homes passed. We have deployed DOCSIS 3.1, which, together with Sparklight TV, further increases our network capacity and enables future growth in our residential data and business data product lines. 
 We expect to continue to devote financial resources to infrastructure improvements in existing and newly acquired markets as well as to expand high-speed data service in areas adjacent to our existing network. We believe these investments are necessary to continually meet our customers needs and remain competitive. The capital enhancements associated with acquisitions include rebuilding low-capacity markets; reclaiming bandwidth from analog video services; implementing 32-channel bonding; deploying DOCSIS 4.0; consolidating back office functions such as billing, accounting and service provisioning; migrating products to Cable One platforms; and expanding our high-capacity fiber network. 
 Our primary goals are to continue growing residential data and business data revenues, to increase profit margins and to deliver strong Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures over the long-term. To achieve these goals, we intend to continue our disciplined cost management approach, remain focused on customers with expected higher relative value, supplement our growth by targeting a broader scope of incremental customers, including those who are more value-conscious, combat competitive threats in our markets through more targeted pricing and product offerings and follow through with further planned investments in broadband plant upgrades, including the deployment of DOCSIS 4.0 capabilities and new data service offerings for residential and business customers. We also plan to seek broadband-related acquisition and strategic investment opportunities in rural markets in addition to the pursuit of organic growth through market expansion projects. Given our strategic focus on our higher margin residential data and business data product lines, we assess our level of capital expenditures relative to Adjusted EBITDA, unlike others in our industry who may compare their capital expenditures to revenues due to their much larger video customer bases.

 In recent years, we have made investments in several broadband-centric providers serving non-urban markets that follow various strategies similar to our own. Such strategic investments capitalize on opportunities that may not have existed under a full ownership model, allow us to participate more aggressively in the fiber expansion business and may potentially provide future acquisition or investment opportunities, while allowing our management team to focus on our core business and without burdening our cash flow. 
 
 The FCC's Affordable Connectivity Program 
 In 2021, we participated in the FCC s Emergency Broadband Benefit EBB program, which provided qualifying low-income consumers a discount on certain of our broadband internet access services for which we received reimbursement from the FCC. On December 31, 2021, the EBB program transitioned to the Affordable Connectivity Program ACP as required by the Infrastructure Act. The ACP allowed us to seek reimbursement for certain broadband internet access service discounts provided to qualifying low-income consumers. The funding for the ACP authorized under the Infrastructure Act has been depleted and the program ended in the second quarter of 2024. While only a relatively small percentage of our customers received ACP services, the termination of the program could affect the profitability of our residential data services and will result in the loss of residential data customers. We lost approximately 4,000 residential data customers who received ACP services during the second quarter of 2024. 
 For additional information, see Risk Factors Risks Relating to Our Business Changes in or elimination of the FCC s Affordable Connectivity Program could affect the profitability of our data services in Part I, Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K/A .

 In recent years, our customer mix has shifted away from double- and triple-play packages combining data, video and/or voice services, which is in line with our strategy of focusing on our higher margin residential data and business data product lines. This is largely because some video customers have defected to direct broadcast satellite services and over-the-top offerings and households continue to discontinue residential voice services. In addition, we have focused on selling data-only packages to new customers rather than cross-selling video to these customers.

 Use of Nonfinancial Metrics and ARPU 
 We use various nonfinancial metrics to measure, manage and monitor our operating performance on an ongoing basis. Such metrics include homes passed, PSUs and customer relationships. Homes passed represents the number of serviceable and marketable homes and businesses passed by our active plant. A PSU represents a single subscription to a particular service offering. Residential bulk multi-dwelling PSUs are generally classified as residential and are counted at the individual unit level. Business voice customers who have multiple voice lines are counted as a single PSU. A customer relationship represents a single customer who subscribes to one or more PSUs. 
 We believe homes passed, PSUs and customer relationship counts are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance. Similar measures with similar titles are common measures used by investors, analysts and peers to compare performance in our industry, although our measures of homes passed, PSUs and customer relationships may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 
 We use ARPU to evaluate and monitor the amount of revenue generated by each type of service subscribed to by customers and the contribution to total revenues as well as to analyze and compare growth patterns. Residential ARPU values represent the applicable residential service revenues (excluding installation and activation fees) divided by the corresponding average of the number of PSUs at the beginning and end of each period, divided by the number of months in the period, except that for any PSUs added or subtracted as a result of an acquisition or divestiture occurring during the period, the associated ARPU values represent the applicable residential service revenues (excluding installation and activation fees) divided by the pro-rated average number of PSUs during such period. Business services ARPU values represent business services revenues divided by the average of the number of business customer relationships at the beginning and end of each period, divided by the number of months in the period, except that for any business customer relationships added or subtracted as a result of an acquisition or divestiture occurring during the period, the associated ARPU values represent business services revenues divided by the pro-rated average number of business customer relationships during such period. 
 We believe ARPU is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance. ARPU and similar measures with similar titles are common measures used by investors, analysts and peers to compare performance in our industry, although our measure of ARPU may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

 Costs and Expenses 
 Operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) were 105.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and decreased 7.0 million, or 6.2 , compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily attributable to 8.5 million of lower programming costs as a result of video customer losses and a 2.3 million decrease in labor and other compensation-related costs due in part to certain organizational changes implemented during the second quarter of 2024. These decreases were partially offset by higher health insurance costs, network backbone costs and property and other taxes. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 26.8 and 26.6 for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses were 90.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and increased 4.6 million, or 5.3 , compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses w as primarily attributabl e to 5.5 million of severance costs due to recent organizational changes and 1.2 million of system conversion costs that did not occur in the prior year, partially offset by lower professional services costs and rent expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 23.0 and 20.3 for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense was 85.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and decreased 1.9 million, or 2.2 , compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023.

 Interest expense, net, was 35.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and decreased 3.8 million, or 9.7 , compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest expense was due primarily to lower outstanding debt balances and higher interest and investment income. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Other expense, net, was 0.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and consisted primarily of an 8.4 million non-cash loss on fair value adjustment associated with the MBI Net Option, partially offset by a 7.7 million gain related to the C-band spectrum relocation funding received from the federal government. Other expense , net, was 6.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and consisted primarily of a 6.8 million non-cash loss on fair value adjustment associated with the MBI Net Option. 
 Income Tax Provision (As Restated) 
 Income tax provision was 14.1 million and 16.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and our effective tax rate was 18.9 and 18.7 for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was due primarily to a decrease in income tax benefits of 1.7 million resulting from lower equity method investment net losses in the current quarter, partially offset by income tax benefits of 0.6 million resulting from a decrease in state income tax rates enacted during the current quarter. 
 Equity Method Investment Income (Loss), Net (As Restated) 
 Equity method investment loss was 22.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and consisted of our 21.1 million and 1.3 million proportionate share of net losses from our Clearwave Fiber and MBI investments, respectively.

 Use of Adjusted EBITDA (As Restated) 
 We use certain measures that are not defined by GAAP to evaluate various aspects of our business. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and should be considered in addition to, not as superior to, or as a substitute for, net income reported in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is reconciled to net income below, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income plus net interest expense, income tax provision, depreciation and amortization, equity-based compensation, severance and contract termination costs, acquisition-related costs, net (gain) loss on asset sales and disposals, system conversion costs, rebranding costs, net equity method investment (income) loss, net other (income) expense and any special items, as provided in the reconciliation tables below. As such, it eliminates the significant non-cash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of our business as well as other non-cash or special items and is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities. This measure is limited in that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues and our cash cost of debt financing. These costs are evaluated through other financial measures. 
 We use Adjusted EBITDA to assess our performance. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA generally correlates to the measure used in the leverage ratio calculations under the New Credit Agreement and the Senior Notes Indenture to determine compliance with the covenants contained in the New Credit Agreement and the ability to take certain actions under the Senior Notes Indenture. Adjusted EBITDA is also a significant performance measure that we have used in connection with our incentive compensation programs. Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account cash used for mandatory debt service requirements or other non-discretionary expenditures, and thus does not represent residual funds available for discretionary uses. 
 We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures with similar titles are common measures used by investors, analysts and peers to compare performance in our industry, although our measure of Adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

 Financial Condition: Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Liquidity 
 Our primary funding requirements are for our ongoing operations, capital expenditures, potential acquisitions and strategic investments, payments of quarterly dividends and share repurchases. We believe that our existing cash balances, our Senior Credit Facilities and operating cash flows will provide adequate support for these funding requirements over the next 12 months. However, our ability to utilize those funding sources to fund ongoing operations, make capital expenditures, make future acquisitions and strategic investments, pay quarterly dividends and make share repurchases depends on future operating performance and cash flows, which, in turn, are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. 
 As part of our 45 minority equity interest in MBI, we acquired the right, but not the obligation, to purchase all but not less than all of the remaining equity interests in MBI that we do not already own if we so elect between January 1, 2023 and June 30, 2024 (the "Call Option"). We did not elect to exercise the Call Option. Investors affiliated with GTCR LLC, a private equity firm based in Chicago, have the right, but not the obligation, to sell (and to cause all members of MBI other than us to sell) to us and, in such case, we are obligated to purchase all but not less than all of the direct and indirect equity interests in MBI that we do not already own, pursuant to such right which may be exercised between July 1, 2025 through September 30, 2025 (the "Put Option"). The purchase price payable upon the exercise of the Put Option, if applicable, will be calculated under a formula based on a multiple of MBI s adjusted EBITDA as specified in the definitive documentation governing our investment in MBI. If the Put Option is exercised, we expect the transaction would be consummated within three to nine months thereafter, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. We believe that our existing cash balances, the anticipated available capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility at the time of the transaction and our operating cash flows will be sufficient to fund the purchase price payable if the Put Option is exercised without needing to raise additional incremental capital. However, we may also opportunistically pursue additional incremental financing transactions depending on market conditions and other factors.

 The following table shows a summary of our net cash flows for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands): 
 Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 vs. 2023 2024 2023 Change Change Net cash provided by operating activities 320,298 331,351 (11,053) (3.3) Net cash used in investing activities (162,738) (199,530) 36,792 (18.4) Net cash used in financing activities (146,331) (186,237) 39,906 (21.4) Change in cash and cash equivalents 11,229 (54,416) 65,645 (120.6) Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 190,289 215,150 (24,861) (11.6) Cash and cash equivalents, end of period 201,518 160,734 40,784 25.4 
 The 11.1 million year-over-year decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to a decrease in Adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by favorable changes in working capital. 
 The 36.8 million year-over-year decrease in net cash used in investing activities was due primarily to a 40.4 million decrease in cash paid for capital expenditures and a 2.3 million increase in proceeds from the sale of assets during the first half of 2024. 
 The 39.9 million year-over-year decrease in net cash used in financing activities was due primarily to payments of 83.1 million for share repurchases and 8.1 million for debt issuance costs during the first half of 2023 that did not recur, partially offset by a 49.8 million increase in net debt repayments. 
 On May 20, 2022, our Board authorized up to 450.0 million of share repurchases (with no cap as to the number of shares of common stock). We had 143.1 million of remaining share repurchase authorization under the Share Repurchase Program as of June 30, 2024. Additional purchases under the Share Repurchase Program may be made from time to time on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions. The size and timing of these purchases are based on a number of factors, including share price and business and market conditions. Since we first became publicly traded in 2015 through June 30, 2024, we have repurchased 646,244 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of 556.9 million. We may, from time to time, continue to opportunistically repurchase shares depending on the trading price of our common stock, market conditions and other factors. We did not repurchase any shares during the six months ended June 30, 2024. 
 We currently expect to continue to pay comparable quarterly cash dividends on shares of our common stock, subject to approval of the Board. During the second quarter of 2024, the Board approved a quarterly dividend of 2.95 per share of common stock, which was paid on June 14, 2024, resulting in a total dividend distribution of 17.1 million. 
 
 Financing Activity 
 Senior Credit Facilities 
 Prior to February 22, 2023, the Credit Agreement provided for the Term Loan A-2, the Term Loan B-2, the Term Loan B-3, the Term Loan B-4 and the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility gives us the ability to issue letters of credit, which reduce the amount available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 On February 22, 2023, we amended and restated the Credit Agreement to, among other things, (i) increase the aggregate principal amount of commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by 500.0 million to 1.0 billion; (ii) extend the scheduled maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility from October 2025 to February 2028; (iii) upsize the outstanding principal amount under the Term Loan B-3 by 150.0 million to 757.0 million; (iv) extend the scheduled maturities of the Term Loan B-2 and the Term Loan B-3 from October 2027 to October 2029 (subject to adjustment as described in the notes to the table below summarizing our outstanding term loans as of June 30, 2024); (v) increase the fixed spreads on the Term Loan B-2 and the Term Loan B-3 from 2.00 to 2.25 ; and (vi) transition the benchmark interest rate for the Revolving Credit Facility, the Term Loan B-2 and the Term Loan B-3 from LIBOR to SOFR plus a 10 basis point credit spread adjustment. Except as described above, the New Credit Agreement did not make any material changes to the principal terms of the Term Loan B-2, the Term Loan B-3, the Term Loan B-4 or the Revolving Credit Facility. Upon the effectiveness of the New Credit Agreement, we drew 488.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility and, together with the net proceeds from the TLB-3 Upsize, repaid all 638.3 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding Term Loan A-2. In July 2023, we transitioned the benchmark interest rate for the Term Loan B-4 from LIBOR to SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment that ranges from approximately 11.4 basis points to 42.8 basis points based on the interest period elected.

Table of Contents 

 As of June 30, 2024, the interest margins applicable to the Senior Credit Facilities are, at our option, equal to either SOFR or a base rate, plus an applicable margin equal to, (i) with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility, 1.25 to 1.75 plus a 10 basis point credit spread adjustment for SOFR loans and 0.25 to 0.75 for base rate loans, determined on a quarterly basis by reference to a pricing grid based on our Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the New Credit Agreement), (ii) with respect to the Term Loan B-2 and the Term Loan B-3, 2.25 plus a 10 basis point credit spread adjustment for SOFR loans and 1.25 for base rate loans and (iii) with respect to the Term Loan B-4, 2.0 plus an approximately 11.4 to 42.8 basis point credit spread adjustment based on the interest period elected for SOFR loans and 1.0 for base rate loans. 
 We repaid 150.0 million of the outstanding Revolving Credit Facility borrowings during 2023. In each of February 2024 and April 2024, we repaid 50.0 million of the outstanding Revolving Credit Facility borrowings, reducing the outstanding balance to 238.0 million. In July 2024, we repaid an additional 50.0 million of the outstanding Revolving Credit Facility borrowings. 
 As of June 30, 2024, we had approximately 1.76 billion of aggregate outstanding term loans and 238.0 million of borrowings (and 762.0 million available for borrowing) under the Revolving Credit Facility. A summary of our outstanding term loans as of June 30, 2024 is as follows (dollars in thousands):

 (1) Payable in equal quarterly installments (expressed as a percentage of the original principal amount and subject to customary adjustments in the event of any prepayment). All loans may be prepaid at any time without penalty or premium (subject to customary SOFR breakage provisions). 
 (2) The final maturity date of the Term Loan B-2 and the Term Loan B-3, in each case, will adjust to May 3, 2028 if greater than 150.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Term Loan B-4 (together with any refinancing indebtedness in respect of the Term Loan B-4 with a final maturity date prior to the date that is 91 days after October 30, 2029) remains outstanding on May 3, 2028. 
 Senior Notes 
 In November 2020, we completed the offering of 650.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2030. The Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.00 per annum payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15th and November 15th of each year. The Senior Notes are required to be guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of our existing and future wholly owned domestic subsidiaries that guarantees our obligations under our New Credit Agreement or that guarantees certain capital markets debt of ours or a guarantor in an aggregate principal amount in excess of 250.0 million. 
 Convertible Notes 
 In March 2021, we completed the Convertible Notes offering of 575.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2026 Notes and 345.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2028 Notes. The Convertible Notes are senior unsecured obligations of ours and are guaranteed by our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries that guarantee the Senior Credit Facilities or that guarantee certain of our Notes in an aggregate principal amount in excess of 250.0 million. The 2026 Notes do not bear regular interest, and the principal amount of the 2026 Notes do not accrete. The 2028 Notes bear interest at a rate of 1.125 per annum. Interest on the 2028 Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on March 15th and September 15th of each year, unless earlier repurchased, converted or redeemed. The 2026 Notes are scheduled to mature on March 15, 2026, and the 2028 Notes are scheduled to mature on March 15, 2028. The initial conversion rate for each of the 2026 Notes and the 2028 Notes is 0.4394 shares of our common stock per 1,000 principal amount of 2026 Notes and 2028 Notes, as applicable (equivalent to an initial conversion price of 2,275.83 per share of common stock). The initial conversion price of each of the 2026 Notes and the 2028 Notes represents a premium of 25.0 over the last reported sale price of 1,820.83 per share of our common stock on March 2, 2021. The Convertible Notes are convertible at the option of the holders. The method of conversion into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof is at our election.

 We have entered into a letter of credit agreement with MUFG which provides for an additional 75.0 million of letter of credit issuing capacity, of which 10.6 million was utilized as of June 30, 2024. 
 We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of June 30, 2024. 
 We are party to two interest rate swap agreements to convert our interest payment obligations with respect to an aggregate of 1.2 billion of our variable rate SOFR indebtedness to a fixed rate. Under the first swap agreement, with respect to a notional amount of 850.0 million, our monthly payment obligation is determined at a fixed base rate of 2.595 . Under the second swap agreement, with respect to a notional amount of 350.0 million, our monthly payment obligation is determined at a fixed base rate of 2.691 . Both interest rate swap agreements are scheduled to mature in the first quarter of 2029 but each may be terminated prior to the scheduled maturity at our election or that of the financial institution counterparty under the terms provided in each swap agreement. We recognized income of 8.2 million and 7.2 million on interest rate swaps during the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and income of 16.4 million and 12.8 million on interest rate swaps during the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which were reflected within interest expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. 
 Refer to notes 11 and 13 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in the 2023 Form 10-K/A and notes 7 and 8 to the condensed consolidated financial statements in this Amended Second Quarter 2024 Quarterly Report for further details regarding our financing activity, outstanding debt and interest rate swaps.

 Capital Expenditures 
 We have significant ongoing capital expenditure requirements as well as capital enhancements associated with acquired operations and the expansion of our high-capacity network. We are entering the final year of capital enhancements associated with acquired operations, which has been focused on upgrading any remaining low-capacity markets and migrating products and billing systems to Cable One platforms. Capital expenditures are funded primarily by cash on hand and cash flows from operating activities. 
 Our capital expenditures by category for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (in thousands): 
 Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 2023 Customer premise equipment (1) 
 19,040 34,386 Commercial (2) 
 11,190 18,952 Scalable infrastructure (3)

 (1) Customer premise equipment includes costs incurred at customer locations, including installation costs and customer premise equipment (e.g., modems and set-top boxes). 
 (2) Commercial includes costs related to securing business services customers and PSUs, including small and medium-sized businesses and enterprise customers. 
 (3) Scalable infrastructure includes costs not related to customer premise equipment to secure growth of new customers and PSUs or provide service enhancements (e.g., headend equipment). 
 (4) Line extensions include network costs associated with entering new service areas (e.g., fiber/coaxial cable, amplifiers, electronic equipment, make-ready and design engineering). 
 (5) Upgrade/rebuild includes costs to modify or replace existing fiber/coaxial cable networks, including betterments. 
 (6) Support capital includes costs associated with the replacement or enhancement of non-network assets due to technological and physical obsolescence (e.g., non-network equipment, land, buildings and vehicles) and capitalized internal labor costs not associated with customer installation activities. 
 
 Contractual Obligations and Contingent Commitments 
 As of June 30, 2024, with the exception of debt payments (refer to note 7 of the condensed consolidated financial statements in this Amended Second Quarter 2024 Quarterly Report for the updated future maturities of outstanding borrowings table), there have been no material changes to the contractual obligations and contingent commitments previously disclosed in the 2023 Form 10-K/A. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or financing arrangements with special-purpose entities. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
 An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to our results of operations and financial condition and if it requires management s most difficult, subjective and complex judgments in its application. 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policy and estimate disclosures described in our 2023 Form 10-K/A.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and prices. There have been no material changes to the market risk disclosures described in the 2023 Form 10-K/A other than as set forth below. 
 As of June 30, 2024, we had 650.0 million, 575.0 million and 345.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes, 2026 Notes and 2028 Notes, respectively, outstanding. Although the Senior Notes and 2028 Notes are based on fixed rates and the 2026 Notes do not bear interest, changes in interest rates could impact the fair market value of such notes. As of June 30, 2024, the fair market values of the Senior Notes, 2026 Notes and 2028 Notes were 482.9 million, 507.4 million and 257.9 million, respectively. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate DCPs (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). DCPs are those controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. DCPs include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company carried out an evaluation as of June 30, 2024 of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s DCPs pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b). Based on the Company s evaluation at the time the Original Second Quarter 2024 Quarterly Report was filed, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer had concluded that the Company s DCPs were effective as of June 30, 2024. Subsequent to that evaluation and as a result of the material weakness in the Company's ICFR discussed below, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of June 30, 2024, the Company's DCPs were not effective in ensuring information required to be disclosed in the reports the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in ICFR, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 The Company did not design and maintain effective controls over its accounting for equity method investments. Specifically, it lacked an effectively designed control activity related to the evaluation of the capital structure of equity method investments when determining the proportionate share of earnings or losses to recognize. This material weakness resulted in the restatement of the Company's consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 as well as each of the interim periods within the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, excluding the first quarter of 2022, condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024. Additionally, this material weakness could result in misstatements of our equity method investments, proportionate share of earnings or losses and related accounts in our interim or annual consolidated financial statements and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement that would not be prevented or detected. 
 Remediation Plan for Material Weakness 
 Upon identification of the material weakness, management developed a remediation plan, which included designing and implementing a new control activity to fully evaluate the capital structures of equity method investments in its determination of the proportionate share of earnings or losses to recognize. Management believes these measures will remediate the identified material weakness. However, the material weakness will not be considered remediated until the remediation plan has been implemented and there has been sufficient time for the Company to conclude through testing that the controls are operating effectively. As the Company's management, under the oversight of the Audit Committee, continues to evaluate and improve the Company's ICFR, management may decide to take additional measures to address control deficiencies or determine to modify, or in appropriate circumstances not to complete, certain of the remediation measures identified.

The authorization does not have an expiration date. The Company had 143.1 million of remaining share repurchase authorization under the Share Repurchase Program as of June 30, 2024. Additional purchases under the Share Repurchase Program may be made from time to time on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions. The size and timing of these purchases are based on a number of factors, including share price and business and market conditions. 
 (2) Includes shares withheld from associates to satisfy estimated tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock and/or exercises of SARs under the Company's incentive compensation plans. The average price paid per share for the common stock withheld was based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the applicable vesting or exercise measurement date.
