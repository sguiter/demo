In connection with the first quarter 2024 realignment of the composition of of its reportable segments discussed in Note 1, Organization and Basis of Presentation, goodwill of million was reassigned from the Offshore Manufactured Products segment to the Downhole Technologies segment based on estimated relative fair values. The Company performed an interim quantitative assessment of goodwill recorded within the Offshore Manufactured Products segment as of February 29, 2024 (prior to realignment) which indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. 
 The Company also performed an interim quantitative assessment of goodwill transferred to the Downhole Technologies segment (subsequent to the realignment). This interim assessment indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying amount and the Company concluded that goodwill reassigned to the Downhole Technologies business was fully impaired. The Company therefore recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment charge totaling million in the first quarter of 2024. This impairment charge did not impact the Company s liquidity position, debt covenants or cash flows. 
 Management used a combination of valuation methodologies including the income approach and guideline public company comparables. The fair values of each of the Company s reporting units were determined using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 fair value measurements). The income approach estimates fair value by discounting the Company s forecasts of future cash flows by a discount rate (expected return) that a market participant is expected to require on its investment. 
 Significant assumptions and estimates used in the income approach include, among others, estimated future net annual cash flows and discount rates for each reporting unit, current and anticipated market conditions, estimated growth rates and historical data. These estimates rely upon significant management judgment. 
 Long-Lived Tangible and Intangible Assets 
 An assessment for impairment of long-lived tangible and intangible assets is conducted when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value of long-lived tangible and intangible assets may not be recoverable. In response to further reductions in customer activity in the United States during the third quarter of 2024, management made strategic decisions to exit its underperforming flowback and well testing service offering and sell the related equipment and inventory. Management also decided to exit leased facilities. As a result of these events and actions, the Company recorded non-cash intangible asset (customer relationships and tradenames) impairment charges of million associated with the exit of this service offering and operating lease impairments of million related to facility closures. Additionally, the equipment and inventory of the exited service offering in the Completion and Production Services segment was reclassified to assets held for sale, and transferred from property, plant and equipment and inventory to prepaid and other current assets. The carrying value of assets held for sale totaled million as of September 30, 2024.

 The ABL Agreement provides funding based on a borrowing base calculation that includes eligible U.S. customer accounts receivable and inventory and provides for a million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit. Borrowings under the ABL Agreement are secured by a pledge of substantially all of the Company s domestic assets (other than real property) and the stock of certain foreign subsidiaries. 
 Borrowings under the ABL Agreement bear interest at a rate equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (subject to a floor rate of plus a margin of to , or at a base rate plus a margin of to , in each case based on average borrowing availability. Quarterly, the Company must also pay a commitment fee of to per annum, based on unused commitments under the ABL Agreement. 
 The ABL Agreement places restrictions on the Company s ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens on assets, pay dividends or make distributions on equity interests, dispose of assets, make investments, repay other indebtedness (including the 2026 Notes discussed below), engage in mergers, and other matters, in each case, subject to certain exceptions. The ABL Agreement contains customary default provisions, which, if triggered, could result in acceleration of repayment of all amounts then outstanding. The ABL Agreement also requires the Company to satisfy and maintain a fixed charge coverage

 ITEM 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read together with our condensed consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K in order to understand factors, such as charges and credits, financing transactions and changes in tax regulations, which may impact comparability from period to period. 
 We provide a broad range of manufactured products and services to customers in the energy, industrial and military sectors through our Offshore Manufactured Products, Completion and Production Services (previously referred to as Well Site Services) and Downhole Technologies segments. In first quarter 2024, certain short-cycle, consumable product operations historically reported within the Offshore Manufactured Products segment (legacy frac plugs and elastomer products) were integrated into the Downhole Technologies segment to better align with the underlying activity demand drivers and current segment management structure, as well as provide for additional operational synergies. Historical financial data, supplemental disaggregated revenue and backlog information as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 (presented herein) was conformed with the 2024 segment presentation. Additionally, following the sale of its remaining U.S. land-based drilling rigs and the exit of the flowback and well testing service offering in the third quarter of 2024, our Well Site Services segment name was changed to the Completion and Production Services segment. 
 Demand for our products and services is cyclical and substantially dependent upon activity levels in the oil and gas industry, particularly our customers willingness to invest capital in the exploration for and development of crude oil and natural gas reserves. Our customers capital spending programs are generally based on their cash flows and their outlook for near-term and long-term commodity prices, making demand for our products and services sensitive to expectations regarding future crude oil and natural gas prices, as well as economic growth, commodity demand and estimates of resource production and regulatory pressures related to Environmental, Social and Governance ESG considerations.

 On February 16, 2024, we amended the ABL Facility (as defined below) to extend its maturity date from February 10, 2025 to February 16, 2028. 
 Certain short-cycle, consumable product operations historically reported within the Offshore Manufactured Products segment (legacy frac plugs and elastomer products) were integrated into our Downhole Technologies segment in the first quarter of 2024 to better align with the underlying activity demand drivers and current segment management structure, as well as provide for additional operational synergies. Historical segment financial data, backlog and other information were conformed with the 2024 segment presentation. Additionally, following the sale of its remaining U.S. land-based drilling rigs and the exit of the flowback and well testing service offering in the third quarter of 2024, the Company s Well Site Services segment name was changed to the Completion and Production Services segment. 
 In 2023, we began implementing initiatives, which are continuing into 2024, to reduce future costs. Management actions to-date in 2024 included: the consolidation, relocation and exit of certain underperforming locations; the exit of certain service offerings; reductions in our U.S. work force as well as the realignment of operations discussed above. We have also incurred legal and other related costs to enforce certain patents related to our proprietary technologies. As a result of these actions, our reported pre-tax results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included 23.4 million in non-cash goodwill, intangible and operating lease asset impairment charges as well as 11.8 million of facility consolidation and exit, patent defense and other charges. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our Offshore Manufactured Products segment sold a manufacturing and service facility that was classified as held for sale for net proceeds of 10.3 million, we purchased 11.5 million principal amount of our 2026 Notes (as defined below) for 10.8 million, and we purchased 5.5 million of our common stock. 
 On October 24, 2024, our Board of Directors terminated our existing common stock repurchase program and replaced it with a new 50.0 million common stock repurchase authorization which expires in October 2026. 
 On October 25, 2024, Brent crude oil, WTI crude oil and natural gas spot prices closed at 75.62 per barrel, 72.02 per barrel and 1.93 per MMBtu, respectively below the third quarter 2024 averages. Additionally, the U.S. drilling rig count reported on October 25, 2024 was 585 rigs comparable to the third quarter 2024 average. 
 Overview 
 Current and expected future pricing for WTI crude oil and natural gas and inflationary cost increases, along with expectations regarding the regulatory environment in the regions in which we operate, are factors that will continue to influence our customers willingness to invest capital in their businesses. Expectations for the longer-term price for Brent crude oil will continue to influence our customers spending related to global offshore drilling and development and, thus, a significant portion of the activity of our Offshore Manufactured Products segment. 
 Crude oil and natural gas prices and levels of demand for crude oil and natural gas are likely to remain highly volatile due to numerous factors, including: geopolitical conflicts in Europe and the Middle East, along with associated international tensions; the perceived risk of a global economic recession; the levels of domestic or international crude oil and natural gas production; changes in governmental rules and regulations; sanctions; the willingness of operators to invest capital in the

 exploration for and development of resources; use of alternative fuels; improved vehicle fuel efficiency; timing of capital investments in alternative energy sources; a more sustained movement to electric vehicles; and the potential for ongoing supply/demand imbalances. 
 U.S. drilling, completion and production activity and, in turn, our financial results, are sensitive to near-term fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly U.S. crude oil and natural gas prices, given the short-term, call-out nature of our U.S. operations. 
 Customer spending in the natural gas shale plays has moderated over the last ten years due to technological advancements that have led to significant amounts of natural gas being produced from prolific basins in the Northeastern United States and from associated gas produced from the drilling and completion of unconventional oil wells in the United States. 
 Our Offshore Manufactured Products segment provides technology-driven, highly-engineered products and services for offshore oil and natural gas production systems and facilities globally, as well as certain products and services to the offshore drilling and completion markets. This segment also produces a variety of products for use in industrial, military and other applications outside the traditional energy industry. Additionally, we are investing in research and product development (and have been awarded select contracts and are bidding on additional projects) to facilitate the development of alternative energy sources, including offshore wind and deepsea mineral gathering opportunities. This segment is particularly influenced by global spending on deepwater drilling and production, which is primarily driven by our customers longer-term commodity demand forecasts and outlook for crude oil and natural gas prices. Approximately 89 of Offshore Manufactured Products segment sales in the first nine months of 2024 were driven by our customers capital spending for products and services used in exploratory and developmental drilling, greenfield offshore production infrastructure, and subsea pipeline tie-in and repair system applications, along with upgraded equipment for existing offshore drilling rigs and other vessels (referred to herein as project-driven products and services ). Deepwater oil and gas development projects typically involve significant capital investments and multi-year development plans. Such projects are generally undertaken by larger exploration, field development and production companies (primarily international oil companies and state-run national oil companies) using relatively conservative crude oil and natural gas pricing assumptions. Given the long lead times associated with field development, we believe some of these deepwater projects, once approved for development, are generally less susceptible to change based on short-term fluctuations in the price of crude oil and natural gas. 
 Backlog reported by our Offshore Manufactured Products segment increased to 313 million as of September 30, 2024 from 300 million as of June 30, 2024. Bookings totaled 112 million in the third quarter of 2024, yielding a quarterly book-to-bill ratio of 1.1x (1.0x year-to-date). The following table sets forth backlog as of the dates indicated (in millions). 
 Backlog as of Year March 31 June 30 September 30 December 31 2024 305 300 313 2023 316 328 341 327 2022 255 232 248 300 
 Our Completion and Production Services segment provides completion and production services in the United States (including the Gulf of Mexico) and internationally. Prior to the sale of its drilling rigs in August of 2024, the segment also provided land drilling services in the United States. U.S. drilling and completion activity and, in turn, our Completion and Production Services results, are sensitive to near-term fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly WTI crude oil prices, given the short-term, call-out nature of its operations. We primarily supply equipment and service personnel utilized in the completion of, and initial production from, new and recompleted wells in our U.S. operations, which are dependent primarily upon the level and complexity of drilling, completion and workover activity in our areas of operations. Well intensity and complexity have increased with the continuing transition to multi-well pads, the drilling of longer lateral wells and increased downhole pressures, along with the increased number of frac stages completed in horizontal wells. 
 Our Downhole Technologies segment provides oil and gas perforation systems, downhole tools and services in support of completion, intervention, wireline and well abandonment operations. This segment designs, manufactures and markets its consumable engineered products to oilfield service as well as exploration and production companies. Product and service offerings for this segment include innovations in perforation technology through patented and proprietary systems combined with advanced modeling and analysis tools. This expertise has led to the optimization of perforation hole size, depth, and quality of tunnels, which are key factors for maximizing the effectiveness of hydraulic fracturing. Additional offerings include frac plug, toe valve and other elastomer products, which are focused on zonal isolation for hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells, and a broad range of consumable products, such as setting tools and bridge plugs, that are used in completion, intervention and decommissioning applications. Demand drivers for the Downhole Technologies segment include continued trends toward longer lateral lengths, increased frac stages and more perforation clusters to target increased unconventional well productivity.

 Demand for our completion-related products and services within our Completion and Production Services and Downhole Technologies segments is highly correlated to changes in the total number of wells drilled in the United States, total footage drilled, the number of drilled wells that are completed and changes in the drilling rig count. The following table sets forth a summary of the U.S. drilling rig count, as measured by Baker Hughes Company, as of and for the periods indicated. 
 As of October 25, 2024 
 Average for the Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 United States Rig Count: Land Oil 465 465 499 475 543 Land Natural gas and other 103 100 128 108 143 Offshore 17 21 22 21 21 585 586 649 604 707 
 The U.S. energy industry is primarily focused on crude oil and liquids-rich exploration and development activities in U.S. shale plays utilizing horizontal drilling and completion techniques. As of September 30, 2024, oil-directed drilling accounted for 82 of the total U.S. rig count with the balance largely natural gas related. 
 We use a variety of domestically produced and imported raw materials and component products, including steel, in the manufacture of our products. The United States has imposed tariffs on a variety of imported products, including steel and aluminum. In response to the U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum, the European Union and several other countries, including Canada and China, have threatened and/or imposed retaliatory tariffs. In addition, in response to Russia s invasion of Ukraine, governments in the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and other countries have enacted sanctions against Russia and Russian interests. The effect of these sanctions and tariffs and the application and interpretation of existing trade agreements and customs, anti-dumping and countervailing duty regulations continue to evolve, and we continue to monitor these matters. If we encounter difficulty in procuring these raw materials and component products, or if the prices we have to pay for these products increase and we are unable to pass corresponding cost increases on to our customers, our financial position, cash flows and results of operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore, uncertainty with respect to potential costs in the drilling and completion of oil and gas wells could cause our customers to delay or cancel planned projects which, if this occurred, would adversely affect our financial position, cash flows and results of operations. 
 Other factors that can affect our business and financial results include but are not limited to: the general global economic environment; competitive pricing pressures; customer consolidations; public health crises; natural disasters; labor market constraints; supply chain disruptions; inflation in wages, materials, parts, equipment and other costs; climate-related and other regulatory changes; geopolitical conflicts and tensions; management s implementation of strategic decisions; and changes in tax laws in the United States and international markets. We continue to monitor the global economy, the prices of and demand for crude oil and natural gas, and the resultant impact on the capital spending plans and operations of our customers in order to plan and manage our business.

 We reported a net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 14.3 million, or 0.23 per share. The reported third quarter net loss included charges of 18.2 million 17.0 million after tax, or 0.27 per share) associated with the restructuring of certain of its U.S. land-based operations, facility consolidations and closures, patent defense and personnel reductions. These results compare to net income for the three months ended September 30, 2023 of 4.2 million, or 0.07 per share, which included facility consolidation and other charges of 1.6 million 1.3 million after-tax, or 0.02 per share). 
 Our third quarter 2024 results of operations reflect the impact of operators continued investments in offshore and international project activity and associated backlog conversion, partially offset by a decline in land-based investments by our U.S. customers, competitive market conditions and management s decision to exit certain underperforming locations and service offerings in the United States. Management expects to continue to implement measures to reduce costs in areas experiencing lower activity levels. 
 Revenues. Consolidated total revenues in the third quarter of 2024 decreased 19.9 million, or 10 , from the third quarter of 2023. 
 Consolidated product revenues in the third quarter of 2024 decreased 1.8 million, or 2 , from the third quarter of 2023, driven primarily by lower U.S. short-cycle completion product sales volumes. Consolidated service revenues in the third quarter of 2024 decreased 18.1 million, or 20 , from the third quarter of 2023. This decrease was concentrated in the United States driven by lower land-based customer investments (particularly in natural gas basins), competitive market conditions and our exit of certain underperforming locations during the first half of 2024, partially offset by higher offshore and international service activity.

 Consolidated product costs in the third quarter of 2024 decreased 1.0 million, or 1 , from the third quarter of 2023 driven primarily by the decline in U.S. land-based products sales volumes. Consolidated service costs in the third quarter of 2024 decreased 12.8 million, or 18 , from the third quarter of 2023, with the impact of lower U.S. land-based activity levels and implemented cost control measures partially offset by facility exit and severance costs incurred in third quarter of 2024. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expense. Selling, general and administrative expense was 22.8 million in the third quarter of 2024, which included 1.3 million of costs associated with enforcing certain of our patents.

 Impairments of Intangible Assets. In the third quarter of 2024, as a result of our decision to exit an underperforming service offering, our Completion and Production Services segment recognized non-cash impairment charges of 10.8 million to reduce the carrying amount of its long-lived intangible assets to estimated fair value. See Note 2, Asset Impairments and Other Charges and Credits, to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional discussion. 
 Impairments of Operating Lease Assets. In the third quarter of 2024, management made strategic decisions to exit five leased service locations within our Completion and Production Services segment and one within our Downhole Technologies segment. As a result of these decisions, our Completion and Production Services and Downhole Technologies segments recognized non-cash impairment charges totaling 2.6 million to reduce the carrying amount of the related operating lease assets. See Note 2, Asset Impairments and Other Charges and Credits, to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional discussion. 
 Operating Income. Our consolidated operating loss was 11.0 million in the third quarter of 2024, which included 13.4 million in non-cash intangible and operating lease asset impairment charges and charges totaling 4.8 million associated with facility consolidations and exits, patent defense and other management actions. This compares to third quarter 2023 consolidated operating income of 6.2 million, which included facility consolidation and other charges of 1.6 million. Excluding these charges, operating results declined 0.7 million year-over-year, driven by the substantial decline in activity levels in the United States. 
 Interest Expense, Net. Net interest expense totaled 1.8 million in the third quarter of 2024, which compares to 1.9 million in the same period of 2023. Interest expense as a percentage of total debt outstanding was approximately 7 in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 7 in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Income Tax. Income tax provision for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was calculated using a discrete approach. This methodology was used because changes in our results of operations and non-deductible expenses can materially impact the estimated annual effective tax rate. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our income tax provision was 2.2 million on a pre-tax loss of 12.1 million, which included unfavorable changes in valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets and certain non-deductible expenses. This compares to an income tax provision of 0.2 million on a pre-tax income of 4.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which included certain non-deductible expenses, discrete tax items and a reduction in valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets. 
 Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). Reported comprehensive loss is the sum of reported net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income was 9.6 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to comprehensive loss of 5.7 million in the third quarter of 2023 due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates compared to the U.S. dollar which are used to translate certain of the international operations of our operating segments. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, currency translation adjustments recognized as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) were primarily attributable to the United Kingdom and Brazil. During the third quarter of 2024, the exchange rate for the British pound and the Brazilian real strengthened compared to the U.S. dollar. In the third quarter of 2023, the exchange rates for the British pound and the Brazilian real weakened compared to the U.S. dollar.

 Completion and Production Services 
 Revenues. Our Completion and Production Services segment revenues decreased 19.7 million, or 33 , in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior-year period, driven primarily by lower U.S. land-based customer activity levels (particularly in natural gas basins), competitive market conditions and our exit of certain underperforming service locations during the first half of 2024. 
 Operating Income (Loss). Our Completion and Production Services segment reported an operating loss of 18.3 million in the third quarter of 2024, which included charges totaling 17.2 million associated with the exit of a service offering, facility consolidations and exits, the defense of patents and other management actions. This compares to operating income of 3.3 million in the third quarter of 2023. Excluding the 2024 charges discussed above, the Completion and Production Services segment s operating income declined 4.3 million from the prior-year period, with the impact of the decrease in U.S. land-based revenues partially offset by implemented cost control measures. 
 The segment s U.S. land-based service offerings and facilities exited during the third quarter of 2024 collectively generated revenues of 9.3 million and operating losses of 17.1 million in the current quarter, which included intangible and operating lease asset impairment, facility closure and other charges totaling 15.1 million as well as depreciation and amortization expense of 1.3 million. 
 Downhole Technologies 
 Revenues. Our Downhole Technologies segment revenues decreased 6.4 million, or 17 , in the third quarter of 2024 from the prior-year period, driven primarily by lower U.S. customer activity levels and competitive market conditions.

 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 We reported a net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 26.4 million, or 0.42 per share. The reported first nine months net loss included net charges and credits of 34.6 million 31.6 million after tax, or 0.51 per share) associated with the restructuring of certain of its U.S. land-based operations, facility consolidations and closures, patent defense, personnel reductions and debt extinguishment. These results compare to net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 6.9 million, or 0.11 per share, which included facility consolidation and other charges of 1.6 million 1.3 million after-tax, or 0.02 per share). 
 Our results of operations for the first nine months of 2024 reflect the impact of operators continued investment in offshore and international project activity and associated backlog conversion, partially offset by a decline in land-based investments by our U.S. customers, competitive market conditions and management s decision to exit certain underperforming locations and service offerings in the United States. Management expects to continue to implement measures to reduce costs in areas experiencing lower activity levels. 
 Revenues. Consolidated total revenues in the first nine months of 2024 decreased 46.0 million, or 8 , from the first nine months of 2023. 
 Consolidated product revenues in the first nine months of 2024 increased 8.6 million, or 3 , from the first nine months of 2023, with the impact of higher customer demand for project-driven production facility products and military products partially offset by a decline in U.S. customer demand for completion and perforating products. Consolidated service revenues in the first nine months of 2024 decreased 54.6 million, or 20 , from the first nine months of 2023. This decrease was concentrated in the United States driven by lower land-based customer investments (particularly in natural gas basins), competitive market conditions and our exit of certain underperforming locations during the first half of 2024, partially offset by higher offshore and international service activity.

During the first quarter of 2024, our Downhole Technologies operations recognized a non-cash impairment charge of 10.0 million related to goodwill transferred to the business in connection with segment realignment discussed above. See Note 2, Asset Impairments and Other Charges and Credits, to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional discussion. 
 Impairments of Intangible Assets. In the first nine months of 2024, as a result of our decision to exit an underperforming service offering, our Completion and Production Services business recognized non-cash impairment charges of 10.8 million to reduce the carrying amount of its long-lived intangible assets to estimated fair value. See Note 2, Asset Impairments and Other Charges and Credits, to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional discussion. 
 Impairments of Operating Lease Assets. In the first nine months of 2024, management made strategic decisions to exit five leased service locations within our Completion and Production Services segment and one within our Downhole Technologies segment. As a result of these decisions, our Completion and Production Services and Downhole Technologies segments recognized non-cash impairment charges totaling 2.6 million to reduce the carrying amount of the related operating lease assets. See Note 2, Asset Impairments and Other Charges and Credits, to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional discussion. 
 Operating Income (Loss). Our consolidated operating loss was 20.2 million in the first nine months of 2024, which included 23.4 million in non-cash goodwill, intangible and operating lease asset impairment charges and other charges totaling 11.8 million associated with facility consolidations and exits, patent defense and other management actions. This compares to consolidated operating income of 15.3 million in the first nine months of 2023, which included facility consolidation and other charges of 1.6 million. Excluding these charges, operating results declined 2.0 million year-over-year, driven by the substantial decline in activity levels in the United States. 
 Interest Expense, Net. Net interest expense totaled 6.0 million in the first nine months of 2024, which compares to 6.4 million in the first nine months of 2023. Interest expense as a percentage of total debt outstanding was approximately 7 in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 7 in the first nine months of 2023.

This compares to an income tax provision of 2.7 million on pre-tax income of 9.6 million for the first nine months of 2023, which included certain non-deductible expenses, discrete tax items and a reduction in valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets. 
 Other Comprehensive Income. Reported comprehensive income (loss) is the sum of reported net income (loss) and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income was 3.4 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to comprehensive income of 1.7 million in the first nine months of 2023 due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the U.S. dollar for certain of the international operations of our operating segments. For the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, currency translation adjustments recognized as a component of other comprehensive income were primarily attributable to the United Kingdom and Brazil. During the first nine months of 2024, the exchange rates for the British pound strengthened compared to the U.S. dollar while the Brazilian real weakened compared to the U.S. dollar. This compares to the first nine months of 2023, when the exchange rates for the British pound and the Brazilian real strengthened compared to the U.S. dollar.

 Completion and Production Services 
 Revenues. Our Completion and Production Services segment revenues decreased 57.6 million, or 30 , in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023, driven primarily by lower U.S. customer activity levels (particularly in natural gas basins), competitive market conditions and our exit of certain underperforming service locations during the first half of 2024. 
 Operating Income (Loss). Our Completion and Production Services segment reported an operating loss of 19.2 million in the first nine months of 2024, which included charges totaling 21.1 million associated with the exit of a service offering, facility consolidations and exits, the defense of patents and other management actions. This compares to operating income of 15.0 million in the first nine months of 2023. Excluding the 2024 charges discussed above, the Completion and Production Services segment s operating income declined 13.1 million from the prior-year period, with the impact of a decrease in U.S. land-based revenues partially offset by implemented cost control measures. 
 The segment s U.S. land-based service offerings and facilities exited during the first nine months of 2024 collectively generated revenues of 35.8 million and operating losses of 24.0 million in 2024, which included intangible and operating lease asset impairment, facility closure and other charges totaling 17.4 million as well as depreciation and amortization expense of 4.2 million. 
 Downhole Technologies

 Liquidity, Capital Resources and Other Matters 
 Our primary liquidity needs are to fund operating and capital expenditures, new product development and general working capital needs. In addition, capital has been used to fund strategic business acquisitions, repay debt and fund share repurchases. Our primary sources of funds are cash flow from operations, proceeds from borrowings under our credit facilities and, less frequently, capital markets transactions. 
 Operating Activities 
 Cash flows from operations totaled 27.7 million during the first nine months of 2024, compared to 52.4 million generated by operations during the first nine months of 2023. 
 During the first nine months of 2024, 13.2 million was used to fund net working capital increases, primarily due to an activity-driven increase in inventories, the payment of accrued 2023 short- and long-term cash incentives in the first quarter of 2024 and a decrease in accounts payable, partially offset by the favorable impact of a decrease in accounts receivable. During the first nine months of 2023, 3.2 million was used to fund net working capital increases, with an activity-driven increase in inventories and the payment of accrued 2022 short-and long-term cash incentives in the first quarter of 2023 substantially offset by the favorable impact of a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in deferred revenues. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities during the first nine months of 2024 totaled 8.3 million, compared to 19.1 million used in investing activities during the first nine months of 2023. 
 Capital expenditures totaled 23.3 million and 23.4 million during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. These investments were offset by proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of 15.4 million and 4.4 million during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Within our Offshore Manufactured Products segment, we completed the consolidation of certain facilities in Houston, Texas during 2023 and have strategically relocated our Asian manufacturing and service operations from Singapore to Batam, Indonesia. With these consolidations, a facility classified as held for sale within prepaid expenses and other current assets as of December 31, 2023 was sold during the second quarter of 2024 for net proceeds of 10.3 million. 
 Including investments associated with the construction of a new facility in Batam, we expect to invest approximately 30 million in capital expenditures during 2024. We plan to fund our capital expenditures with available cash, internally generated funds and, if necessary, borrowings under our ABL Facility discussed below. 
 Financing Activities 
 During the first nine months of 2024, net cash of 20.2 million was used in financing activities, which included the purchase of 11.5 million principal amount of our outstanding 2026 Notes for 10.8 million in cash and the repurchase of 5.1 million of the Company s common stock. This compares to 22.7 million of cash used in financing activities during the first nine months of 2023, which included the repayment of the 17.3 million principal amount outstanding under our 2023 Notes and the repurchase of 3.0 million of our common stock. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 46.0 million, which compared to 47.1 million as of December 31, 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had no borrowings outstanding under our ABL Facility, 123.5 million principal amount of our 2026 Notes (as defined below) outstanding and other debt of 3.0 million. Our reported interest expense included amortization of deferred financing costs of 1.2 million during the first nine months of 2024. For the first nine months of 2024, our contractual cash interest expense was 5.5 million, or approximately 6 of the average principal balance of debt outstanding. 
 We believe that cash on-hand, cash flow from operations and borrowing capacity available under our ABL Facility will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs in the coming twelve months. If our plans or assumptions change, or are inaccurate, we may need to raise additional capital. Our ability to obtain capital for additional projects to implement our growth strategy over the longer term will depend upon our future operating performance, financial condition and, more broadly, on the availability of equity and debt financing. Capital availability will be affected by prevailing conditions in our industry, the global economy, the global banking and financial markets, stakeholder scrutiny of ESG matters and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. For companies like ours that support the energy industry, disruptions affecting the availability of capital have in the

 past and may in the future negatively impact the value of our common stock and may reduce our ability to access capital in the bank and capital markets or result in such capital being available on less favorable terms, which could negatively affect our liquidity. 
 On March 6, 2024, the SEC finalized rules relating to the disclosure of a range of climate-related information (the Rules ). The Rules were temporarily stayed by the SEC on April 4, 2024 pending judicial review. While subject to ongoing litigation, these new disclosure requirements are currently effective for us beginning with the year ending December 31, 2026, phased in over a five-year period. The ultimate impact on our business is uncertain but we and our customers may incur increased compliance costs related to the assessment and disclosure of climate-related risks. We may also face increased litigation risks related to disclosures made pursuant to the rule if finalized as proposed. In addition, enhanced climate disclosure requirements could accelerate the trend of certain stakeholders and lenders in restricting access to capital or seeking more stringent conditions with respect to their investments in us, our customers and other companies like ours that support the energy industry. For more information on our risks related to climate change, see the risk factors in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K titled, Our and our customers operations are subject to a series of risks arising out of the threat of climate change that could result in increased operating costs, limit the areas in which oil and natural gas production may occur, and reduce demand for the products and services we provide, The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 could accelerate the transition to a low carbon economy and could impose new costs on our customers operations and Increasing attention to ESG matters may impact our business. 
 Stock Repurchase Program. On February 16, 2023, our Board of Directors authorized 25.0 million for repurchases of our common stock, par value 0.01 per share, through February 2025. Subject to applicable securities laws, such purchases will be at such times and in such amounts as we deem appropriate. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 5.5 million in repurchases of common stock were made under the program. The amount remaining under our share repurchase authorization as of September 30, 2024 was 12.6 million. On October 24, 2024, our Board of Directors terminated our existing common stock repurchase program and replaced it with a new 50.0 million common stock repurchase authorization, which expires in October 2026. 
 Revolving Credit Facility. Our senior secured credit facility provides for a 125.0 million asset-based revolving credit facility (as amended, the ABL Facility under which credit availability is subject to a borrowing base calculation. On February 16, 2024, we amended the ABL Facility to extend the maturity date to February 16, 2028. 
 The ABL Facility is governed by a credit agreement, as amended, with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent and the lenders and other financial institutions from time to time party thereto (as amended, the ABL Agreement ). The ABL Agreement matures on February 16, 2028 with a springing maturity 91 days prior to the maturity of any outstanding indebtedness with a principal amount in excess of 17.5 million. See Note 4, Long-term Debt, to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information regarding the ABL Agreement. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 15.1 million of outstanding letters of credit, but no borrowings outstanding under the ABL Agreement. The total amount available to be drawn as of September 30, 2024 was 76.4 million, calculated based on the then-current borrowing base less outstanding letters of credit. 
 2026 Notes. We issued 135.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.75 convertible senior notes due 2026 (the 2026 Notes pursuant to an indenture, dated as of March 19, 2021 (the 2026 Indenture ), between us and Computershare Trust Company, National Association, as successor trustee. As of September 30, 2024, we have purchased a cumulative 11.5 million principal amount of the 2026 Notes for 10.8 million in cash, with 123.5 million principal amount outstanding. The outstanding 2026 Notes will mature on April 1, 2026, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. 
 The 2026 Indenture contains certain events of default, including certain defaults by us with respect to other indebtedness of at least 40.0 million. See Note 4, Long-term Debt, to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information regarding the 2026 Notes. As of September 30, 2024, none of the conditions allowing holders of the 2026 Notes to convert, or requiring us to repurchase the 2026 Notes, had been met. 
 2023 Notes. On February 15, 2023, our 2023 Notes matured and the outstanding 17.3 million in principal amount was repaid in full. 
 Our total debt represented 15 and 16 of our combined total debt and stockholders equity as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 Contingencies and Other Obligations. We are a party to various pending or threatened claims, lawsuits and administrative proceedings seeking damages or other remedies concerning our commercial operations, products, employees and other matters. 
 See Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies, to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional discussion. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. As of September 30, 2024, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 For a discussion of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we use in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements, see Part II Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. These estimates require significant judgments, assumptions and estimates. We have discussed the development, selection, and disclosure of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our Board of Directors. There have been no material changes to the judgments, assumptions and estimates upon which our critical accounting estimates are based. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Management believes that the impact of recently issued standards, which are not yet effective, will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption. 
 
 ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Market risk refers to the potential losses arising from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices, including the correlation among these factors and their volatility. 
 Our principal market risks are our exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into derivative instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet risk management objectives and do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes. 
 Interest Rate Risk. We have a revolving credit facility that is subject to the risk of higher interest charges associated with increases in interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, we had no floating-rate obligations outstanding under our ABL Facility. The use of floating-rate obligations would expose us to the risk of increased interest expense in the event of increases in short-term interest rates. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk. Our operations are conducted in various countries around the world and we receive revenue from these operations in a number of different currencies. As such, our earnings are subject to movements in foreign currency exchange rates when transactions are denominated in (i) currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which is our functional currency, or (ii) the functional currency of our subsidiaries, which is not necessarily the U.S. dollar. In order to mitigate the effects of foreign currency exchange rate risks in areas outside of the United States (primarily in our Offshore Manufactured Products segment), we generally pay a portion of our expenses in local currencies and a substantial portion of our contracts provide for collections from customers in U.S. dollars. During the first nine months of 2024, our reported foreign currency exchange losses were 0.4 million and are included in other operating (income) expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations. 
 Accumulated other comprehensive loss, reported as a component of stockholders equity, primarily relates to fluctuations in currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar as used to translate certain of the international operations of our operating segments. Our accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased 3.4 million from 70.0 million as of December 31, 2023 to 66.6 million as of September 30, 2024, due to changes in currency exchange rates. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the exchange rates for the British pound strengthened by 5 compared to the U.S. dollar while the Brazilian real weakened by 11 compared to the U.S. dollar.

 ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures 
 (i) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) of the Exchange Act. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 at the reasonable assurance level. 
 (ii) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
