Under the Company s Stock Incentive Plan, up to million shares of the Company s Class A common stock may be issued to satisfy vested restricted stock units granted to directors, officers, employees, contractors and consultants of the Company. The purpose of the Stock Incentive Plan is to promote the Company s long - term financial success by attracting, retaining and rewarding eligible participants. As a result of the Company s organizational structure, a description of which can be found in Business Our Organizational Structure in Part I, Item 1 of the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 27, 2024, there is no material dilutive effect upon ownership of common stockholders of issuing shares under the Stock Incentive Plan. The issuances do not dilute the book value of the ownership of common stockholders since the restricted stock units are granted at market value, and upon their vesting and the related issuance of shares of common stock, the ownership of IBG, Inc. in IBG LLC, increases proportionately to the shares issued. As a result of such proportionate increase in share ownership, the dilution upon issuance of common stock is borne by IBG LLC s majority member (i.e., noncontrolling interest), Holdings, and not by IBG, Inc. or its common stockholders. Additionally, dilution of earnings that may take place after issuance of common stock is reflected in EPS reported in the Company s financial statements. The EPS dilution can be neither estimated nor projected, but historically it has not been material. The Stock Incentive Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Company s Board of Directors. The Compensation Committee has discretionary authority to determine the eligibility to participate in the Stock Incentive Plan and establishes the terms and conditions of the awards, including the number of awards granted to each participant and all other terms and conditions applicable to such awards in individual grant agreements. Awards are expected to be made primarily through grants of restricted stock units. Stock Incentive Plan awards are subject to issuance over time. All previously granted but not yet earned awards may be canceled by the Company upon the participant s termination of employment or violation of certain applicable covenants before issuance, unless determined otherwise by the Compensation Committee.

On August 5, 2024, the Federal Circuit denied the petition and issued the mandate of the court on August 12, 2024. Thereafter, Harris Brumfield sought an extension of time to file a petition for a writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court of the United States and, on October 3, 2024, the Court granted Harris Brumfield a portion of the extension sought, extending the time to file until January 2, 2025. Class Action Matter On December 18, 2015, a former individual customer filed a purported class action complaint against IB LLC, IBG, Inc., and Thomas Frank, Ph.D., the Company s Executive Vice President and Chief Information Officer, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut. The complaint alleges that a purported class of IB LLC s customers were harmed by alleged flaws in the computerized system used to close out (i.e., liquidate) positions in customer brokerage accounts that have margin deficiencies. The complaint seeks, among other things, undefined compensatory damages and declaratory and injunctive relief. On September 28, 2016, the District Court issued an order granting the Company s motion to dismiss the complaint in its entirety, without leave to amend. On September 28, 2017, the plaintiff appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. On September 26, 2018, the Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal of plaintiff s claims of breach of contract and commercially unreasonable liquidation but vacated and remanded back to the District Court plaintiff s claims for negligence.

million to general and administrative expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Regulatory Matters IB LLC has identified a number of issues dating back to 2016 related to the Company s compliance with sanctions regulations, predominantly concerning the facilitation of transactions in countries, or by entities, sanctioned by the Office of Foreign Assets Control OFAC of the United States Department of the Treasury. The Company has made voluntary self-disclosures to OFAC, has received additional inquiries from OFAC related to the Company s sanctions compliance program, and is cooperating with the investigation. The Company cannot currently predict when OFAC s investigation will conclude or the exact amount of any potential civil money penalty. The Company believes that, in addition to its voluntary self-disclosures and continued cooperation with OFAC, the significant investment in and improvements to the Company s Anti-Money Laundering and Sanctions programs over the past five years will be considered as mitigating factors with respect to the matter, and that any monetary fines or restrictions will not be material to the Company s financial results. Guarantees Certain of the operating subsidiaries provide guarantees to securities and commodities clearing houses and exchanges which meet the accounting definition of a guarantee under FASB ASC Topic 460, Guarantees. Under standard membership agreements, clearing house and exchange members are required to guarantee collectively the performance of other members. Under the agreements, if a member becomes unable to satisfy its obligations, other members would be required to meet shortfalls. In the opinion of management, the operating subsidiaries liability under these arrangements is not quantifiable and could exceed the cash and securities they have posted as collateral. However, the potential for these operating subsidiaries to be required to make payments under these arrangements is remote. Accordingly, contingent liability is carried in the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition for these arrangements. In connection with its retail brokerage business, IB LLC or other electronic brokerage operating subsidiaries perform securities and commodities execution, clearance and settlement on behalf of their customers for whom they commit to settle trades submitted by such customers with the respective clearing houses. If a customer fails to fulfill its settlement obligations, the respective operating subsidiary must fulfill those settlement obligations. contingent liability is carried on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition for such customer obligations. Other Commitments Certain clearing houses, clearing banks and firms used by certain operating subsidiaries are given a security interest in certain assets of those operating subsidiaries held by those clearing organizations. These assets may be applied to satisfy the obligations of those operating subsidiaries to the respective clearing organizations.

Business Environment During the quarter ended September 30, 2024 current quarter ), world equities markets generally rose compared to the prior quarter, with only Japan registering a decline in its index among the major markets. Within U.S. equities, which led the world with a 34 year-over-year gain in the S P 500 index, the dominance of a small number of technology stocks (the so-called Magnificent 7 weakened, with these stocks responsible for about 12 of the S P 500 index s gains during the current quarter, down from 37 in the prior-year quarter and 95 in the second quarter of 2024. Inflationary pressures have eased gradually and, as a result, central banks in several countries cut their policy rates after several quarters of market speculation about central bank policies. However, the U.S. elections and geopolitical uncertainties remain prominent sources of volatility.

 Table of Contents 

The following is a summary of the key economic drivers that affect our business and how they compared to the prior-year quarter: Global trading volumes. Worldwide, equities volumes reported by most major exchanges increased in the current quarter versus the prior-year quarter. In the U.S., according to industry data, average daily volume in exchange-listed equity-based options increased by 12 , futures by 27 and listed cash equities by 10 , compared to the prior-year quarter. Options trading volumes continue to rise with the growing popularity of shorter-dated options contracts. In futures, market volumes increased across all product segments, particularly in interest rate products, with notable percentage increases in commodities such as metals and energy. These factors led to strong results across our major product types. Our customer options, equities, futures and foreign exchange volumes were up 35 , 22 , 13 and 8 , respectively. Note that while U.S. options, futures, cash equities and foreign exchange volumes are readily comparable measures, they reflect most but not all of the global volumes that generate our commission revenue. See Trading Volumes and Customer Statistics below in this Item 2 for additional details regarding our executed order volumes, contract and share volumes, and customer statistics. Volatility. U.S. market volatility, as measured by the average Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index VIX ), increased 13 , from an average of 15.1 in the prior-year quarter to 17.1 in the current quarter, primarily due to a temporary spike in August that has since moderated. Volatility levels remain below the levels reached in 2020 through 2022 as world economic outlook has improved and recession fears have lessened. In general, higher volatility typically enhances our performance because it often correlates positively with customer trading activity across product types. Interest Rates. The U.S. Federal Reserve cut the benchmark federal funds rate in September 2024, reducing it by 50 basis points after holding it steady since July 2023. Once again, the U.S. Treasury yield curve remained inverted, with long-term rates lower than short-term. Other central banks, including those in Europe, Canada, Hong Kong, the United Kingdom and Switzerland, also lowered rates this quarter, with Europe cutting for the second time, and Canada and Switzerland for the third time, this year. In other countries with developed financial markets, such as Australia and Japan, benchmark interest rates either held steady or increased. Lower U.S. benchmark rates reduce the interest we earn on our segregated cash, the majority of which is invested in short-term U.S. government securities and related instruments. Higher short-term rates and an inverted yield curve have led us to maintain a short duration portfolio, nearly all of which matured within three months at September 30, 2024, to more closely match our asset and liability maturities on our interest-sensitive assets. Further, our margin balances are tied to benchmark rates, so lower rates limit the interest we earn on margin lending to our customers. We continue to offer among the lowest rates in the industry on margin lending, and we believe our low rates are an important feature that attracts customers to our platform. As an offset, lower rates also reduce our interest expense. For example, in U.S. dollars we pay interest to customers on their qualified cash balances when the federal funds effective rate is above 0.50 , which it has been since May 2022. With benchmark rates at higher levels than in the extended period during and after the pandemic, rate compression is eliminated and we are able to earn our full 0.50 spread. We believe the attractive rates we pay on customer cash are among the highest in the industry and are another important feature that draws customers to our platform. Net interest income on customer margin loan balances increased compared to the prior-year quarter despite the average federal funds effective rate remaining stable at 5.26 , as margin loan balances grew in a risk-on environment. Higher average balances contributed to a 9 rise in net interest income from the prior-year quarter, though our overall net interest margin declined from 2.46 in the prior-year quarter to 2.37 in the current quarter, primarily due to slightly lower yields on our margin loan balances and segregated cash and securities. Currency fluctuations. As a global electronic broker trading on exchanges around the world in multiple currencies, we are exposed to foreign currency risk. We actively manage this exposure by keeping our equity in proportion to a defined basket of 10 currencies we call the GLOBAL to diversify our risk and to align our hedging strategy with the currencies that we use in our business. Because we report our financial results in U.S. dollars, the change in the value of the GLOBAL versus the U.S. dollar affects our earnings. During the current quarter, the value of the GLOBAL, as measured in U.S. dollars, increased 1.14 compared to its value at June 30, 2024, which had a positive impact on our comprehensive earnings for the current quarter. A discussion of our approach for managing foreign currency exposure is contained in Part I, Item 3 of this Quarterly Report Form 10-Q entitled Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

Financial Overview We report non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude certain items that may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook and are useful in evaluating the operating performance of our business. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section below in this Item 2 for additional details. Diluted earnings per share were 1.67 for the current quarter, compared to diluted earnings per share of 1.56 for the prior-year quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were 1.61 for the current quarter and 1.55 for the prior-year quarter. The calculation of diluted earnings per share is detailed in Note 4 Equity and Earnings per Share to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Part 1, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. For the current quarter, our net revenues were 1,365 million and income before income taxes was 909 million, compared to net revenues of 1,145 million and income before income taxes of 840 million in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted net revenues were 1,327 million and adjusted income before income taxes was 871 million, compared to adjusted net revenues of 1,139 million and adjusted income before income taxes of 834 million in the prior-year quarter. Financial highlights for the current quarter (compared to the prior-year quarter): Commission revenue increased 31 to 435 million on higher customer trading volumes. Customer trading volume in options, stocks and futures increased 35 , 22 and 13 , respectively. Net interest income increased 9 to 802 million on higher customer margin loans and customer credit balances. Other fees and services increased 20 million, or 38 , to 72 million, driven by increases of 13 million in risk exposure fees, 5 million in payments for order flow from exchange-mandated programs, and 2 million in FDIC sweep program fees. Execution, clearing and distribution fees expenses increased 18 to 116 million, driven by a higher SEC fee rate and higher customer trading volumes. General and administrative expenses increased 108 million to 153 million, driven primarily by 87 million related to legal and regulatory matters and a one-time charge of 12 million related to the consolidation of our European subsidiaries. Pretax profit margin was 67 for the current quarter compared to 73 in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted pretax profit margin for the current quarter was 66 compared to 73 in the prior-year quarter. Total equity as of September 30, 2024 was 16.0 billion. In connection with our currency diversification strategy, as of September 30, 2024, approximately 25 of our equity was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In the current quarter, our currency diversification strategy increased our comprehensive earnings by 178 million (compared to a decrease of 93 million in the prior-year quarter), as the U.S. dollar value of the GLOBAL increased by approximately 1.14 , compared to its value as of June 30, 2024. The effects of our currency diversification strategy are reported as (1) a component of Other income (gain of 25 million) in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income and (2) other comprehensive income OCI (gain of 153 million) in the consolidated statements of financial condition and the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The full effect of the GLOBAL is captured in comprehensive income.

Certain Trends and Uncertainties We believe that our current operations may be favorably or unfavorably impacted by the following trends and uncertainties that may affect our financial condition and results of operations: Retail participation in the equity markets has fluctuated in the past due to investor sentiment, market conditions and a variety of other factors. Retail transaction volumes may not be sustainable and are not predictable. Consolidation among market centers may adversely affect the value of our IB SmartRouting SM software. Price competition among broker-dealers may continue to intensify. Benchmark interest rates tend to fluctuate with economic conditions. Changes in interest rates may not be predictable. Fiscal and/or monetary policy may change and impact the financial services business and securities markets. New legislation or modifications to existing regulations and rules could occur in the future. Scrutiny of such topics as the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and information security by regulatory and legislative authorities has increased. The impact of another pandemic or other public health emergency will depend on numerous evolving factors that cannot be accurately predicted, including the duration and spread of the pandemic, governmental regulations in response to the pandemic, and the effectiveness of vaccinations and other medical advancements. We continue to be exposed to the risks and uncertainties of doing business in international markets, particularly in the heavily regulated brokerage industry. Such risks and uncertainties include political, economic and financial instability, and foreign policy changes. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have escalated in recent years, and changes in Chinese governmental oversight of Hong Kong and in the Chinese and Hong Kong capital markets could result in adverse effects on our business and loss of assets we hold in the region. Additionally, although our direct and indirect exposures to Russia and Ukraine are not material, the war in Ukraine and related sanctions have created substantial uncertainty in the global economy and financial markets. We continue to monitor the war and assess any potential impact to our business, including effects relating to currency control restrictions imposed by the Central Bank of Russia and other governments, and restrictions by the Moscow Stock Exchange MOEX regarding the sale of assets by non-Russian residents, as well as sanctions imposed by the U.S., the U.K., the European Union and other countries against the MOEX, the Russian clearinghouse (National Clearing Centre, or NCC) and Russian Depository (Non-Bank Credit Institution Joint Stock Company National Settlement Depository, or NSD). Our remaining market making activities will continue to be impacted by market structure changes, market conditions, the level of automation of competitors, and the relationship between actual and implied volatility in the equities markets. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10 - K, filed with the SEC on February 27, 2024, and elsewhere in this report for a discussion of other risks that may affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 current quarter compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 prior-year quarter Net Revenues Total net revenues, for the current quarter, increased 220 million, or 19 , compared to the prior-year quarter, to 1,365 million. The increase in net revenues was due to higher commissions, net interest income, other income, and other fees and services. Commissions We earn commissions from our cleared customers for whom we act as an executing and clearing broker and from our non - cleared customers for whom we act as an execution - only broker. Our commission structure allows customers to choose between (1) an all - inclusive fixed, or bundled , rate; (2) a tiered, or unbundled , rate that offers lower commissions for high volume customers where we pass through regulatory and exchange fees; and (3) our IBKR Lite SM offering, which provides commission-free trades on U.S. exchange-listed stocks and ETFs. IBKR Lite SM trades generate payments from market makers and others to whom we route these orders, which are reported in commissions . Our commissions are geographically diversified. Commissions, for the current quarter, increased 102 million, or 31 , compared to the prior-year quarter, to 435 million, driven by higher customer volume in options, stocks and futures. Total customer options and futures contract and stock share volumes increased 35 , 13 and 22 , respectively. Total DARTs for the current quarter increased 42 to 2.7 million, compared to 1.9 million for the prior-year quarter. Average commission per commissionable order for cleared customers, for the current quarter, decreased 9 to 2.83, compared to 3.11 for the prior-year quarter, due to smaller average order sizes across all product classes and lower average commissions per contract in options. Other Fees and Services We earn fee income on services provided to customers, which includes market data fees, risk exposure fees, payments for order flow from exchange-mandated programs, FDIC sweep fees, and other fees and services charged to customers. Other fees and services, for the current quarter, increased 20 million, or 38 , compared to the prior-year quarter, to 72 million, driven by a 13 million increase in risk exposure fees as customers exhibited more risk-on behavior, a 5 million increase in payments for order flow from exchange-mandated programs driven by higher customer trading volumes, and a 2 million increase in FDIC sweep fees due to higher customer balances. Other Income Other income consists of foreign exchange gains (losses) from our currency diversification strategy, gains (losses) from principal transactions, gains (losses) from our equity method and other investments, and other revenue not directly attributable to our core business offerings. A discussion of our approach to managing foreign currency exposure is contained in Part I, Item 3 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q entitled Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Other income, for the current quarter, increased 29 million, or 107 , compared to the prior-year quarter, to 56 million. This increase was mainly comprised of 42 million related our currency diversification strategy, which gained 25 million in the current quarter compared to a loss of 17 million in the prior-year quarter; partially offset by 12 million related to our strategic investment in Tiger Brokers, which gained 11 million in the current quarter compared to a gain of 23 million in the prior year quarter. Interest Income and Interest Expense We earn interest on margin lending to customers that is secured by marketable securities and currency balances these customers hold with us; from our investments in U.S. and foreign government securities; from borrowing and lending securities; on deposits (in positive interest rate currencies) with banks; and on certain customers cash balances in negative rate currencies. We pay interest on customer cash balances (in sufficiently positive interest rate currencies); for borrowing and lending securities; on deposits (in negative interest rate currencies) with banks; and on our borrowings. Net interest income (interest income less interest expense), for the current quarter, increased 69 million, or 9 , compared to the prior-year quarter, to 802 million. The increase in net interest income was driven by higher customer margin loans and customer credit balances.

 Table of Contents 

Net interest income on customer balances, for the current quarter, increased 95 million, compared to the prior-year quarter, driven by an 11.8 billion increase in average customer margin loans and an 11.4 billion increase in average customer credit balances. See the Business Environment section above in this Item 2 for a further discussion about the change in interest rates in the current quarter. The Company measures return on interest-earning assets using net interest margin NIM ). NIM is computed by dividing the annualized net interest income by the average interest-earning assets for the period. Interest-earning assets consist of cash and securities segregated for regulatory purposes (including U.S. government securities and securities purchased under agreements to resell) , customer margin loans, securities borrowed, other interest-earning assets (solely firm assets) and customer cash balances swept into FDIC-insured banks as part of our Insured Bank Deposit Sweep Program. Interest-bearing liabilities consist of customer credit balances, securities loaned, and other interest-bearing liabilities. Yields are generally a reflection of benchmark interest rates in each currency in which the Company and its customers hold cash balances. Because a meaningful portion of customer cash and margin loans are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, changes in U.S. benchmark interest rates do not impact the total amount of segregated cash and securities, customer margin loans and customer credit balances. Furthermore, because interest, when benchmark rates are at sufficiently high levels, is paid only on eligible cash credit balances (i.e., balances over 10 thousand or equivalent, in securities accounts with over 100 thousand in equity, and in smaller accounts at reduced rates), changes in benchmark interest rates are not passed through to the total amount of customer credit balances. Finally, the Company s policies with respect to currencies with near zero or negative interest rates impact the overall yields on segregated cash and customer credit balances as effective interest rates in those currencies move above or below zero. We earn income on securities loaned and borrowed to support customer long and short stock holdings in margin accounts. A securities lending transaction generates (1) net interest earned on lending a security, which is based on supply and demand for that security, and (2) interest earned on the cash collateral deposited for the loan of that security, which is based on benchmark interest rates. Interest on this collateral is reported as net interest on segregated cash, since cash collateral from securities lending is held in specially-designated bank accounts for the benefit of customers, in accordance with U.S. customer protection rules. Generally, as benchmark interest rates rise, while the overall revenue generated from a securities lending transaction may not change, the portion derived from interest earned on the cash collateral, which is classified as net interest income on Segregated cash and securities, net increases, while the portion classified as Securities borrowed and loaned, net decreases. In the current quarter, average securities borrowed balances increased 12 , to 6.2 billion, and average securities loaned balances increased 45 , to 14.3 billion, compared to the prior-year quarter. Net interest earned from securities lending is affected by the level of demand for securities positions held by our customers that investors are looking to sell short. During the current quarter, net interest earned from securities lending transactions decreased 50 million, or 76 , compared to the prior-year quarter, driven by lower demand for selling stocks short, as the stock market rose steadily in the current quarter, and by fewer so-called hard to borrow stocks industry wide. As noted above, the rise in benchmark interest rates has shifted a portion of the interest reported as generated by lending securities to interest income on segregated cash (see further explanation above). It should be noted that securities lending transactions entered into to support customer activity may produce interest income (expense) that is offset by interest expense (income) related to customer balances. We estimate that if the interest earned and paid on cash collateral related to our securities lending transactions were included under Securities borrowed and loaned, net in the table below, the total net interest income related to our securities lending activities would have been 156 million in the current quarter, compared to 181 million in the prior-year quarter. Such additional interest attributed to our securities lending activities would be reclassified from net interest income on Segregated cash and securities, net and Customer credit balances, net in the table below, so it would have no effect on our overall net interest income or net interest margin. Our Stock Yield Enhancement Program provides an opportunity for customers with fully-paid stock to allow us to lend it out. We pay customers a rebate on the cash collateral generally equal to 50 of a market-based rate for lending the shares. We place cash and/or U.S. Treasury securities as collateral securing the loans in the customer s account, which is held in segregated accounts or at an affiliate acting as collateral agent for the benefit of our customer.

 ______________________________ (1) Represents the average amount of customer cash swept into FDIC-insured banks as part of our Insured Bank Deposit Sweep Program. This item is not recorded in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. Income derived from program deposits is reported in other net interest income in the table above. (2) Interest income and interest expense on customer margin loans and customer credit balances, respectively, are calculated on daily cash balances within each customer s account on a net basis, which may result in an offset of balances across multiple account segments (e.g., between securities and commodities segments). (3) Includes income from financial instruments that has the same characteristics as interest, but is reported in other fees and services and other income in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 7 million and 6 million were reported in other fees and services, respectively, and 17 and 5 million were reported in other income, respectively. Non - Interest Expenses Non-interest expenses, for the current quarter, increased 151 million, or 50 , compared to the prior-year quarter, to 456 million, mainly due to a 108 million increase in general and administrative expenses, an 18 million increase in execution, clearing and distribution fees, an 18 million increase in employee compensation and benefits, and a 7 million increase in customer bad debt expense. As a percentage of total net revenues, non-interest expenses were 33 for the current quarter and 27 for the prior-year quarter.

Execution, Clearing and Distribution Fees Execution, clearing and distribution fees include the costs of executing and clearing trades, net of liquidity rebates received from various exchanges and market centers, as well as regulatory fees and market data fees. Execution fees are paid primarily to electronic exchanges and market centers on which we trade. Clearing fees are paid to clearing houses and clearing agents. Market data fees, which are associated with market data revenue included in other fees and services, are paid to third parties to receive streaming price quotes and related information. Execution, clearing and distribution fees, for the current quarter, increased 18 million, or 18 , compared to the prior-year quarter, to 116 million, mainly driven by a 17 million increase in SEC regulatory fees due to an increase in the SEC fee rate effective May 22, 2024, and higher customer trading volumes. SEC fees, as with other regulatory fees, are passed through to customers. As a percentage of total net revenues, execution, clearing and distribution fees were 8 for the current quarter and 9 for the prior-year quarter. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits include salaries, bonuses and other incentive compensation plans, group insurance, contributions to benefit programs and other related employee costs. Employee compensation and benefits expenses, for the current quarter, increased 18 million, or 14 , compared to the prior-year quarter, to 145 million, mainly due to inflation and a 1 increase in the average number of employees to 2,960 for the current quarter, compared to 2,918 for the prior-year quarter. As we continue to grow, our focus on automation has allowed us to maintain a relatively small staff. As a percentage of total net revenues, employee compensation and benefits expenses were 11 for both the current quarter and the prior-year quarter. As a percentage of total adjusted net revenues, employee compensation and benefits expenses were 11 for both the current quarter and the prior-year quarter. Occupancy, Depreciation and Amortization Occupancy expenses consist primarily of rental payments on office and data center leases and related occupancy costs, such as utilities. Depreciation and amortization expenses result from the depreciation of fixed assets, such as computing and communications hardware, as well as amortization of leasehold improvements and capitalized in - house software development. Occupancy, depreciation and amortization expenses, for the current quarter, increased 1 million, or 4 , compared to the prior-year quarter, to 26 million mainly due to higher costs related to the expansion of our data centers. As a percentage of total net revenues, occupancy, depreciation and amortization expenses were 2 for both the current quarter and the prior-year quarter. Communications Communications expenses consist primarily of the cost of voice and data telecommunications lines supporting our business, including connectivity to exchanges and market centers around the world. Communications expenses, for the current quarter, decreased 1 million, or 10 , compared to the prior-year quarter, to 9 million. As a percentage of total net revenues, communications expenses were 1 for both the current quarter and the prior-year quarter. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses consist primarily of advertising; professional services expenses, such as legal and audit work; legal and regulatory matters; and other operating expenses. General and administrative expenses, for the current quarter, increased 108 million, or 240 , compared to the prior-year quarter, to 153 million, primarily due to an 87 million increase related to legal and regulatory matters , a one-time charge of 12 million related to the consolidation of our European subsidiaries , and a 5 million increase in advertising expenses . As a percentage of total net revenues, general and administrative expenses were 11 for the current quarter and 4 for the prior-year quarter. Customer Bad Debt Customer bad debt expense consists primarily of losses incurred by customers in excess of their assets with us, net of amounts recovered by us. Customer bad debt expense, for the current quarter, increased 7 million, compared to the prior-year quarter, to 7 million, mainly due to customer losses during short periods of extreme market volatility.

Income Tax Expense We pay U.S. federal, state and local income taxes on our taxable income, which is proportional to the percentage we own of IBG LLC. Also, our operating subsidiaries are subject to income tax in the respective jurisdictions in which they operate. Income tax expense, for the current quarter , increased 7 million, or 10 , compared to the prior-year quarter, to 75 million, primarily due to (1) higher income before taxes at our operating subsidiaries outside the U.S. and higher income tax rates in Europe following the adoption of the minimum effective tax rate of 15 on January 1, 2024; (2) higher income before income taxes subject to U.S. income tax at IBG, Inc.; and (3) IBG, Inc. s higher average ownership percentage of IBG LLC, which rose from 25.2 in the prior-year quarter to 25.7 in the current quarter.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 current nine-month period compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 prior-year nine-month period Net Revenues Total net revenues, for the current nine-month period, increased 597 million, or 19 , compared to the prior-year nine-month period, to 3,798 million. The increase in net revenues was due to higher net interest income, commissions, other fees and services, and other income. Commissions Commissions, for the current nine-month period, increased 208 million, or 21 , compared to the prior-year nine-month period, to 1,220 million, driven by higher customer volume in options, futures and stocks. Total customer options and futures contract and stock share volumes increased 31 , 7 and 8 , respectively. Total DARTs for the current nine-month period increased 28 to 2.5 million, compared to 1.9 million for the prior-year nine-month period. Average commission per commissionable order for cleared customers, for the current nine-month period, decreased 7 to 2.92, compared to 3.13 for the prior-year nine-month period, due to smaller average order sizes in options, stocks and forex. Other Fees and Services Other fees and services, for the current nine-month period, increased 57 million, or 40 , compared to the prior-year nine-month period, to 199 million, driven by a 40 million increase in risk exposure fees as customers exhibited more risk-on behavior, a 9 million increase in payments for order flow from exchange-mandated programs driven by higher customer trading volumes, and a 7 million increase in FDIC sweep fees due to higher customer balances and benchmark interest rates. Other Income Other income, for the current nine-month period, increased 55 million, compared to the prior-year nine-month period, to a gain of 38 million. This increase was mainly comprised of 74 million related to our currency diversification strategy, which gained 3 million in the current nine-month period compared to a loss of 71 million in the prior-year nine-month period; and 50 million from our principal trading and investment activities; partially offset by a 48 million loss on positions taken over as customer accommodation due to a technical issue at the New York Stock Exchange that occurred on the morning of June 3, 2024, as previously disclosed, 8 million related to our strategic investment in Tiger Brokers, and 7 million from our U.S. government securities portfolio. Interest Income and Interest Expense Net interest income (interest income less interest expense), for the current nine-month period, increased 277 million, or 13 , compared to the prior-year nine-month period, to 2,341 million. The increase in net interest income was driven by higher customer margin loans and customer credit balances, and higher benchmark interest rates. Net interest income on customer balances, for the current nine-month period, increased 357 million, compared to the prior-year nine-month period, driven by a 10.5 billion increase in average customer margin loans, a 7.1 billion increase in average customer credit balances, and an increase in the average federal funds effective rate to 5.31 from 4.92 in the prior-year nine-month period. See the Business Environment section above in this Item 2 for a further discussion about the change in interest rates in the current quarter. The Company measures return on interest-earning assets using net interest margin NIM ). NIM is computed by dividing the annualized net interest income by the average interest-earning assets for the period. Interest-earning assets consist of cash and securities segregated for regulatory purposes (including U.S. government securities and securities purchased under agreements to resell) , customer margin loans, securities borrowed, other interest-earning assets (solely firm assets) and customer cash balances swept into FDIC-insured banks as part of our Insured Bank Deposit Sweep Program.

We pay customers a rebate on the cash collateral generally equal to 50 of a market-based rate for lending the shares. We place cash and/or U.S. Treasury securities as collateral securing the loans in the customer s account, which is held in segregated accounts or at an affiliate acting as collateral agent for the benefit of our customer.

 ______________________________ (1) Represents the average amount of customer cash swept into FDIC-insured banks as part of our Insured Bank Deposit Sweep Program. This item is not recorded in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. Income derived from program deposits is reported in other net interest income in the table above. (2) Interest income and interest expense on customer margin loans and customer credit balances, respectively, are calculated on daily cash balances within each customer s account on a net basis, which may result in an offset of balances across multiple account segments (e.g., between securities and commodities segments). (3) Includes income from financial instruments that has the same characteristics as interest, but is reported in other fees and services and other income in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 20 million and 14 million were reported in other fees and services, respectively, and 32 and 3 million were reported in other income, respectively. Non - Interest Expenses Non-interest expenses, for the current nine-month period, increased 195 million, or 21 , compared to the prior-year nine-month period, to 1,143 million, mainly due to a 89 million increase in general and administrative expense, a 46 million increase in execution, clearing and distribution fees, a 45 million increase in employee compensation and benefits, a 12 million increase in customer bad debt expense, and a 3 million increase in occupancy, depreciation and amortization expenses. As a percentage of total net revenues, non-interest expenses were 30 for both the current nine-month period and the prior-year nine-month period.

Execution, Clearing and Distribution Fees Execution, clearing and distribution fees, for the current nine-month period, increased 46 million, or 16 , compared to the prior-year nine-month period, to 332 million, mainly driven by a 23 million increase in SEC regulatory fees due to an increase in the SEC fee rate effective May 22, 2024 and higher customer trading volumes. SEC fees, as with other regulatory fees, are passed through to customers. As a percentage of total net revenues, execution, clearing and distribution fees were 9 for both the current nine-month period and the prior-year nine-month period. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expenses, for the current nine-month period, increased 45 million, or 12 , compared to the prior-year nine-month period, to 436 million, mainly due to inflation and a 2 increase in the average number of employees to 2,951 for the current nine-month period, compared to 2,882 for the prior-year nine-month period. As we continue to grow, our focus on automation has allowed us to maintain a relatively small staff. As a percentage of total net revenues, employee compensation and benefits expenses were 11 for the current nine-month period and 12 for the prior-year nine-month period. As a percentage of total adjusted net revenues, employee compensation and benefits expenses were 11 for the current nine-month period and 12 for the prior-year nine-month period. Occupancy, Depreciation and Amortization Occupancy, depreciation and amortization expenses, for the current nine-month period, increased 3 million, or 4 , compared to the prior-year nine-month period, to 77 million, mainly due to higher costs related to the expansion of our data centers. As a percentage of total net revenues, occupancy, depreciation and amortization expenses were 2 for both the current nine-month period and the prior-year nine-month period. Communications Communications expenses, for the current nine-month period were unchanged at 29 million. As a percentage of total net revenues, communications expenses were 1 for both the current nine-month period and the prior-year nine-month period. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses, for the current nine-month period, increased 89 million, or 54 , compared to the prior-year nine-month period, to 255 million, primarily due to a 58 million increase related to legal and regulatory matters, a one-time charge of 12 million related to the consolidation of our European subsidiaries , and a 12 million increase in advertising expenses . As a percentage of total net revenues, general and administrative expenses were 7 for the current nine-month period and 5 for the prior-year nine-month period. Customer Bad Debt Customer bad debt expense, for the current nine-month period, increased 12 million, compared to the prior-year nine-month period, to 14 million.

Income Tax Expense We pay U.S. federal, state and local income taxes on our taxable income, which is proportional to the percentage we own of IBG LLC. Also, our operating subsidiaries are subject to income tax in the respective jurisdictions in which they operate. Income tax expense, for the current nine-month period , increased 37 million, or 21 , compared to the prior-year nine-month period, to 217 million, primarily due to (1) higher income before taxes at our operating subsidiaries outside the U.S. and higher income tax rates in Europe following the adoption of the minimum effective tax rate of 15 on January 1, 2024; and (2) higher income before income taxes subject to U.S. income tax at IBG, Inc., additionally increased by IBG, Inc. s higher average ownership percentage of IBG LLC, which rose from 24.8 in the prior-year nine-month period to 25.6 in the current nine-month period. The table below presents information about our income tax expense for the periods indicated.

 Operating Results Income before income taxes, for the current nine-month period, increased 402 million, or 18 , compared to the prior-year nine-month period, to 2,655 million. Pretax profit margin was 70 for both the current nine-month period and the prior-year nine-month period. Comparing our operating results for the current nine-month period to the prior-year nine-month period using non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted net revenues were 3,833 million, up 19 ; adjusted income before income taxes was 2,690 million, up 19 ; and adjusted pre-tax profit margin was 70 for the current nine-month period and 71 for the prior-year nine-month period. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section below in this Item 2 for additional details.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures We use certain non-GAAP financial measures as additional measures to enhance the understanding of our financial results. These non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted net revenues, adjusted income before income taxes, adjusted net income available for common stockholders and adjusted diluted earnings per share EPS ). We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are important measures of our financial performance because they exclude certain items that may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and analysts in evaluating the operating performance of the business. We define adjusted net revenues as net revenues adjusted to remove the effect of our currency diversification strategy and our net mark-to-market gains (losses) on investments. We define adjusted income before income taxes as income before income taxes adjusted to remove the effect of our currency diversification strategy and our net mark-to-market gains (losses) on investments. We define adjusted net income available to common stockholders as net income available for common stockholders adjusted to remove the after-tax effects attributable to IBG, Inc. of our currency diversification strategy and our net mark-to-market gains (losses) on investments. We define adjusted diluted EPS as adjusted net income available for common stockholders divided by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period. Mark-to-market on investments represents the net mark-to-market gains (losses) on investments in equity securities that do not qualify for equity method accounting which are measured at fair value, on our U.S. government and municipal securities portfolios, which are typically held to maturity, and on certain other investments, including equity securities taken over by the Company from customers as a customer accommodation due to a technical issue at the New York Stock Exchange on the morning of June 3, 2024. In the event an investment is sold prior to maturity, accumulated gains (losses) are realized and previously accumulated non-GAAP adjustments are reversed in the period of sale. We also report compensation and benefits expenses as a percentage of adjusted net revenues, as we believe this measure is useful to investors and analysts in evaluating the growth of our workforce in relation to the growth of our core revenues. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP 1 . __________________________ (1) Refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

Liquidity and Capital Resources We maintain a highly liquid balance sheet. The majority of our assets consists of investments of customer funds, collateralized receivables arising from customer - related and proprietary securities transactions, and exchange - listed marketable securities, which are marked - to - market daily. Collateralized receivables consist primarily of customer margin loans, securities borrowed, and securities purchased under agreements to resell. As of September 30, 2024, total assets were 148.5 billion of which approximately 147.1 billion, or 99.0 , were considered liquid. Decisions on the allocation of capital are based upon, among other things, prudent risk management guidelines, potential liquidity and cash flow needs for current and future business activities, regulatory capital requirements, and projected profitability. Our Treasury department, Market Risk Committee, Enterprise Risk Management department and other management control groups assist in evaluating, monitoring and controlling the impact that our business activities have on our financial condition, liquidity and capital structure. The objective of these policies is to support our business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity. Our significant capital comprises an aggregate across our many regulated subsidiaries, and in addition to supporting our current business and future expansion plans we believe this financial strength provides our customers with a source of confidence. Daily monitoring of liquidity needs and available collateral levels is undertaken to help ensure that an appropriate liquidity cushion, in the form of cash and unpledged collateral, is maintained at all times. We actively manage our excess liquidity and maintain significant borrowing capabilities through the securities lending markets and in the form of credit facilities with banks. As a general practice, we maintain sufficient levels of cash on hand to provide us with a buffer should we need immediately available funds for any reason. In addition, pursuant to our liquidity risk management plan we perform periodic liquidity stress tests, which are designed to identify and reserve liquid assets that would be available under market or idiosyncratic stress events. Based on our current level of operations, we believe our cash flows from operations, available cash and available borrowings will be adequate to meet our future liquidity needs for more than the next twelve months. As of September 30, 2024, liability balances in connection with short-term borrowings, securities loaned, and payables to customers were higher than the average monthly balance during the current quarter. Cash and cash equivalents held by our non - U.S. operating subsidiaries as of September 30, 2024 were 1,699 million 1,625 million as of December 31, 2023). These funds are primarily intended to finance each individual operating subsidiary s local operations, and thus would not be available to fund U.S. domestic operations unless repatriated through payment of dividends to IBG LLC. As of September 30, 2024, we had no intention to repatriate any amounts from non-U.S. operating subsidiaries. With the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017 , we recognized a liability for the one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of earnings of some of our foreign subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2017. As a result, in the event dividends were to be paid to the Company in the future by a non - U.S. operating subsidiaries, the Company would not be required to accrue and pay income taxes on such dividends, except for foreign taxes in the form of dividend withholding tax, and in connection with accumulated other comprehensive income/loss from currency exchange rate changes not previously taxed in the U.S., if any, imposed on the recipient of the distribution or dividend distribution tax imposed on the payor of the distribution. Historically, our consolidated equity has consisted primarily of accumulated retained earnings, which to date have been sufficient to fund our operations and growth. Our consolidated equity increased 21 to 16.0 billion as of September 30, 2024, from 13.3 billion as of September 30, 2023. This increase is attributable to total comprehensive income, partially offset by distributions and dividends paid during the last four quarters.

Cash Flows The table below presents our cash flows from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the periods indicated. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities 6,886 2,175 Net cash used in investing activities (62) (27) Net cash used in financing activities (647) (516) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 41 (26) Increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 6,218 1,606 
 Our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash (i.e., cash and cash equivalents that are subject to withdrawal or usage restrictions) increased by 6,218 million to 38.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Operating Activities Our cash flows from operating activities are largely a reflection of the changes in customer credit and margin loan balances. We raised 6.9 billion in net cash from operating activities mainly driven by customer credit balances which increased 11.6 billion, securities loaned which increased 5.5 billion, and investments in securities segregated for regulatory purposes which decreased 4.3 billion; partially offset by customer margin loans which increased 11.5 billion. Investing Activities Our cash flows from investing activities are primarily related to other investments, capitalized internal software development, purchases and sales of memberships, trading rights and shares at exchanges where we trade, and strategic investments where such investments may enable us to offer better execution alternatives to our current and prospective customers, allow us to influence exchanges to provide competing products at better prices using sophisticated technology, or enable us to acquire either technology or customers faster than we could develop them on our own. We used net cash of 62 million in our investing activities primarily for purchases of property, equipment, and intangible assets and other investments. Financing Activities Our cash flows from financing activities are comprised of short-term borrowings, capital transactions, and payments made to Holdings under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Short-term borrowings from banks are part of our daily cash management in support of operating activities. Capital transactions consist primarily of quarterly dividends paid to common stockholders and related distributions paid to Holdings. We used net cash of 647 million in our financing activities, primarily for distributions to noncontrolling interests, dividends paid to common stockholders, and payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Nine months Ended September 30, 2023 : For a discussion of changes in cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 refer to our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August 7, 2023. Regulatory Capital Requirements As of September 30, 2024, all operating subsidiaries were in compliance with their respective regulatory capital requirements. For additional information regarding our regulatory capital requirements see Note 15 Regulatory Requirements to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Capital Expenditures Our capital expenditures are comprised of compensation costs of our software engineering staff for development of software for internal use and expenditures for computer, networking and communications hardware, and leasehold improvements. These expenditure items are reported as property, equipment, and intangible assets. Capital expenditures for property, equipment, and intangible assets were approximately 34 million and 40 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In the future, we plan to meet capital expenditure needs with cash from operations and cash on hand, as we continue our focus on technology infrastructure initiatives to further enhance our competitive position. In response to changing economic conditions, we believe we have the flexibility to modify our capital expenditures by adjusting them (either upward or downward) to match our actual performance. If we pursue any additional strategic acquisitions, we may incur additional capital expenditures.

Seasonality Our businesses are subject to seasonal fluctuations, reflecting varying numbers of market participants at times during the year, varying numbers of trading days from quarter - to - quarter, and declines in trading activity due to holidays. Typical seasonal trends may be superseded by market or world events, which can have a significant impact on prices and trading volume. Inflation Although we cannot accurately anticipate the effects of inflation on our operations, we believe that, for the past several years, inflation may have indirectly had a material impact on our results of operations. Inflation has been one of the factors driving our employee compensation and benefits expenses higher during the current period, although as a percentage of net revenues these expenses remain stable. In an effort to stem inflation, central banks have increased benchmark interest rates in most currencies, which has contributed to our net interest income. Inflation may also be a contributing factor to general uncertainty in the markets in the foreseeable future. Statements about future inflation are subject to the risk that actual inflation and its effects may differ, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in economic growth, impact of supply chain disruptions, unemployment and consumer demand. Investments in U.S. Government Securities We invest in U.S. government securities to satisfy U.S. regulatory requirements. As a broker-dealer, unlike banks, we are required to mark these investments to market even though we intend to hold them to maturity. Sudden increases (decreases) in interest rates will cause mark-to-market losses (gains) on these securities, which are recovered (eliminated) if we hold them to maturity, as currently intended. As of September 30, 2024, all of our U.S. government securities had maturities within three months. The impact of changes in interest rates is further described in Part I, Item 3 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q entitled Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Strategic Investments and Acquisitions We regularly evaluate potential strategic investments and acquisitions. We hold strategic investments in certain electronic trading exchanges, including BOX Options Exchange, LLC. We also hold strategic investments in certain businesses, including Tiger Brokers, an online stock brokerage established for Chinese retail and institutional customers, and Zero Hash Holdings Ltd., a crypto-service provider, in which as of September 30, 2024 we had beneficial ownership interests of 6.2 and 31.6 , respectively. We intend to continue making acquisitions on an opportunistic basis, generally only when the acquisition candidate will, in our opinion, enable us to offer better execution alternatives to our current and prospective customers, allow us to influence exchanges to provide competing products at better prices using sophisticated technology, or enable us to acquire either technology or customers faster than we could develop them on our own. As of September 30, 2024, there were no definitive agreements with respect to any material acquisition. Certain Information Concerning Off - Balance - Sheet Arrangements We may be exposed to a risk of loss not reflected in our condensed consolidated financial statements for futures products, which represent our obligations to settle at contracted prices, and which may require us to repurchase or sell in the market at prevailing prices. Accordingly, these transactions result in off - balance sheet risk, as our cost to liquidate such futures contracts may exceed the amounts reported in our condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates and assumptions are based on judgment and the best available information at the time. Therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates. We believe that the critical policies listed below represent the most significant estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. See Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 Table of Contents 

Contingencies Our policy is to estimate and accrue for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings, to the extent that such losses are probable and can be estimated. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different. Our total liability accrued with respect to litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case-by-case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses based on, among other factors, the progress of each case, our experience with and industry experience with similar cases and the opinions and views of internal and external legal counsel. Given the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of litigation and regulatory matters, particularly in cases or proceedings in which substantial or indeterminate damages or fines are sought, or where cases or proceedings are in the early stages, we cannot estimate losses or ranges of losses for cases or proceedings where there is only a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred. Income Taxes Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits are based on enacted tax laws and reflect management s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Determining income tax expense requires significant judgment and estimates. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of the underlying assets and liabilities. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdictions from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax - planning strategies, and results of recent operations. In projecting future taxable income, historical results are adjusted for changes in accounting policies and incorporate assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and foreign pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax - planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, three years of cumulative operating income (loss) are considered. Deferred income taxes have not been provided for U.S. tax liabilities or for additional foreign taxes on the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have been indefinitely reinvested. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. For example, on December 15, 2022, the European Union EU formally adopted the EU s Pillar Two Directive, effective January 1, 2024, which provides for a minimum effective tax rate of 15 , as established by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD Pillar Two Framework. A significant number of other countries have either already or are expected to implement similar legislation with varying effective dates. We record tax liabilities in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB ASC Topic 740 and adjust these liabilities when management s judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in payments that are different from the current estimates of these tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information becomes available. We recognize that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. A tax position that meets this standard is measured at the largest amount of benefit that will more likely than not be realized on settlement. Accounting Pronouncements Issued but Not Yet Adopted For additional information regarding FASB Accounting Standards Updates ASU s) that have been issued but not yet adopted and that may impact the Company, refer to Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on form 10-Q.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to various market risks. Our exposures to market risks arise from assumptions built into our pricing models, equity price risk, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our international operations, changes in interest rates and risks relating to the extension of margin credit to our customers. Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, implied volatilities (the price volatility of the underlying instrument imputed from option prices), correlations or other market factors, such as market liquidity, will result in losses for a position or portfolio. Generally, we incur trading - related market risk as a result of our remaining market making activities, where the substantial majority of our Value - at - Risk VaR for market risk exposures is generated. In addition, we incur non - trading - related market risk primarily from investment activities and from foreign currency exposure held in the equity of our foreign subsidiaries, i.e., our non - U.S. brokerage subsidiaries and information technology subsidiaries, and held to meet target balances in our currency diversification strategy. We use various risk management tools in managing our market risk, which are embedded in our real - time market making systems. We employ certain hedging and risk management techniques to protect us from a severe market dislocation. Our risk management policies are developed and implemented by our Steering Committee, which is chaired by our Chief Executive Officer and comprised of senior executives of our various operating subsidiaries. The strategy of our remaining market making activities is to calculate quotes a few seconds ahead of the market and execute small trades at a tiny but favorable differential as a result. This strategy is made possible by our proprietary pricing model, which evaluates and monitors the risks inherent in our portfolio, assimilates external market data and reevaluates the outstanding quotes in our portfolio many times per second. Our model automatically rebalances our positions throughout each trading day to manage risk exposures on our options and futures positions and the underlying securities and will price the increased risk that a position would add to the overall portfolio into the bid and offer prices we post. Under risk management policies implemented and monitored primarily through our computer systems, reports to management, including risk profiles, profit and loss analysis and trading performance, are prepared on a real - time basis as well as daily and periodical bases. Although our remaining market making activities are completely automated, the trading process and our risk are monitored by a team of individuals who, in real time, observe various risk parameters of our consolidated positions. Our assets and liabilities are marked - to - market daily for financial reporting purposes and re - valued continuously throughout the trading day for risk management and asset/liability management purposes. We use a covariant VaR methodology to measure, monitor and review the market risk of our market making portfolios, with the exception of fixed income products, and our currency exposures. The risk of fixed income products, which comprise primarily U.S. government securities, is measured using a stress test. Pricing Model Exposure As described above, our proprietary pricing model, which continuously evaluates and monitors the risks inherent in our portfolio, assimilates external market data and reevaluates the outstanding quotes in our entire portfolio many times per second. Certain aspects of the model rely on historical prices of securities. If the behavior of price movements of individual securities diverges substantially from what their historical behavior would predict, we might incur trading losses. We attempt to limit such risks by diversifying our portfolio across many different options, futures and underlying securities and avoiding concentrations of positions based on the same underlying security. Historically, our losses from these events have been immaterial in comparison to our annual trading profits. Foreign Currency Exposure As a result of our international activities and accumulated earnings in our non-U.S. subsidiaries, our income and equity are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. For example, our non-U.S. subsidiaries are exposed to foreign exchange risks as described below: Some of our non-U.S. subsidiaries support customer transactions in financial instruments, carry bank balances, and borrow and lend securities in various currencies in their regular course of business. At the end of each accounting period, these non-U.S. subsidiaries assets and liabilities are revalued into their respective functional currencies for presentation in their financial statements. The resulting foreign currency gains or losses are reported in their income statements and, as translated into U.S. dollars for U.S. GAAP purposes, in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income, as a component of Other income. These non-U.S. subsidiaries financial statements are presented in their respective functional currencies, as noted above. For U.S. GAAP purposes, at the end of each accounting period, each non-U.S. subsidiary s equity is translated at the then prevailing exchange rate into U.S. dollars and the resulting translation gain or loss is reported as OCI in our condensed consolidated statements of financial condition and condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

By periodically converting currency balances into functional currency, we substantially reduce the foreign currency exposures for each of these non-U.S. subsidiaries, which minimizes the impact of exchange rate changes to its income statement. However, historically, we have taken the approach of not hedging our consolidated foreign currency exposures to the U.S. dollar, based on the notion that the cost of constantly hedging over the years would amount to more than the random impact of rate changes on our non - U.S. dollar balances. Instead, because we conduct business in many countries and many currencies and because we consider ourselves a global enterprise based in a diversified basket of currencies rather than a U.S. dollar-based company, we actively manage our global currency exposure by maintaining our equity in GLOBALs, a basket of currencies. Our risk management systems incorporate cash forex to hedge our currency exposure at little or no cost. Currency spot positions entered into as part of our currency diversification strategy are held by the parent holding company, IBG LLC. The U.S. dollar value of the GLOBAL increased 1.24 as of September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 25 of our equity was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The effects of our currency diversification strategy appear in two places in the condensed consolidated financial statements: (1) as a component of Other income in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income and (2) as OCI in the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition and the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The full effect of the GLOBAL is captured in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The table below presents a comparison of the U.S. dollar equivalent of the GLOBAL for the periods indicated.

 Interest Rate Risk We had no variable - rate debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024. We pay our customers interest based on benchmark overnight interest rates in various currencies, when interest rates are above a benchmark rate plus a small spread, on cash balances above 10 thousand (or equivalent) in securities accounts holding more than 100 thousand and at lower, tiered rates for accounts holding less than 100 thousand (or equivalent) net asset value. In currencies with negative rates, we pass through the cost of holding certain cash balances to our customers; therefore, we charge our customers interest on these cash balances. In a normal rate environment, we typically invest a portion of these funds in U.S. government securities with maturities of up to two years, although given the current interest rate environment, at this time all such investments mature within three months. If interest rates were to increase rapidly and substantially, our net interest income would not increase proportionally with the interest rates for the portion of the funds invested at fixed yields. In addition, the mark-to-market changes in the value of these fixed rate securities will be reflected in other income, instead of net interest income. Our margin balances are priced to a benchmark rate plus a spread, with a minimum charge of 0.75 in U.S. dollars and most foreign currencies. Based on customer balances and investments outstanding as of September 30, 2024, and assuming reinvestment of maturing instruments in instruments of short-term duration, an unexpected increase of 0.25 over current U.S. dollar interest rate levels would increase our net interest income by approximately 64 million on an annualized basis, assuming the full effect of reinvestment at higher rates. A 0.25 increase in all the relevant non-U.S. dollar benchmark rates would increase our net interest income by approximately 20 million on an annualized basis. Our interest rate sensitivity estimate contains separate assumptions for U.S. dollar rates from other currencies rates and it isolates the effects of a rate increase on reinvestments. We do not approximate mark-to-market impact from interest rate changes; if U.S. government securities whose prices were to fall under these scenarios were held to maturity, as intended, then the reduction in other income would be temporary, as the securities would mature at par value. If such securities were sold prior to maturity, the loss would be realized and the proceeds reinvested at prevailing higher interest rates.

We also face the potential for reduced net interest income from customer deposits and margin loans if benchmark rates were to fall. Based on customer balances and investments outstanding as of September 30, 2024 , and assuming reinvestment of maturing instruments in instruments of short-term duration, an unexpected decrease in U.S. dollar interest rates of 0.25 would decrease our net interest income by approximately 64 million on an annualized basis, assuming the full effect of reinvestment at lower rates. A 0.25 decrease in all the relevant non-U.S. dollar benchmark rates would decrease our net interest income by approximately 18 million on an annualized basis. We also face interest rate risk due to positions carried for our remaining market making activities to the extent that long or short stock positions may have been established for future or forward dates on options or futures contracts and the value of such positions is impacted by interest rates. The amount of such risk cannot be quantified, however, the current low level of market making positions does not indicate a material potential exposure. Dividend Risk We face dividend risk in our remaining market making activities as we derive revenues and incur expenses in the form of dividend income and expense, respectively, from our inventory of equity securities, and must make payments in lieu of dividends on short positions in equity securities within our portfolio. Projected future dividends are an important component of pricing equity options and other derivatives, and incorrect projections may lead to trading losses. The amount of such risk cannot be quantified, however, the current low level of market making positions does not indicate a material potential exposure. Margin Loans We extend margin loans to our customers, which are subject to various regulatory requirements. Margin loans are collateralized by cash and securities in the customers accounts. The risks associated with margin credit increase during periods of fast market movements or in cases where collateral is concentrated and market movements occur. During such times, customers who utilize margin loans and who have collateralized their obligations with securities may find that the securities have a rapidly depreciating value and may not be sufficient to cover their obligations in the event of a liquidation. We are also exposed to credit risk when our customers execute transactions, such as short sales of options and equities that can expose them to risk beyond their invested capital. We expect this kind of exposure to increase with the growth of our overall business. Because we indemnify and hold harmless our clearing houses and counterparties from certain liabilities or claims, the use of margin loans and short sales may expose us to significant off - balance - sheet risk if collateral requirements are not sufficient to fully cover losses that customers may incur and those customers fail to satisfy their obligations. As of September 30, 2024, we had 56.0 billion in margin loans extended to our customers. The amount of risk to which we are exposed from the margin loans we extend to our customers and from short sale transactions by our customers is unlimited and not quantifiable as the risk is dependent upon analysis of a potentially significant and undeterminable rise or fall in stock prices. Our account level margin requirements meet or exceed those required by Regulation T of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve and FINRA portfolio margin rules, as applicable. As a matter of practice, we enforce real - time margin compliance monitoring and liquidate customers positions if their equity falls below required margin requirements. We have a comprehensive policy implemented in accordance with regulatory standards to assess and monitor the suitability of investors to engage in various trading activities. To mitigate our risk, we also continuously monitor customer accounts to detect excessive concentration, large orders or positions, patterns of day trading and other activities that indicate increased risk to us. Our credit exposure is to a great extent mitigated by our real-time margining system, which automatically evaluates each account throughout the trading day and closes out positions automatically for accounts that are found to be under - margined. While this methodology is effective in most situations, it may not be effective in situations where no liquid market exists for the relevant securities or commodities or where, for any reason, automatic liquidation for certain accounts has been disabled. Our Risk Management Committee continually monitors and evaluates our risk management policies, including the implementation of policies and procedures to enhance the detection and prevention of potential events to mitigate margin loan losses.

Value - at - Risk We estimate VaR using a historical approach, which uses the historical daily price returns of underlying assets as well as estimates of the end of day implied volatility for options. Our one - day VaR is defined as the unrealized loss in portfolio value that, based on historically observed market risk factors, would have been exceeded with a frequency of one percent, based on a calculation with a confidence interval of 99 . Our VaR model generally takes into account exposures to equity and commodity price risk and foreign exchange rates. We use VaR as one of a range of risk management tools. Among their benefits, VaR models permit the estimation of a portfolio s aggregate market risk exposure, incorporating a range of varied market risks and portfolio assets. One key element of the VaR model is that it reflects risk reduction due to portfolio diversification or hedging activities. However, VaR has various strengths and limitations, which include, but are not limited to: use of historical changes in market risk factors, which may not be accurate predictors of future market conditions, and may not fully incorporate the risk of extreme market events that are outsized relative to observed historical market behavior or reflect the historical distribution of results beyond the confidence interval; and reporting of losses in a single day, which does not reflect the risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or hedged in one day. A small proportion of market risk generated by trading positions is not included in VaR. The modeling of the risk characteristics of some positions relies on approximations that, under certain circumstances, could produce significantly different results from those produced using more precise measures. VaR is most appropriate as a risk measure for trading positions in liquid financial markets and will understate the risk associated with severe events, such as periods of extreme illiquidity. The VaR calculation simulates the performance of the portfolio based on several years of daily price changes of the underlying assets and determines the VaR as the calculated loss that occurs at the 99 th percentile. Since the reported VaR statistics are estimates based on historical data, VaR should not be viewed as predictive of our future revenues or financial performance or of our ability to monitor and manage risk. There can be no assurance that our actual losses on a particular day will not exceed the indicated VaR or that such losses will not occur more than one time in 100 trading days. VaR does not predict the magnitude of losses which, should they occur, may be significantly greater than the VaR amount. Stress Test We estimate the market risk of our fixed income portfolio using a risk analysis model provided by a leading external vendor. For corporate bonds, this stress test is configured to calculate the change in value of each fixed income security in the portfolio over one day in five scenarios each of which represents a parallel shift of the U.S. Treasury yield curve. The scenarios are shifts of +/ 100 and +/ 200 basis points. For U.S. government securities, the stress test is configured to calculate the change in value of each fixed income security in the portfolio over one day in three scenarios each of which represents a parallel shift of the U.S. Treasury yield curve. The scenarios are shifts of +/ 50 basis points.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are effective, in all material respects, to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In addition, no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the period covered by this report quarter that has materially affected, or is likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We have not experienced any material impact to our internal controls over financial reporting related to our employees working remotely.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Part 1, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 27, 2024. ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS Purchases of IBG LLC membership interests, held by Holdings, by the Company are governed by the Amended Exchange Agreement, which was filed on Exhibit 10.1 to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for Quarterly Period Ended September 30, 2015 filed by the Company on November 9, 2015. At the time of the Company s IPO in 2007, three hundred sixty (360) million shares of authorized common stock were reserved for future sales and redemptions. On an annual basis, each holder of a membership interest may request that some or all of that holder s interest be redeemed by Holdings. We expect Holdings to use the net proceeds it receives from such sales to redeem an identical number of Holdings membership interests from the requesting holders. With the consent of Holdings and the Company (on its own behalf and acting as the sole managing member of IBG LLC), IBG LLC agreed in July 2024 to redeem certain membership interests from Holdings through the sale of common stock and the distribution of the proceeds of such sale to the beneficial owners of such membership interests. On July 25, 2024, the Company filed a Prospectus Supplement on Form 424B5 with the SEC to issue 333,000 shares of common stock (with a fair value of 39 million) in exchange for an equivalent number of shares of member interest in IBG LLC. The acquired shares were distributed in-kind to the members of Holdings who elected to redeem a portion of their Holdings membership interests. ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES None
