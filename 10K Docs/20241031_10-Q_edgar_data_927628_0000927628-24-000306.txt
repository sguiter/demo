 INTRODUCTION 
 Capital One Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation established in 1994 and headquartered in McLean, Virginia, is a diversified financial services holding company with banking and non-banking subsidiaries. Capital One Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company or Capital One offer a broad array of financial products and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients through digital channels, branch locations, caf s and other distribution channels. 
 As of September 30, 2024, Capital One Financial Corporation s principal operating subsidiary was Capital One, National Association CONA ). The Company is hereafter collectively referred to as we, us or our. CONA is referred to as the Bank. 
 Our consolidated total net revenues are derived primarily from lending to consumer and commercial customers net of funding costs associated with our deposits, long-term debt and other borrowings. We also earn non-interest income which primarily consists of interchange income, net of reward expenses, service charges and other customer-related fees. Our expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating expenses, marketing expenses and income taxes. 
 Our principal operations are organized for management reporting purposes into three major business segments, which are defined primarily based on the products and services provided or the types of customers served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into or managed as a part of our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a business segment are included in the Other category, such as the management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability positions performed by our centralized Corporate Treasury group and any residual tax expense or benefit beyond what is assessed to our business segments in order to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate. The Other category also includes unallocated corporate expenses that do not directly support the operations of the business segments or for which the business segments are not considered financially accountable in evaluating their performance, such as certain restructuring charges and integration expenses related to the agreement to acquire Discover. 
 Credit Card: Consists of our domestic consumer and small business card lending, and international card businesses in the United Kingdom U.K. and Canada. 
 Consumer Banking: Consists of our deposit gathering and lending activities for consumers and small businesses, and national auto lending. 
 Commercial Banking: Consists of our lending, deposit gathering, capital markets and treasury management services to commercial real estate and commercial and industrial customers. Our customers typically include companies with annual revenues between 20 million and 2 billion.

 Business Developments 
 We regularly explore and evaluate opportunities to acquire financial products and services as well as financial assets, including credit card and other loan portfolios, and enter into strategic partnerships as part of our growth strategy. We also explore opportunities to acquire technology companies and related assets to improve our information technology infrastructure and to deliver on our digital strategy. We may issue equity or debt to fund our acquisitions. In addition, we regularly consider the potential disposition of certain of our assets, branches, partnership agreements or lines of business. 
 Agreement to Acquire Discover 
 On February 19, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the Merger Agreement ), by and among Capital One, Discover Financial Services, a Delaware corporation Discover and Vega Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of the Company Merger Sub ), pursuant to which (a) Merger Sub will merge with and into Discover, with Discover as the surviving entity in the merger (the Merger (b) immediately following the Merger, Discover, as the surviving entity, will merge with and into Capital One, with Capital One as the surviving entity in the second-step merger (the Second Step Merger and (c) immediately following the Second Step Merger, Discover Bank, a Delaware-chartered and wholly owned subsidiary of Discover, will merge with and into CONA, with CONA as the surviving entity in the merger (the CONA Bank Merger, and collectively with the Merger and the Second Step Merger, the Transaction ). The Merger Agreement was unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of each of Capital One and Discover. 
 At the effective time of the Merger, each share of common stock of Discover outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, other than certain shares held by Discover or Capital One, will be converted into the right to receive 1.0192 shares of common stock of Capital One. Holders of Discover common stock will receive cash in lieu of fractional shares. At the effective time of the Second Step Merger, each share of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series C, of Discover, and each share of 6.125 Fixed-Rate Reset Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series D, of Discover, in each case outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Second Step Merger, will be converted into the right to receive a share of newly created series of preferred stock of Capital One having terms that are not materially less favorable than the applicable series of Discover preferred stock. The closing of the Transaction is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals and approval by the stockholders of each of Capital One and Discover. 
 Walmart Program Agreement Termination 
 On May 21, 2024, our credit card program agreement with Walmart terminated Walmart Program Termination ). Pursuant to terms of the termination, Capital One retained ownership and servicing of the existing credit card portfolio of approximately 8.5 billion of loans. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company began converting eligible customers and integrating the accounts into Capital One branded card products, which may result in elevated operational and performance uncertainties as this portfolio converts to branded products. 
 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Final Rule 
 On March 5, 2024, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB issued a final rule amending Regulation Z that, if it goes into effect as currently issued, would significantly lower the safe harbor amount for past due fees that a large credit card issuer, including the Bank, can charge on consumer credit card accounts. The final rule is currently stayed as a result of ongoing litigation. 
 The final rule, if it goes into effect as currently issued, would have a significant impact on our revenue, as well as potentially significant marketplace effects, including effects on competition, pricing, consumer behaviors, volumes, and credit. In response to the final rule, we have developed a number of mitigating actions and some of these mitigating actions have been implemented. Other actions may be implemented as a result of the final rule. 
 For more information on risks related to this rule, see the risk factors set forth under Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K.

 SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA 
 The following table presents selected consolidated financial data and performance from our results of operations for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 and 2023 and selected comparative balance sheet data as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. We also provide selected key metrics we use in evaluating our performance, including certain metrics that are computed using non-GAAP measures. We consider these metrics to be key financial measures that management uses in assessing our operating performance, capital adequacy and the level of returns generated. We believe these non-GAAP metrics provide useful insight to investors and users of our financial information as they provide an alternate measurement of our performance and assist in assessing our capital adequacy and the level of return generated. These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as a substitute for reported results determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ), nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP measures that may be presented by other companies.

 Below are additional highlights of our performance in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024. These highlights are based on a comparison between the results of the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 and 2023, except as otherwise noted. The changes in our financial condition and credit performance are generally based on our financial condition and credit performance as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. We provide a more detailed discussion of our financial performance in the sections following this Executive Summary. 
 Total Company Performance 
 Earnings: 
 Our net income decreased by 13 million to 1.8 billion in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily driven by: 
 Higher provision for credit losses in the third quarter of 2024 primarily driven by higher net charge-offs, including the impacts of the elimination of loss sharing provisions due to the Walmart Program Termination, partially offset by allowance releases compared to a net allowance build in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Higher non-interest expense primarily driven by growth in our Credit Card business and increased marketing spend. 
 These drivers were partially offset by: 
 Higher net-interest income primarily driven by higher average loan balances and margins in our credit card loan portfolio, including the impacts of the elimination of revenue sharing provisions due to the Walmart Program Termination. 
 Our net income decreased by 527 million to 3.7 billion in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily driven by: 
 Higher provision for credit losses in the first nine months of 2024 primarily driven by higher net charge-offs in Domestic Card, partially offset by a lower net allowance build. 
 Higher non-interest expense primarily driven by growth in our Credit Card business and increased marketing spend. 
 These drivers were partially offset by: 
 Higher net-interest income primarily driven by higher average loan balances and margins in our credit card loan portfolio, including the impacts of the elimination of revenue sharing provisions due to the Walmart Program Termination, partially offset by higher rates paid on interest-bearing deposits.

Table of Contents 

 Period-end loans held for investment decreased by 229 million to 320.2 billion as of September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023 primarily driven by customer payments outpacing originations in our commercial loan portfolio, partially offset by growth in our credit card and auto loan portfolios. 
 Average loans held for investment increased by 5.5 billion to 318.3 billion in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 and increased by 5.9 billion to 315.9 billion in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily driven by growth in our credit card loan portfolio, partially offset by customer payments outpacing originations in our commercial loan portfolio. 
 Net Charge-Off and Delinquency Metrics: 
 Our net charge-off rate increased by 71 basis points bps to 3.27 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 and increased by 79 bps to 3.32 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily driven by higher net charge-offs in our credit card loan portfolio. 
 Our 30+ day delinquency rate decreased by 10 bps to 3.89 as of September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023 primarily driven by lower delinquency inventories in our auto loan portfolio. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses: Our allowance for credit losses increased by 1.2 billion to 16.5 billion and our allowance coverage ratio increased by 39 bps to 5.16 as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 primarily driven by an allowance build due to the Walmart Program Termination in the second quarter of 2024. 
 
 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The section below provides a comparative discussion of our consolidated financial performance for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 and 2023. We provide a discussion of our business segment results in the following section, Business Segment Financial Performance. This section should be read together with our Executive Summary, where we discuss trends and other factors that we expect will affect our future results of operations. 
 
 Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income represents the difference between interest income, including certain fees, earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense incurred on our interest-bearing liabilities. Our interest-earning assets include loans, investment securities and other interest-earning assets, while our interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing deposits, securitized debt obligations, senior and subordinated notes, other borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. Generally, we include in interest income any past due fees, net of reversals, on loans that we deem collectible. Our net interest margin, based on our consolidated results, represents the difference between the yield on our interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities, including the notional impact of non-interest-bearing funding. We expect net interest income and our net interest margin to fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.

 6.83 6.59 __________ 
 (1) Average yield is calculated based on annualized interest income for the period divided by average loans during the period. Annualized interest income does not include any allocations, such as funds transfer pricing. Average yield is calculated using whole dollar values for average balances and interest income/expense. 
 (2) Past due fees, net of reversals, included in interest income totaled approximately 626 million and 1.7 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, and 593 million and 1.6 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 , respectively. 
 (3) Some of our commercial investments generate tax-exempt income, tax credits or other tax benefits. Accordingly, we present our Commercial Banking revenue and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated using the federal statutory tax rate of 21 and state taxes where applicable, with offsetting reductions to the Other category. Taxable-equivalent adjustments included in the interest income and yield computations for our commercial loans totaled approximately 20 million and 59 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, and 18 million and 55 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively, with corresponding reductions to the Other category. 
 (4) Interest income/expense in the Other category represents the impact of hedge accounting on our loan portfolios and the offsetting reduction of the taxable-equivalent adjustments of our commercial loans as described above.

Related interest expense was 7 million and 23 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, and 8 million and 24 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. 
 (6) The Walmart Program Termination increased net interest margin by 22 bps and 11 bps in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024. 
 Not meaningful. 
 Net interest income increased by 653 million to 8.1 billion in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily driven by higher average loan balances and margins in our credit card loan portfolio, including the impacts of the elimination of revenue sharing provisions due to the Walmart Program Termination. Net interest income increased by 1.4 billion to 23.1 billion in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily driven by higher average loan balances and margins in our credit card loan portfolio, including the impacts of the elimination of revenue sharing provisions due to the Walmart Program Termination, partially offset by higher rates paid on interest-bearing deposits. 
 Net interest margin increased by 42 bps to 7.11 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 and increased by 24 bps to 6.83 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily driven by higher asset yields and growth in our credit card loan portfolio, partially offset by higher rates paid on interest-bearing deposits. 
 Our total company cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta was 62 as of June 30, 2024, prior to the Federal Reserve reducing the target federal funds rate during the third quarter of 2024, which marked the beginning of a new rate cycle.

 Provision for Credit Losses 
 Our provision for credit losses in each period is driven by net charge-offs, changes to the allowance for credit losses and changes to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. Our provision for credit losses increased by 198 million to 2.5 billion in the third quarter of 2024 primarily driven by higher net charge-offs, including the impacts of the elimination of loss sharing provisions due to the Walmart Program Termination, partially offset by an allowance release compared to an allowance build in the third quarter of 2023. Our provision for credit losses increased by 1.5 billion to 9.1 billion in the first nine months of 2024 primarily driven by higher net charge-offs in Domestic Card, partially offset by a lower net allowance build.

 Total liabilities increased by 3.1 billion to 423.5 billion as of September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023 primarily driven by deposit growth due to our national consumer banking strategy, partially offset by net maturities of our securitized debt obligations. Our national consumer banking strategy includes our national brand and marketing strategy, caf s, and tech / digital investments, which have enabled us to both deepen and grow our overall customer base. 
 Stockholders equity increased by 4.8 billion to 62.9 billion as of September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023 primarily driven by net income of 3.7 billion. 
 The following is a discussion of material changes in the major components of our assets and liabilities during the first nine months of 2024. Period-end balance sheet amounts may vary from average balance sheet amounts due to the timing of normal balance sheet management activities that are intended to support our capital and liquidity positions, our market risk profile and the needs of our customers.

We estimate our uninsured amounts based on methodologies and assumptions used for our Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council FFIEC 031) filed with the Federal Banking Agencies, adjusted to exclude certain items not presented within deposits on our consolidated balance sheet, including intercompany balances and cash collateral received on certain derivative contracts .

 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
 In the ordinary course of business, we engage in certain activities that are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets, generally referred to as off-balance sheet arrangements. These activities typically involve transactions with unconsolidated variable interest entities VIEs as well as other arrangements, such as letters of credit, loan commitments and guarantees, to meet the financing needs of our customers and support their ongoing operations. We provide additional information regarding these types of activities in Part I Item 1. Financial Statements Note 6 Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations and Part I Item 1.

 BUSINESS SEGMENT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 
 Our principal operations are organized for management reporting purposes into three major business segments, which are defined primarily based on the products and services provided or the types of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into or managed as a part of our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a business segment are included in the Other category, such as the management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability positions performed by our centralized Corporate Treasury group and any residual tax expense or benefit beyond what is assessed to our business segments in order to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate. The Other category also includes unallocated corporate expenses that do not directly support the operations of the business segments or for which the business segments are not considered financially accountable in evaluating their performance, such as certain restructuring charges and integration expenses related to the agreement to acquire Discover. 
 The results of our individual businesses, which we report on a continuing operations basis, reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources. We may periodically change our business segments or reclassify business segment results based on modifications to our management reporting methodologies and changes in organizational alignment. Our business segment results are intended to reflect each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. We use an internal management and reporting process to derive our business segment results. Our internal management and reporting process employs various allocation methodologies, including funds transfer pricing, to assign certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenues and expenses directly or indirectly attributable to each business segment. Total interest income and non-interest income are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported. The net interest income of each segment reflects the results of our funds transfer pricing process, which is primarily based on a matched funding concept that takes into consideration market interest rates. Our funds transfer pricing process is managed by our centralized Corporate Treasury group and provides a funds credit for sources of funds, such as deposits generated by our Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking businesses, and a charge for the use of funds by each segment. The allocation is unique to each business segment and acquired business and is based on the composition of assets and liabilities. The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet products. Periodically, the methodology and assumptions utilized in the funds transfer pricing process are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other factors, which may impact the allocation of net interest income to the business segments. We regularly assess the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, which may result in the implementation of refinements or changes in future periods. We provide additional information on the allocation methodologies used to derive our business segment results in Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 17 Business Segments and Revenue from Contracts with Customers in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 We refer to the business segment results derived from our internal management accounting and reporting process as our managed presentation, which differs in some cases from our reported results prepared based on U.S. GAAP. There is no comprehensive authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to U.S. GAAP; therefore, the managed presentation of our business segment results may not be comparable to similar information provided by other financial services companies. In addition, our individual business segment results should not be used as a substitute for comparable results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 We summarize our business segment results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 and 2023 and provide a comparative discussion of these results, as well as changes in our financial condition and credit performance metrics as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. We provide a reconciliation of our total business segment results to our reported consolidated results in Part I Item 1.

 Key factors affecting the results of our Credit Card business for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 include the following: 
 Net Interest Income: Net interest income increased by 629 million to 5.7 billion in the third quarter of 2024 and increased by 1.8 billion to 16.3 billion in the first nine months of 2024 primarily driven by higher average loan balances and margins, including the impacts of the elimination of revenue sharing provisions due to the Walmart Program Termination. 
 Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income remained substantially flat at 1.5 billion in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. Non-interest income increased by 116 million to 4.5 billion in the first nine months of 2024 due to growth in our Credit Card business. 
 Provision for Credit Losses: Provision for credit losses increased by 131 million to 2.1 billion in the third quarter of 2024 driven by higher net charge-offs, including the impacts of the elimination of loss sharing provisions due to the Walmart Program Termination, partially offset by an allowance release compared to an allowance build in the third quarter of 2023. Provision for credit losses increased by 1.6 billion to 7.9 billion in the first nine months of 2024 primarily driven by higher net charge-offs, partially offset by a lower allowance build. 
 
 Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense increased by 352 million to 3.4 billion in the third quarter of 2024 and increased by 657 million to 9.7 billion in the first nine months of 2024 primarily driven by growth in our Credit Card business and increased marketing spend. 
 Loans Held for Investment: 
 Period-end loans held for investment increased by 2.1 billion to 156.7 billion as of September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023 primarily driven by growth across our portfolio.

 (1) We recognize finance charges and fee income on open-ended loans in accordance with the contractual provisions of the credit arrangements and charge off any uncollectible amounts. Finance charges and fees charged off as uncollectible are reflected as a reduction in total net revenue. 
 (2) Average yield is calculated based on annualized interest income for the period divided by average loans during the period and does not include any allocations, such as funds transfer pricing. 
 (3) Total net revenue margin is calculated based on annualized total net revenue for the period divided by average loans during the period. 
 (4) The Walmart Program Termination increased revenue margin by 51 bps and 21 bps in the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 (5) The Walmart Program Termination increased the Domestic Card net charge-off rate by 38 bps and 19 bps in the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 (6) The Walmart Program Termination resulted in an allowance for credit losses build in Domestic Card of 826 million in the second quarter of 2024. 
 Because our Domestic Card business accounts for the substantial majority of our Credit Card business, the key factors driving the results are similar to the key factors affecting our total Credit Card business. Net income for our Domestic Card business increased in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily driven by:

 Key factors affecting the results of our Consumer Banking business for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 include the following: 
 Net Interest Income: Net interest income decreased by 105 million to 2.0 billion in the third quarter of 2024 and decreased by 698 million to 6.1 billion in the first nine months of 2024 primarily driven by lower margins in our retail banking business, partially offset by higher deposits in our retail banking business. 
 Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income increased by 40 million to 182 million in the third quarter of 2024 and increased by 87 million to 513 million in the first nine months of 2024 primarily driven by higher interchange revenue from an increase in debit card purchase volume and revenue earned from auto industry services. 
 Provision for Credit Losses: Provision for credit losses increased by 138 million to 351 million in the third quarter of 2024 and increased by 360 million to 1.1 billion in the first nine months of 2024 primarily driven by higher net charge-offs and a smaller allowance release in our auto loan portfolio. 
 Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense remained substantially flat at 1.3 billion in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 and 3.8 billion in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023.

 Key factors affecting the results of our Commercial Banking business for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 include the following: 
 Net Interest Income: Net interest income decreased by 25 million to 596 million in the third quarter of 2024 and decreased by 97 million to 1.8 billion in the first nine months of 2024 primarily driven by lower average loan balances. 
 Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income remained substantially flat at 292 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. Non-interest income increased by 87 million to 844 million in the first nine months of 2024 primarily driven by our capital markets business. 
 Provision for Credit Losses: Provision for credit losses decreased by 68 million to 48 million in the third quarter of 2024 primarily driven by an allowance release compared to an allowance build in the third quarter of 2023. Provision for credit losses decreased by 441 million to 80 million in the first nine months of 2024 primarily driven by lower net charge-offs in our office real estate portfolio. 
 Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense remained substantially flat at 495 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 and at 1.5 billion in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023. 
 Loans Held for Investment: 
 Period-end loans held for investment decreased by 3.7 billion to 86.8 billion as of September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023 primarily driven by customer payments outpacing originations. 
 Average loans held for investment decreased by 3.5 billion to 88.1 billion in the third quarter of 2024 and decreased by 3.9 billion to 89.0 billion in the first nine months of 2024 primarily driven by customer payments outpacing originations. 
 Deposits: 
 Period-end deposits decreased by 2.1 billion to 30.6 billion as of September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023 primarily driven by an intentional reduction in lower margin deposit balances. 
 Net Charge-Off and Nonperforming Metrics: 
 The net charge-off rate remained substantially flat at 0.22 in the third quarter of 2024. The net charge-off rate decreased by 49 bps to 0.17 in the first nine months of 2024 primarily driven by lower net charge-offs in our office real estate portfolio. 
 The nonperforming loan rate increased by 71 bps to 1.55 as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 primarily driven by credit downgrades. 
 
 Other Category 
 Other includes unallocated amounts related to our centralized Corporate Treasury group activities, such as management of our corporate investment securities portfolio, asset/liability management and oversight of our funds transfer pricing process. Other also includes: 
 unallocated corporate revenue and expenses that do not directly support the operations of the business segments or for which the business segments are not considered financially accountable in evaluating their performance, such as certain restructuring charges and integration expenses related to the agreement to acquire Discover; 
 offsets related to certain line-item reclassifications; 
 residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate that is not assessed to our primary business segments; and 
 foreign exchange-rate fluctuations on foreign currency-denominated balances.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make a number of judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses on the consolidated financial statements. Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We provide a summary of our significant accounting policies under Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 We have identified the following accounting estimates as critical because they require significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Our critical accounting policies and estimates are as follows: 
 Loan loss reserves 
 Goodwill 
 Fair value 
 Customer rewards reserve 
 We evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and update them as necessary, based on changing conditions. There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates described in our 2023 Form 10-K under Part II Item 7. MD A Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.

 CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 
 The level and composition of our capital are determined by multiple factors, including our consolidated regulatory capital requirements as described in more detail below and internal risk-based capital assessments such as internal stress testing. The level and composition of our capital may also be influenced by rating agency guidelines, subsidiary capital requirements, business environment, conditions in the financial markets and assessments of potential future losses due to adverse changes in our business and market environments. 
 
 Capital Standards and Prompt Corrective Action 
 The Company and the Bank are subject to the regulatory capital requirements established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency OCC ), respectively (the Basel III Capital Rules ). The Basel III Capital Rules implement certain capital requirements published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision Basel Committee ), along with certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 Dodd-Frank Act and other capital provisions. 
 As a bank holding company BHC with total consolidated assets of at least 250 billion but less than 700 billion and not exceeding any of the applicable risk-based thresholds, the Company is a Category III institution under the Basel III Capital Rules. 
 The Bank, as a subsidiary of a Category III institution, is a Category III bank. Moreover, the Bank, as an insured depository institution, is subject to prompt corrective action PCA capital regulations. 
 Basel III and U.S. Capital Rules 
 Under the Basel III Capital Rules, we must maintain a minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5 , a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0 and a total capital ratio of 8.0 , in each case in relation to risk-weighted assets. In addition, we must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0 and a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3.0 . We are also subject to the capital conservation buffer requirement and countercyclical capital buffer requirement, each as described below. Our capital and leverage ratios are calculated based on the Basel III standardized approach framework. 
 We have elected to exclude certain elements of accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI from our regulatory capital as permitted for a Category III institution. For information on the recognition of AOCI in regulatory capital under the proposed changes to the Basel III Capital Rules, see Part I Item 1. Business Supervision and Regulation Prudential Regulation of Banking Capital and Stress Testing Regulation Basel III Finalization Proposal in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Global systemically important banks G-SIBs that are based in the U.S. are subject to an additional CET1 capital requirement known as the G-SIB Surcharge. We are not a G-SIB based on the most recent available data and thus we are not subject to a G-SIB Surcharge. 
 Stress Capital Buffer Rule 
 The Basel III Capital Rules require banking institutions to maintain a capital conservation buffer, composed of CET1 capital, above the regulatory minimum ratios. Under the Federal Reserve s final rule to implement the stress capital buffer requirement Stress Capital Buffer Rule ), the Company s standardized approach capital conservation buffer includes its stress capital buffer requirement (as described below), any G-SIB Surcharge (which is not applicable to us) and the countercyclical capital buffer requirement (which is currently set at 0 ). Any determination to increase the countercyclical capital buffer generally would be effective twelve months after the announcement of such an increase, unless the Federal Reserve, OCC and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC ), hereafter collectively referred to as the Federal Banking Agencies, set an earlier effective date. 
 The Company s stress capital buffer requirement is recalibrated every year based on the Company s supervisory stress test results. In particular, the Company s stress capital buffer requirement equals, subject to a floor of 2.5 , the sum of (i) the difference between the Company s starting CET1 capital ratio and its lowest projected CET1 capital ratio under the severely adverse scenario of the Federal Reserve s supervisory stress test plus (ii) the ratio of the Company s projected four quarters of common stock dividends (for the fourth to seventh quarters of the planning horizon) to the projected risk-weighted assets for the quarter in which the Company s projected CET1 capital ratio reaches its minimum under the supervisory stress test. 
 34 
 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

Table of Contents 

 Based on the Company s 2023 supervisory stress test results, the Company s stress capital buffer requirement for the period beginning on October 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024 was 4.8 . Therefore, the Company s minimum capital requirements plus the standardized approach capital conservation buffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios under the stress capital buffer framework were 9.3 , 10.8 and 12.8 , respectively, for the period from October 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024. 
 Based on the Company s 2024 supervisory stress test results, the Company s stress capital buffer requirement for the period beginning on October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025 is 5.5 . Therefore, the Company s minimum capital requirements plus the standardized approach capital conservation buffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios under the stress capital buffer framework are 10.0 , 11.5 and 13.5 , respectively, for the period from October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025. 
 The Stress Capital Buffer Rule does not apply to the Bank. Pursuant to the OCC s capital regulations, which are only applicable to the Bank, the capital conservation buffer for the Bank continues to be fixed at 2.5 . Accordingly, the Bank s minimum capital requirements plus its capital conservation buffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios are 7.0 , 8.5 and 10.5 , respectively. 
 If the Company or the Bank fails to maintain its capital ratios above the minimum capital requirements plus the applicable capital conservation buffer requirements, it will face increasingly strict automatic limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to certain executive officers. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, the Company and the Bank each exceeded the minimum capital requirements and the capital conservation buffer requirements applicable to them, and the Company and the Bank were each well-capitalized. The well-capitalized standards applicable to the Company are established in the Federal Reserve s regulations, and the well-capitalized standards applicable to the Bank are established in the OCC s PCA capital requirements. 
 CECL Transition Rule 
 The Federal Banking Agencies adopted a final rule (the CECL Transition Rule that provides banking institutions an optional five-year transition period to phase in the impact of the current expected credit losses CECL standard on their regulatory capital CECL Transition Election ). We adopted the CECL standard (for accounting purposes) as of January 1, 2020, and made the CECL Transition Election (for regulatory capital purposes) in the first quarter of 2020. Therefore, the applicable amounts presented in this Report reflect such election. 
 Pursuant to the CECL Transition Rule, a banking institution could elect to delay the estimated impact of adopting CECL on its regulatory capital through December 31, 2021 and then phase in the estimated cumulative impact from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. For the day 2 ongoing impact of CECL during the initial two years, the Federal Banking Agencies used a uniform scaling factor of 25 as an approximation of the increase in the allowance under the CECL standard compared to the prior incurred loss methodology. Accordingly, from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021, electing banking institutions were permitted to add back to their regulatory capital an amount equal to the sum of the after-tax day 1 CECL adoption impact and 25 of the increase in the allowance since the adoption of the CECL standard. From January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024, the after-tax day 1 CECL adoption impact and the cumulative day 2 ongoing impact are being phased in to regulatory capital at 25 per year. The following table summarizes the capital impact delay and phase in period on our regulatory capital from years 2020 to 2025. 
 Capital Impact Delayed Phase In Period 
 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 Day 1 CECL adoption impact Capital impact delayed to 2022 25 Phased In 50 Phased In 75 Phased In Fully Phased In Cumulative day 2 ongoing impact 25 scaling factor as an approximation of the increase in allowance under CECL 
 As of December 31, 2021, we added back an aggregate amount of 2.4 billion to our regulatory capital pursuant to the CECL Transition Rule. Consistent with the rule, we have phased in 75 of this amount as of January 1, 2024. The remaining 600 million will be phased in on January 1, 2025. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s CET1 capital ratio, reflecting the 
 35 
 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

Table of Contents 

 CECL Transition Rule, was 13.6 and would have been 13.4 excluding the impact of the CECL Transition Rule (or on a fully phased-in basis ). 
 Market Risk Rule 
 The Market Risk Rule supplements the Basel III Capital Rules by requiring institutions subject to the rule to adjust their risk-based capital ratios to reflect the market risk in their trading book. The Market Risk Rule generally applies to institutions with aggregate trading assets and liabilities equal to 10 or more of total assets or 1 billion or more. As of September 30, 2024, the Company and the Bank are subject to the Market Risk Rule. See Market Risk Profile below for additional information. 
 For the description of the regulatory capital rules to which we are subject, including recent proposed amendments to these rules under the Basel III Finalization Proposal, see Part I Item 1. Business Supervision and Regulation in our 2023 Form 10-K.

 Capital Planning and Regulatory Stress Testing 
 We repurchased 150 million of shares of our common stock during the third quarter of 2024 and 403 million of shares of our common stock during the first nine months of 2024. 
 On August 28, 2024, the Federal Reserve confirmed and announced individual stress capital buffer requirements for all large banking institutions, including the Company. The Company s final stress capital buffer requirement for the period beginning on October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025 is 5.5 . Therefore, the Company s minimum capital requirements plus the standardized approach capital conservation buffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios under the stress capital buffer framework are 10.0 , 11.5 and 13.5 , respectively, for the period from October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025. 
 For the description of the regulatory capital planning rules and stress testing requirements to which we are subject, see Part I Item 1. Business Supervision and Regulation in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 The Federal Reserve s capital plan rule provides that if a BHC determines there has been or will be a material change in its risk profile, financial condition, or corporate structure since it last submitted the capital plan, it must update and resubmit its capital plan within 30 calendar days, subject to a potential 60-day extension . We determined that our proposed acquisition of Discover constitutes a material change and submitted an updated capital plan as required by the capital plan rule. The capital plan rule further provides that upon the occurrence of an event requiring resubmission, a BHC may not make any capital distribution unless it has received approval of the Federal Reserve. Accordingly, all our capital distributions are now subject to the prior approval of the Federal Reserve pending the Federal Reserve s consideration of our resubmitted capital plan. We have received prior approval of the Federal Reserve to make certain capital distributions.

 The declaration and payment of dividends to our stockholders, as well as the amount thereof, are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, capital levels, cash requirements, future prospects, regulatory requirements and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors. For additional information related to capital distributions as a result of the capital plan resubmission, see Capital Management Capital Planning and Regulatory Stress Testing in this Report. 
 As a BHC, our ability to pay dividends is largely dependent upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries. The Bank is subject to regulatory restrictions that limit its ability to transfer funds to our BHC. As of September 30, 2024, funds available for dividend payments from the Bank were 9.2 billion. There can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends to stockholders. We repurchased 150 million of shares of our common stock during the third quarter of 2024 and 403 million of shares of our common stock during the first nine months of 2024. The timing and exact amount of any future common stock repurchases will depend on various factors, including regulatory approval, market conditions, opportunities for growth, our capital position and the amount of retained earnings. The Board authorized stock repurchase program does not include specific price targets, may be executed through open market purchases, tender offers, or privately negotiated transactions, including utilizing Rule 10b5-1 programs, does not have a set expiration date and may be suspended at any time.

 Credit Risk Measurement 
 We closely monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to assess and manage our exposure to credit risk. Trends in delinquency rates are the key credit quality indicator for our credit card and retail banking loan portfolios as changes in delinquency rates can provide an early warning of changes in potential future credit losses. The key indicator we monitor when assessing the credit quality and risk of our auto loan portfolio is borrower credit scores as they provide insight into borrower risk profiles, which give indications of potential future credit losses. The key credit quality indicator for our commercial loan portfolios is our internal risk ratings as we generally classify loans that have been delinquent for an extended period of time and other loans with significant risk of loss as nonperforming. In addition to these credit quality indicators, we also manage and monitor other credit quality metrics such as level of nonperforming loans and net charge-off rates. 
 We underwrite most consumer loans using proprietary models, which typically include credit bureau data, such as borrower credit scores, application information and, where applicable, collateral and deal structure data. We continuously adjust our management of credit lines and collection strategies based on customer behavior and risk profile changes. We also use borrower credit scores for subprime classification, for competitive benchmarking and, in some cases, to drive product segmentation decisions. 
 Table 21 provides details on the credit scores of our domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 (1) Percentages represent period-end loans held for investment in each credit score category. Domestic Card credit scores generally represent Fair Isaac Corporation FICO scores. These scores are obtained from one of the major credit bureaus at origination and are refreshed monthly thereafter. We approximate non-FICO credit scores to comparable FICO scores for consistency purposes. Balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 660 or below category. 
 (2) Percentages represent period-end loans held for investment in each credit score category. Auto credit scores generally represent average FICO scores obtained from three credit bureaus at the time of application and are not refreshed thereafter. Balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 620 or below category. 
 In our commercial loan portfolio, we assign internal risk ratings to loans based on relevant information about the ability of the borrowers to repay their debt. In determining the risk rating of a particular loan, some of the factors considered are the borrower s current financial condition, historical and projected future credit performance, prospects for support from financially responsible guarantors, the estimated realizable value of any collateral and current economic trends. 
 We present information in the section below on the credit performance of our loan portfolio, including the key metrics we use in tracking changes in the credit quality of our loan portfolio. See Part I Item 1. Financial Statements Note 4 Loans for additional credit quality information and see Part II Item 8.

 Delinquency Rates 
 We consider the entire balance of an account to be delinquent if the minimum required payment is not received by the customer s due date, measured at each balance sheet date. Our 30+ day delinquency metrics include all loans held for investment that are 30 or more days past due, whereas our 30+ day performing delinquency metrics include all loans held for investment that are 30 or more days past due but are currently classified as performing and accruing interest. The 30+ day delinquency and 30+ day performing delinquency metrics are the same for domestic credit card loans, as we continue to classify these loans as performing until the account is charged off, typically when the account is 180 days past due. See Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our 2023 Form 10-K for information on our policies for classifying loans as nonperforming for each of our loan categories.

 Net Charge-Offs 
 Net charge-offs consist of the amortized cost basis, excluding accrued interest, of loans held for investment that we determine to be uncollectible, net of recovered amounts. We charge off loans as a reduction to the allowance for credit losses when we determine the loan is uncollectible and record subsequent recoveries of previously charged off amounts as increases to the allowance for credit losses. Uncollectible finance charges and fees are reversed through revenue and certain fraud losses are recorded in other non-interest expense. Generally, costs to recover charged off loans are recorded as collection expenses as incurred and are included in our consolidated statements of income as a component of other non-interest expense. Our charge-off policy for loans varies based on the loan type. See Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our 2023 Form 10-K for information on our charge-off policy for each of our loan categories.

 Financial Difficulty Modifications to Borrowers 
 A financial difficulty modification FDM occurs when a modification in the form of principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, an other-than-insignificant payment delay, a term extension or a combination of these modifications is granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. 
 As part of our loss mitigation efforts, we may provide short-term (one to twelve months) or long-term (greater than twelve months) modifications to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty to improve long-term collectability of the loan and to avoid the need for repossession or foreclosure of collateral. 
 We consider the impact of all loan modifications, including FDMs, when estimating the credit quality of our loan portfolio and establishing allowance levels. For our Commercial Banking customers, loan modifications are also considered in the assignment of an internal risk rating. 
 In our Credit Card business, the majority of our FDMs receive an interest rate reduction and are placed on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months. If the customer does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan agreement may revert to its original payment terms, generally resulting in any loan outstanding being reflected in the appropriate delinquency category and charged off in accordance with our standard charge-off policy. 
 In our Consumer Banking business, the majority of our FDMs receive an extension, an interest rate reduction, principal reduction, or a combination of these modifications. 
 In our Commercial Banking business, the majority of our FDMs receive an extension. A portion of FDMs receive an interest rate reduction, principal reduction, or a combination of modifications. 
 For more information on FDMs, see Item 1. Financial Statements Note 4 Loans. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments 
 Our allowance for credit losses represents management s current estimate of expected credit losses over the contractual terms of our loans held for investment as of each balance sheet date. Expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off or expected to be charged off are recognized within the allowance. We also estimate expected credit losses related to unfunded lending commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable. The provision for losses on unfunded lending commitments is included in the provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of income and the related reserve for unfunded lending commitments is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We provide additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used in determining our allowance for credit losses in Part II Item 8.Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our 2023 Form 10-K.

 LIQUIDITY RISK PROFILE 
 We manage our funding and liquidity risk in an integrated manner in support of the current and future cash flow needs of our business. We maintained liquidity reserves of 131.6 billion and 120.7 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, as shown in Table 28 below. Included in liquidity reserves are cash and cash equivalents, investment securities and FHLB borrowing capacity secured by loans. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had available issuance capacity of 41.0 billion under shelf registrations associated with our credit card and auto loan securitization programs. We also maintain a shelf registration that enables us to issue an indeterminate amount of senior or subordinated debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock, purchase contracts, warrants and units. Our ability to issue under each shelf registration is subject to market conditions. 
 Finally, as of September 30, 2024, we had access to available contingent liquidity sources totaling 105.8 billion through the prepositioning of collateral, including a portion of the investment securities included in the liquidity reserve amount, at the Federal Reserve Discount Window, the Standing Repo Facility, FHLB and the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation Government Securities Division FICC GSD ). 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our funding sources totaled 403.0 billion and 398.3 billion, respectively, primarily composed of consumer deposits , as shown in Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis Funding Sources Composition. 
 Our liquidity reserves, borrowing capacity, contingent liquidity sources and total funding sources are all discussed in more detail in the following sections. 
 
 Table 28 below presents the composition of our liquidity reserves as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 (1) Includes securities that have been pledged or otherwise encumbered within the above Liquidity Reserves line items Outstanding FHLB advances and letters of credit secured by loans and investment securities and Other encumbrances of investment securities . 
 Our liquidity reserves increased by 11.0 billion to 131.6 billion as of September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023, primarily due to increases in cash and cash equivalents. In addition to these liquidity reserves, we maintain access to a diversified mix of funding sources as discussed in the Borrowing Capacity and Funding sections below. See Part II Item 7. MD A Risk Management in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information on our management of liquidity risk. 
 Liquidity Coverage Ratio 
 We are subject to the final rules published by the Basel Committee and as implemented by the Federal Reserve and the OCC for the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio LCR in the United States (the LCR Rule ). The LCR Rule requires each of the Company and the Bank to calculate its respective LCR daily. It also requires the Company to publicly disclose, on a quarterly basis, its LCR, certain related quantitative liquidity metrics, and a qualitative discussion of its LCR. Our average LCR during the third quarter of 2024 was 163 , which exceeded the LCR Rule requirement of 100 . The calculation and the underlying components are based on our interpretations, expectations and assumptions of relevant regulations, as well as interpretations provided by our regulators, and are subject to change based on changes to future regulations and interpretations. See Part I Item 1. Business Supervision and Regulation in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information.

 Net Stable Funding Ratio 
 We are subject to the final rules published by the Basel Committee and as implemented by the Federal Reserve and the OCC for the Basel III Net Stable Funding Ratio NSFR in the United States (the NSFR Rule ). The NSFR Rule requires each of the Company and the Bank to maintain an NSFR of 100 on an ongoing basis. It also requires the Company to publicly disclose, on a semi-annual basis each second and fourth quarter, its NSFR, certain related quantitative liquidity metrics and qualitative discussion of its NSFR. Our average NSFR for the third quarter of 2024 exceeded the NSFR Rule requirement of 100 . The calculation and the underlying components are based on our interpretations, expectations and assumptions of the relevant regulations, as well as interpretations provided by our regulators, and are subject to change based on changes to future regulations and interpretations. See Part I Item 1. Business Supervision and Regulation in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information. 
 
 Borrowing Capacity 
 We maintain a shelf registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC so that we may periodically offer and sell an indeterminate aggregate amount of senior or subordinated debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock, purchase contracts, warrants and units. There is no limit under this shelf registration to the amount or number of such securities that we may offer and sell, subject to market conditions. In addition, we also maintain a shelf registration associated with our credit card securitization trust that allows us to periodically offer and sell up to 30.0 billion of securitized debt obligations and a shelf registration associated with our auto loan securitization trusts that allows us to periodically offer and sell up to 25.0 billion of securitized debt obligations. The registered amounts under these shelf registration statements are subject to continuing review and change in the future, including as part of the routine renewal process. As of September 30, 2024, we had 21.6 billion and 19.4 billion of available issuance capacity in our credit card and auto loan securitization programs, respectively. 
 In addition to our issuance capacity under the shelf registration statements, we also have collateral pledged to support our access to FHLB advances, the Federal Reserve Discount Window, the Standing Repo Facility and FICC GSD general collateral financing repurchase agreement service. For each of these programs, the ability to borrow utilizing these sources is dependent on meeting the respective membership requirements. Our borrowing capacity in each program is a function of the collateral the Bank has posted with each counterparty, including any respective haircuts applied to that collateral. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we pledged loans and securities to the FHLB to secure a maximum borrowing capacity of 37.0 billion , of which 48 million was used. Our FHLB membership is supported by our investment in FHLB stock of 18 million as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 As a member of FICC GSD, we had 21.9 billion of readily available borrowing capacity secured by securities from our investment portfolio as of September 30, 2024. Our FICC GSD membership is supported by our investment in Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation DTCC common stock of 412 thousand and 375 thousand as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we pledged loans to secure a borrowing capacity of 46.9 billion under the Federal Reserve Discount Window. Our membership with the Federal Reserve is supported by our investment in Federal Reserve stock, which totaled 1.3 billion as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 The FDIC limits the acceptance of brokered deposits to well-capitalized insured depository institutions and, with a waiver from the FDIC, to adequately-capitalized institutions. The Bank was well-capitalized, as defined under the federal banking regulatory guidelines, as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. See Part I Item 1. Business Supervision and Regulation in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information. We provide additional information on the composition of deposits in Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis Funding Sources Composition and in Part I Item 1. Financial Statements Note 8 Deposits and Borrowings. 
 
 Funding 
 Our primary source of funding comes from insured retail deposits, as they are a relatively stable and lower cost source of funding. In addition to deposits, we raise funding through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes and securitized debt obligations, federal funds purchased, securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase and FHLB advances secured by certain portions of our loan and securities portfolios. A key objective in our use of these markets is to maintain access to a diversified mix of wholesale funding sources. See Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis Funding Sources Composition for additional information on our primary sources of funding. 
 In the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments that affect our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. Our future cash outflows primarily relate to deposits, borrowings and operating leases. The actual timing and amounts of future cash payments may vary over time due to a number of factors, such as early debt redemptions and changes in deposit balances.

 Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt 
 We access the capital markets to meet our funding needs through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, securitized debt obligations and federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. In addition, we have access to short-term and long-term FHLB advances secured by certain investment securities, multifamily real estate loans and commercial real estate loans. 
 Our short-term borrowings, which include those borrowings with an original contractual maturity of one year or less, typically consist of federal funds purchased, securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase or short-term FHLB advances, and do not include the current portion of long-term debt. Our short-term borrowings decreased by 18 million to 520 million as of September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023 driven by a decrease in repurchase agreements. 
 Our long-term funding, which primarily consists of securitized debt obligations and senior and subordinated notes, decreased by 502 million to 48.8 billion as of September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023 primarily driven by net maturities and paydowns of securitized debt obligations, partially offset by net issuances of unsecured senior debt. We provide more information on our securitization activity in Part I Item 1. Financial Statements Note 6 Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations and on our borrowings in Part I Item 1. Financial Statements Note 8 Deposits and Borrowings.

 As of October 25, 2024 Standard Poor s S P and Fitch Ratings Fitch have our credit ratings on a stable outlook. Following the Company s February 19, 2024 announcement to acquire Discover, Moody s Investors Service Moody s placed our credit ratings on review for a downgrade. Moody s said its review for downgrade may continue until the transaction has been completed. 
 
 Other Commitments 
 In the normal course of business, we enter into other contractual obligations that may require future cash payments that affect our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. Our other contractual obligations include lending commitments, leases, purchase obligations and other contractual arrangements. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our total unfunded lending commitments were 458.9 billion and 441.3 billion, respectively, primarily consisting of credit card lines and loan commitments to customers of both our Commercial Banking and Consumer Banking businesses, as well as standby and commercial letters of credit. We generally manage the potential risk of unfunded lending commitments by limiting the total amount of arrangements, monitoring the size and maturity structure of these portfolios and applying the same credit standards for all of our credit activities. For additional information, refer to Part I Item 1. Financial Statements Note 14 Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others in this Report. 
 Our primary involvement with leases is in the capacity as a lessee where we lease premises to support our business. The majority of our leases are operating leases of office space, retail bank branches and caf s. Our operating leases expire at various dates through 2071, although some have extension or termination options. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 1.5 billion, in aggregate operating lease obligations. We provide more information on our lease activity in Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 7 Premises, Equipment and Leases in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 We have purchase obligations that represent substantial agreements to purchase goods or receive services such as data management, media and other software and third-party services that are enforceable and legally binding and specify significant terms. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 3.8 billion and 789 million, respectively, in aggregate purchase obligations. This increase is mainly due to recently renewed commitments for certain long term purchase obligations for goods and services. 
 We also enter into various contractual arrangements that may require future cash payments, including short-term obligations such as trade payables, commitments to fund certain equity investments, obligations for pension and post-retirement benefit plans, and representation and warranty reserves. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Part I Item 1. Financial Statements Note 6 Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations, and Part I Item 1.

 MARKET RISK PROFILE 
 Our primary market risk exposures include interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and commodity pricing risk. We are exposed to market risk primarily from the following operations and activities: 
 Traditional banking activities of deposit gathering and lending; 
 Asset/liability management activities including the management of investment securities, short-term and long-term borrowings and derivatives; 
 Foreign operations in the U.K. and Canada within our Credit Card business; and 
 Customer accommodation activities within our Commercial Banking business. 
 We have enterprise-wide risk management policies and limits, approved by our Board of Directors, which govern our market risk management activities. Our objective is to manage our exposure to market risk in accordance with these policies and limits based on prevailing market conditions and long-term expectations. We provide additional information below about our primary sources of market risk, our market risk management strategies and the measures that we use to evaluate these exposures. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate risk represents exposure to financial instruments whose values vary with the level or volatility of interest rates. We are exposed to interest rate risk primarily from the differences in the timing between the maturities or repricing of assets and liabilities. We manage our interest rate risk primarily by entering into interest rate swaps and other derivative instruments which could include caps, floors, options, futures and forward contracts. 
 We use various industry standard market risk measurement techniques and analyses to measure, assess and manage the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and our economic value of equity and changes in foreign exchange rates on our non-dollar-denominated funding and non-dollar equity investments in foreign operations. 
 Net Interest Income Sensitivity 
 Our net interest income sensitivity measure estimates the impact of hypothetical instantaneous movements in interest rates relative to our baseline interest rate forecast on our projected 12-month net interest income. Net interest income sensitivity metrics are derived using the following key assumptions: 
 As of September 30, 2024, our metrics assume a market implied baseline interest rate projection for the upper limit of the Federal Funds Target Rate of 4.25 and 3.00 at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2025, respectively. 
 In addition to our existing assets, liabilities and derivative positions, we incorporate expected future business growth assumptions. These assumptions include loan and deposit growth, pricing, plans for projected changes in our funding mix and our securities and cash position from our internal corporate outlook that is used in our financial planning process. 
 The analysis assumes this forecast of expected future business growth remains unchanged between the baseline rate forecast and rate shock scenarios, including no changes to our interest rate risk management activities like securities and hedging actions. 
 We incorporate the dynamic nature of deposit re-pricing, which includes pricing lags and changes in deposit beta and mix as interest rates change, and the prepayment sensitivity of our mortgage securities to the level of interest rates. In our models, deposit betas and mortgage security prepayments vary dynamically based on the level of interest rates and by product type. In the contexts used in this section, beta refers to the change in deposit rate paid relative to the change in the federal funds rate. 
 In instances where an interest rate scenario would result in a rate less than 0 , we assume a rate of 0 for that scenario. This assumption applies only to jurisdictions that do not have a practice of employing negative policy rates. In jurisdictions that have negative policy rates, we do not floor interest rates at 0 . 
 60 
 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

Table of Contents 

 At the current level of interest rates, our projected 12-month net interest income is expected to increase in higher rate scenarios and decrease in lower rate scenarios. The decrease in lower rate scenarios is driven by lower interest income from our assets, including floating rate credit card and commercial loans, being partially offset by lower interest expense from our deposits and other liabilities, net of our interest rate hedges. Our 12-month net interest income sensitivity increased modestly for the +/- 200 bps scenarios, while the remaining scenarios were largely unchanged as compared to December 31, 2023. Increased net interest income sensitivity to large rate shocks is mainly driven by lower interest rates. 
 Economic Value of Equity Sensitivity 
 Our economic value of equity sensitivity measure estimates the impact of hypothetical instantaneous movements in interest rates on the net present value of our assets and liabilities, including derivative exposures. Economic value of equity sensitivity metrics are derived using the following key assumptions: 
 As of September 30, 2024, our metrics assume a market implied baseline interest rate projection for the upper limit of the Federal Funds Target Rate of 4.25 and 3.00 at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2025, respectively. 
 The analysis includes only existing assets, liabilities and derivative positions and does not incorporate business growth assumptions or projected balance sheet changes. 
 Similar to our net interest income sensitivity measure, we incorporate the dynamic nature of deposit repricing and attrition, which includes pricing lags and changes in deposit beta as interest rates change and the prepayment sensitivity of our mortgage securities to the level of interest rates. In our models, deposit betas and mortgage security prepayments vary dynamically based on the level of interest rates and by product type. 
 Balance attrition assumptions for loans, including credit card, auto and commercial loans, remain unchanged between the baseline interest rate forecast and interest rate shock scenarios as those loans are mainly floating rate or shorter duration fixed rate loans and hence paydowns have a low sensitivity to the level of interest rates. 
 For assets and liabilities with embedded optionality, such as mortgage securities and deposit balances, we utilize monte carlo simulations to assess economic value with industry-standard term structure modeling of interest rates. 
 Our calculations of net present value apply appropriate spreads over the benchmark yield curve for select assets and liabilities to capture the inherent risks (including credit risk) to discount expected interest and principal cash flows. 
 In instances where an interest rate scenario would result in a rate less than 0 , we assume a rate of 0 for that scenario. This assumption applies only to jurisdictions that do not have a practice of employing negative policy rates. In jurisdictions that have negative policy rates, we do not floor interest rates at 0 . 
 Our current economic value of equity sensitivity profile demonstrates that our economic value of equity decreases in higher interest rate scenarios and increases in lower interest rate scenarios. The decrease in higher rate scenarios is due to the declines in the projected value of our fixed rate assets being only partially offset by corresponding movements in the projected value of our deposits and other liabilities. The pace of economic value of equity decrease is larger for the +200 bps scenario as our deposits are assumed to reprice more rapidly in higher interest rate environments. Our current economic value of equity sensitivity decreased modestly in both higher and lower rate scenarios as compared to December 31, 2023. The decrease in economic value of equity sensitivity is driven by lower interest rates.

 Table 32 shows the estimated percentage impact on our projected baseline net interest income and our current economic value of equity calculated under the methodology described above as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Table 32: Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Estimated impact on projected baseline net interest income: +200 basis points 1.2 0.7 +100 basis points 0.9 0.8 +50 basis points 0.5 0.4 50 basis points (0.5) (0.5) 100 basis points (1.0) (0.9) 200 basis points (2.6) (2.0) Estimated impact on economic value of equity: +200 basis points (7.0) (8.4) +100 basis points (3.0) (3.7) +50 basis points (1.5) (1.8) 50 basis points 1.2 1.6 100 basis points 2.2 2.9 200 basis points 2.4 4.0 
 In addition to these industry standard measures, we also consider the potential impact of alternative interest rate scenarios, such as larger rate shocks, higher than +/- 200 bps, as well as steepening and flattening yield curve scenarios in our internal interest rate risk management decisions. We also regularly review the sensitivity of our interest rate risk metrics to changes in our key modeling assumptions, such as our loan and deposit balance forecasts, mortgage prepayments and deposit repricing. 
 Limitations of Market Risk Measures 
 The interest rate risk models that we use in deriving these measures incorporate contractual information, internally-developed assumptions and proprietary modeling methodologies, which project borrower and depositor behavior patterns in certain interest rate environments. Other market inputs, such as interest rates, market prices and interest rate volatility, are also critical components of our interest rate risk measures. We regularly evaluate, update and enhance these assumptions, models and analytical tools as we believe appropriate to reflect our best assessment of the market environment and the expected behavior patterns of our existing assets and liabilities. 
 There are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates. The sensitivity analysis described above contemplates only certain movements in interest rates and is performed at a particular point in time based on our existing balance sheet and, in some cases, expected future business growth and funding mix assumptions. The strategic actions that management may take to manage our balance sheet may differ significantly from our projections, which could cause our actual earnings and economic value of equity sensitivities to differ substantially from the above sensitivity analysis.

 Foreign Exchange Risk 
 Foreign exchange risk represents exposure to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in other currencies. We are exposed to foreign exchange risk primarily from the intercompany funding denominated in pound sterling GBP and the Canadian dollar CAD that we provide to our businesses in the U.K. and Canada and net equity investments in those businesses. We are also exposed to foreign exchange risk due to changes in the dollar-denominated value of future earnings and cash flows from our foreign operations and from our Euro EUR )-denominated borrowings. 
 Our non-dollar denominated intercompany funding and EUR-denominated borrowings expose our earnings to foreign exchange transaction risk. We manage these transaction risks by using forward foreign currency derivatives and cross-currency swaps to hedge our exposures. We measure our foreign exchange transaction risk exposures by applying a 1 U.S. dollar appreciation shock against the value of the non-dollar denominated intercompany funding and EUR-denominated borrowings and their related hedges, which shows the impact to our earnings from foreign exchange risk. Our nominal intercompany funding outstanding was 1.2 billion GBP and 973 million GBP as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and 1.4 billion CAD and 1.6 billion CAD as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Our nominal EUR-denominated borrowings outstanding were 502 million EUR and 1.3 billion EUR as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Our non-dollar equity investments in foreign operations expose our balance sheet and capital ratios to translation risk in AOCI. We manage our translation risk by entering into foreign currency derivatives designated as net investment hedges. We measure these exposures by applying a 30 U.S. dollar appreciation shock, which we believe approximates a significant adverse shock over a one-year time horizon, against the value of the equity invested in our foreign operations net of related net investment hedges where applicable. Our gross equity exposures in our U.K. and Canadian operations were 2.2 billion GBP as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and 2.5 billion CAD and 2.4 billion CAD as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 As a result of our derivative management activities, we believe our net exposure to foreign exchange risk is minimal. For m ore information, see Part I Item 1. Financial Statements Note 9 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities and Part I Item 1. Financial Statements Note 10 Stockholders Equity. 
 Risk related to Customer Accommodation Derivatives 
 We offer interest rate, commodity and foreign currency derivatives as an accommodation to our customers within our Commercial Banking business. We offset the majority of the market risk of these customer accommodation derivatives by entering into offsetting derivatives transactions with other counterparties. We use value-at-risk VaR as the primary method to measure the market risk in our customer accommodation derivative activities on a daily basis. VaR is a statistical risk measure used to estimate the potential loss from movements observed in the recent market environment. We employ a historical simulation approach using the most recent 500 business days and use a 99 confidence level and a holding period of one business day. As a result of offsetting our customer exposures with other counterparties, we believe that our net exposure to market risk in our customer accommodation derivatives is minimal. For further information on our risk related to customer accommodation derivatives, see Part I Item 1. Financial Statements Note 9 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.

 (1) Excludes insignificant VIEs from previously exited businesses. 
 (2) Represents the carrying amount of assets and liabilities of the VIE, which includes the seller s interest and repurchased notes held by other related parties. 
 (3) In certain investment structures, we consolidate a VIE which holds as its primary asset an investment in an unconsolidated VIE. In these instances, we disclose the carrying amount of assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as unconsolidated VIEs to avoid duplicating our exposure, as the unconsolidated VIEs are generally the operating entities generating the exposure. The carrying amount of assets and liabilities included in the unconsolidated VIE columns above related to these investment structures were billion of assets and million of liabilities as of September 30, 2024, and billion of assets and million of liabilities as of December 31, 2023. 
 (4) Primarily consists of variable interests in companies that promote renewable energy sources and other equity method investments. 
 Securitization-Related VIEs 
 In a securitization transaction, assets are transferred to a trust, which generally meets the definition of a VIE. We engage in securitization activities as an issuer and an investor. Our primary securitization issuance activity includes credit card and auto securitizations, conducted through securitization trusts which we consolidate. Our continuing involvement in these securitization transactions mainly consists of acting as the primary servicer and holding certain retained interests. 
 In our multifamily agency business, we originate multifamily commercial real estate loans and transfer them to government-sponsored enterprises GSEs who may, in turn, securitize them. We retain the related mortgage servicing rights MSRs and service the transferred loans pursuant to the guidelines set forth by the GSEs. As an investor, we hold primarily RMBS, CMBS, and ABS in our investment securities portfolio, which represent variable interests in the respective securitization trusts from which those securities were issued. We do not consolidate the securitization trusts employed in these transactions as we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these securitization trusts. We exclude these VIEs from the tables within this note because we do not consider our continuing involvement with these VIEs to be significant as we either solely invest in securities issued by the VIE and were not involved in the design of the VIE or no transfers have occurred between the VIE and ourselves. Our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with these VIEs is the carrying value of the MSRs and investment securities on our consolidated balance sheets as well as our contractual obligations under loss sharing arrangements. See Note 14 Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others for information about the loss sharing agreements, Note 7 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for information related to our MSRs associated with these securitizations and Note 3 Investment Securities for more information on the securities held in our investment securities portfolio. In addition, where we have certain lending arrangements in the normal course of business with entities that could be VIEs, we have excluded these VIEs from the tables presented in this note. See Note 4 Loans for additional information regarding our lending arrangements in the normal course of business.

 Credit Card Securitizations 
 We securitize a portion of our credit card loans which provides a source of funding for us. Credit card securitizations involve the transfer of credit card receivables to securitization trusts. These trusts then issue debt securities collateralized by the transferred receivables to third-party investors. We hold certain retained interests in our credit card securitizations and continue to service the receivables in these trusts. We consolidate these trusts because we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary as we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts, and the right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the trusts. 
 Auto Securitizations 
 Similar to our credit card securitizations, we securitize a portion of our auto loans which provides a source of funding for us. Auto securitizations involve the transfer of auto loans to securitization trusts. These trusts then issue debt securities collateralized by the transferred loans to third-party investors. We hold certain retained interests and continue to service the loans in these trusts. We consolidate these trusts because we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary as we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts, and the right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the trusts. 
 Other VIEs 
 Affordable Housing Entities 
 As part of our community reinvestment initiatives, we invest in private investment funds that make equity investments in multifamily affordable housing properties, a majority of which are VIEs. We receive affordable housing tax credits for these investments. The activities of these entities are financed with a combination of invested equity capital and debt. We account for our investments in qualified affordable housing projects using the proportional amortization method, where costs of the investment are amortized over the period in which the investor expects to receive tax credits and other tax benefits, and the resulting amortization is recognized as a component of income tax expense attributable to continuing operations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized amortization of million and million, respectively, and tax credits of million and million, respectively, associated with these investments within income tax provision. The carrying value of our equity investments in these qualified affordable housing projects was billion and billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We are periodically required to provide additional financial or other support during the period of the investments. Our liability for these unfunded commitments was billion and billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and is largely expected to be paid from 2024 to 2027.

 billion and billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The creditors of the VIEs have no recourse to our general credit and we do not provide additional financial or other support other than during the period that we are contractually required to provide it. The total assets of the unconsolidated VIE investment funds were approximately billion and billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Entities that Provide Capital to Low-Income and Rural Communities 
 We hold variable interests in entities Investor Entities that invest in community development entities CDEs that provide debt financing to businesses and non-profit entities in low-income and rural communities. Variable interests in the CDEs held by the consolidated Investor Entities are also our variable interests. The activities of the Investor Entities are financed with a combination of invested equity capital and debt. The activities of the CDEs are financed solely with invested equity capital. We receive federal and state tax credits for these investments. We consolidate the VIEs in which we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and where we have the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We consolidate other investments and CDEs that are not considered to be VIEs, but where we hold a controlling financial interest. The assets of the VIEs that we consolidated, which totaled approximately billion and billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets in cash, loans held for investment, and other assets. The liabilities are reflected in other liabilities. The creditors of the VIEs have no recourse to our general credit. We have not provided additional financial or other support other than during the period that we are contractually required to provide it. 
 Other 
 We hold variable interests in other VIEs, including companies that promote renewable energy sources and other equity method investments. We are not required to consolidate these VIEs because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact their economic performance. Our maximum exposure to these VIEs is limited to the investments on our consolidated balance sheets of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The creditors of the other VIEs have no recourse to our general credit. We have not provided additional financial or other support other than during the period that we are contractually required to provide it.

The maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions were hedged was approximately years as of September 30, 2024. The amount we expect to reclassify into earnings may change as a result of changes in market conditions and ongoing actions taken as part of our overall risk management strategy.

 Significant Level 3 Fair Value Asset and Liability Inputs 
 Generally, uncertainties in fair value measurements of financial instruments, such as changes in unobservable inputs, may have a significant impact on fair value. Certain of these unobservable inputs will, in isolation, have a directionally consistent impact on the fair value of the instrument for a given change in that input. Alternatively, the fair value of the instrument may move in an opposite direction for a given change in another input. In general, an increase in the discount rate, default rates, loss severity or credit spreads, in isolation, would result in a decrease in the fair value measurement. In addition, an increase in default rates would generally be accompanied by a decrease in recovery rates, slower prepayment rates and an increase in liquidity spreads, and would lead to a decrease in the fair value measurement.

 (2) Due to the nature of the various mortgage securitization structures in which we have retained interests, it is not meaningful to present a consolidated weighted average for the significant unobservable inputs.

 Loss Sharing Agreements 
 Within our Commercial Banking business, we originate multifamily commercial real estate loans with the intent to sell them to the GSEs. We enter into loss sharing agreements with the GSEs upon the sale of these originated loans. Beginning January 1, 2020, we elected the fair value option on new loss sharing agreements entered into. Unrealized gains and losses are recorded in other non-interest income in our consolidated statements of income. For those loss sharing agreements entered into as of and prior to December 31, 2019, we amortize the liability recorded at inception into non-interest income as we are released from risk of having to make a payment and record our estimate of expected credit losses each period through the provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of income. The liability recognized on our consolidated balance sheets for these loss sharing agreements was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. See Note 5 Allowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments for information related to our credit card partnership loss sharing arrangements.

 million. Our reserve and reasonably possible loss estimates involve considerable judgment and reflect that there is significant uncertainty regarding numerous factors that may impact the ultimate loss levels. Notwithstanding our attempt to estimate a reasonably possible range of loss beyond our current accrual levels for some litigation matters based on current information, it is possible that actual future losses will exceed both the current accrual level and reasonably possible losses disclosed here. Given the inherent uncertainties involved in these matters and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these, there is significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability we may incur from these litigation matters and an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period. 
 Interchange Litigation 
 In 2005, a putative class of retail merchants filed antitrust lawsuits against MasterCard and Visa and several issuing banks, including Capital One, seeking both injunctive relief and monetary damages for an alleged conspiracy by defendants to fix the level of interchange fees. The Visa and MasterCard payment networks and issuing banks entered into settlement and judgment sharing agreements allocating the liabilities of any judgment or settlement arising from all interchange-related cases. 
 The lawsuits were consolidated before the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York for certain purposes and were settled in 2012. The class settlement, however, was invalidated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in June 2016, and the suit was bifurcated into separate class actions seeking injunctive and monetary relief, respectively. In addition, numerous merchant groups opted out of the 2012 settlement. 
 The monetary relief class action settled for 5.5 billion and was approved by the District Court in December 2019. The Second Circuit affirmed the settlement in March 2023, and it is final. Some of the merchants that opted out of the monetary relief class have brought cases, and some of those cases have settled and some remain pending. Visa created a litigation escrow account following its initial public offering of stock in 2008 that funds the portion of these settlements attributable to Visa-allocated transactions. Any settlement amounts based on MasterCard-allocated transactions that have not already been paid are reflected in our reserves. Visa and MasterCard reached a settlement with the injunctive relief class and filed a motion for preliminary approval, which was denied by the District Court in June 2024. The parties will continue to litigate unless a settlement is reached and approved. 
 Cybersecurity Incident 
 On July 29, 2019, we announced that on March 22 and 23, 2019 an outside individual gained unauthorized access to our systems. This individual obtained certain types of personal information relating to people who had applied for our credit card products and to our credit card customers (the 2019 Cybersecurity Incident ). As a result of the 2019 Cybersecurity Incident, we have been subject to numerous legal proceedings and other inquiries and could be the subject of additional proceedings and inquiries in the future. 
 Consumer class actions . We are named as a defendant in putative consumer class action cases in Canadian courts alleging harm from the 2019 Cybersecurity Incident and seeking various remedies, including monetary and injunctive relief. The lawsuits allege breach of contract, negligence, violations of various privacy laws and a variety of other legal causes of action. In the second quarter of 2022, a trial court in British Columbia preliminarily certified a class of all impacted Canadian consumers except those in Quebec. The preliminary certification decision in British Columbia was appealed, with both sides contesting portions of the ruling. On July 4, 2024, the British Columbia Court of Appeals denied both parties appeals. In the third quarter of 2023, a trial court in Quebec preliminarily authorized a class of all impacted consumers in Quebec. This

 million penalty to the U.S. Treasury as part of the OCC agreement. The Federal Reserve agreement did not contain a monetary penalty. The OCC lifted its consent order on August 31, 2022 and the Federal Reserve lifted its consent order on July 5, 2023. On August 12, 2019, Canada s Office of Privacy Commissioner OPC also initiated an investigation into the 2019 Cybersecurity Incident. That investigation concluded in April 2024 with no further action required. 
 U.K. PPI Litigation 
 In the U.K., we previously sold payment protection insurance PPI ). For several years leading up to the claims submission deadline of August 29, 2019 (as set by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority FCA )), we received customer complaints and regulatory claims relating to PPI. COEP has materially resolved the PPI complaints and regulatory claims received prior to the deadline. Some of the claimants in the U.K. PPI regulatory claims process have subsequently initiated legal proceedings, seeking additional redress. We are responding to these proceedings as we receive them. 
 Savings Account Litigation and Related Government Investigation 
 On July 10, 2023, we were sued in a putative class action in the Eastern District of Virginia by savings account holders alleging breach of contract and a variety of other causes of action relating to our introduction of a new savings account product with a higher interest rate than existing savings account products Savings Account Litigation ). Since the original suit, we have also been sued in six similar putative class actions in federal courts in California, Illinois, Ohio, Virginia, New Jersey and New York. On March 20, 2024, we filed with the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation a motion to consolidate and transfer related actions to the Eastern District of Virginia. In June 2024, the Judicial Panel granted the motion and transferred the related actions to the Eastern District of Virginia. Plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint on July 1, 2024 and the court set a trial date in July 2025. We filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint, which is fully briefed and pending with the court. 
 In August 2024, we received a Civil Investigative Demand from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB relating to the savings account products at issue in the litigation. In October 2024, the CFPB issued a Notice of Opportunity to Respond and Advise NORA letter indicating that the CFPB is considering an enforcement action against us on similar grounds as the claims in the Savings Account Litigation. We are responding to the NORA letter and it is possible the CFPB will pursue an enforcement action, including possible litigation, at the end of the NORA process. 
 Other Pending and Threatened Litigation 
 In addition, we are commonly subject to various pending and threatened legal actions relating to the conduct of our normal business activities. In the opinion of management, the ultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising out of all such other pending or threatened legal actions is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial position or our results of operations. 
 Other Contingencies 
 Deposit Insurance Assessments 
 On November 16, 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC finalized a rule to implement a special assessment to recover the loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund DIF arising from the protection of uninsured depositors in connection with the systemic risk determination announced on March 12, 2023, following the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. In December 2023, the FDIC provided notification that they would be collecting the special assessment at an annual rate of approximately 13.4 basis points bps over eight quarterly collection periods, beginning with the first quarter of 2024 with the first payment due on June 28, 2024. In June 2024, the FDIC provided notification that the collection period will be extended an additional two quarters beyond the initial eight quarterly collection periods at a lower annual rate. The special assessment base is equal to an insured depository institution s estimated uninsured deposits reported on its Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income as of December 31, 2022 2022 Call Report ), adjusted to exclude the first 5 billion of uninsured deposits. We recognized million in operating expense in the fourth quarter of 2023 associated with the special assessment

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As required by Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act ), our management, including the CEO and CFO, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Report. Based upon that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024, at a reasonable level of assurance, in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting information required to be disclosed within the time periods specified by the SEC rules and forms. 
 (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 We regularly review our disclosure controls and procedures and make changes intended to ensure the quality of our financial reporting. There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred in the third quarter of 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
