LIGHTSTONE VALUE PLUS REIT II, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

 (Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share/unit data and where indicated in millions) 

 (Unaudited) 

 general partnership interest in the Operating Partnership s common units. 

Lightstone REIT II and the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the Company and the use of we, our, us or similar pronouns in these consolidated financial statements refers to Lightstone REIT II, its Operating Partnership or the Company as required by the context in which such pronoun is used. 

Through the Operating Partnership, the Company owns and operates commercial properties and makes real estate-related investments. Since its inception, the Company has primarily acquired and operated commercial hospitality properties, principally consisting of limited service hotels all located in the U.S. Although the Company has historically acquired hotels, it has and may continue to purchase other types of real estate. Assets other than hotels may include, without limitation, office buildings, shopping centers, business and industrial parks, manufacturing facilities, single-tenant properties, multifamily properties, student housing properties, warehouses and distribution facilities and medical/life sciences office buildings. The Company s real estate investments are held by it alone or jointly with other parties. In addition, the Company may invest up to 20 of its net assets in collateralized debt obligations, commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS and mortgage and mezzanine loans secured, directly or indirectly, by the same types of properties which it may acquire directly. Although most of its investments are these types, the Company may invest in whatever types of real estate or real estate-related investments that it believes are in its best interests. The Company evaluates all of its real estate investments as one operating segment. The Company currently intends to hold its investments until such time as it determines that a sale or other disposition appears to be advantageous to achieve its investment objectives or until it appears that the objectives will not be met. 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company (i) majority owned and consolidated the operating results and financial condition of 10 limited service hotels containing a total of 1,352 rooms, (ii) held an unconsolidated membership interest in Brownmill, LLC (the Brownmill Joint Venture ), an affiliated entity that owns two retail properties, and (iii) held an unconsolidated 50 membership interest in LVP LIC Hotel JV LLC (the Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture ), an affiliated real estate entity that owns one hotel. The Company accounts for its membership interests in the Brownmill Joint Venture and the Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture under the equity method of accounting. 

The Brownmill Joint Venture owns Browntown Shopping Center, located in Old Bridge, New Jersey, and Millburn Mall, located in Vauxhaull, New Jersey. The Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture owns a 183-room, limited service hotel (the Hilton Garden Inn Long Island City) located in the Long Island City neighborhood in the Queens borough of New York City. Both the Brownmill Joint Venture and the Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture are between the Company and related parties. 

As of September 30, 2024, five of the Company s consolidated limited service hotels are held in LVP Holdco JV LLC (the Hotel Joint Venture ), a joint venture formed between the Company and Lightstone Value Plus REIT I, Inc. Lightstone REIT I ), a related party REIT also sponsored by The Lightstone Group, LLC (the Sponsor ). The Company and Lightstone REIT I have 97.5 and 2.5 membership interests in the Hotel Joint Venture, respectively. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, one of the Company s consolidated hotels also has ownership interests held by unrelated minority owners. The membership interests of Lightstone REIT I and the unrelated minority owners are accounted for as noncontrolling interests. 

The Company s advisor is Lightstone Value Plus REIT II LLC (the Advisor ), which is majority owned by David Lichtenstein. On May 20, 2008, the Advisor contributed to the Operating Partnership in exchange for limited partner common units in the Operating Partnership. The Advisor also owns shares of the Company s common stock Common Shares which were issued on May 20, 2008 for , or per share. Mr. Lichtenstein also is a majority owner of the equity interests of the Sponsor, which served as the Company s sponsor during its initial public offering and follow-on offering (collectively, the Offerings ), which terminated on August 15, 2012 and September 27, 2014, respectively. The Advisor, pursuant to the terms of an advisory agreement, together with the Company s board of directors (the Board of Directors ), is primarily responsible for making investment decisions on behalf of the Company and managing its day-to-day operations. 

Through his ownership and control of the Sponsor, Mr. Lichtenstein is the indirect owner and manager of Lightstone SLP II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the Associate General Partner ), which owns 177 subordinated profits interests Subordinated Profits Interests in the Operating Partnership, which were acquired, at a cost of per unit, or aggregate consideration of million in connection with the Company s Offerings. Mr. Lichtenstein also acts as the Company s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. As a result, he exerts influence over but does not control Lightstone REIT II or the Operating Partnership. 

The Company has no employees. The Company is dependent on the Advisor and certain affiliates of the Sponsor for performing a full range of services that are essential to it, including asset management, property management (excluding our hospitality properties, which are each managed by an unrelated third party property manager) and acquisition, disposition and financing activities, and other general administrative responsibilities, such as tax, accounting, legal, information technology and investor relations services. If the Advisor and certain affiliates of the Sponsor are unable to provide these services to the Company, it would be required to provide the services itself or obtain the services from other parties. 

The Company s Common Shares are not currently listed on a national securities exchange. The Company may seek to list its Common Shares for trading on a national securities exchange only if a majority of its independent directors believe listing would be in the best interest of its stockholders. The Company does not intend to list its shares at this time. The Company does not anticipate that there would be any active market for its Common Shares until they are listed for trading. 

Noncontrolling Interests 

Partners of the Operating Partnership 

Limited Partner 

On May 20, 2008, the Advisor contributed 2 to the Operating Partnership in exchange for 200 limited partner common units in the Operating Partnership. The Advisor has the right to convert its limited partner common units into cash or, at the Company s option, an equal number of Common Shares. 

Associate General Partner 

In connection with the Company s Offerings, the Sponsor and its wholly owned subsidiary, Lightstone Holdings LLC LGH ), contributed (i) cash of million and (ii) equity interests totaling in the Brownmill Joint Venture, which were valued at million, to the Operating Partnership in exchange for it issuing Subordinated Profits Interests in the Operating Partnership to the Associate General Partner at a cost of per unit, with an aggregate value of million. 

As the indirect majority owner of the Associate General Partner, Mr. Lichtenstein is the beneficial owner of a 99 interest in such Subordinated Profits Interests and thus receives an indirect benefit from any distributions made in respect thereof. 

These Subordinated Profits Interests may entitle the Associate General Partner to a portion of any regular distributions that the Company makes to its stockholders, but only after its stockholders have received a stated preferred return. However, there have been no distributions declared on the Subordinated Profits Interests for any periods after December 31, 2019. Since the Company s inception through September 30, 2024, the cumulative distributions declared and paid on the Subordinated Profits Interests were 7.9 million. Any future distributions on the Subordinated Profits Interests will always be subordinated until stockholders receive a stated preferred return. 

The Subordinated Profits Interests may also entitle the Associate General Partner to a portion of any liquidating distributions made by the Operating Partnership. The value of such distributions will depend upon the net proceeds available for distribution upon the liquidation of the Company and, therefore, cannot be determined at the present time. Liquidating distributions to the Associate General Partner will always be subordinated until stockholders receive a distribution equal to their initial investment plus a stated preferred return. 

Other Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Subsidiaries 

Other noncontrolling interests consist of the (i) membership interest in the Joint Venture held by Lightstone REIT I and (ii) membership interests held by minority owners in one of the Company s hotels. 

Related Parties 

The Company s Sponsor, Advisor and their affiliates, including the Associate General Partner and LGH, are related parties of the Company as well as the other public REITs also sponsored and/or advised by these entities. Pursuant to the terms of various agreements, certain of these entities are entitled to compensation and reimbursement for services and costs incurred related to the investment, development, management and disposition of the Company s assets. The compensation is generally based on the cost of acquired properties/investments and the annual revenue earned from such properties/investments, and other such fees and expense reimbursements as outlined in each of the respective agreements. 

 general partnership interest in the common units of the Operating Partnership. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In addition, interests in entities acquired are evaluated based on accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. GAAP ), and entities deemed to be variable interest entities VIE in which the Company is the primary beneficiary are also consolidated. If the interest in the entity is determined not to be a VIE, then the entity is evaluated for consolidation based on legal form, economic substance, and the extent to which the Company has control, substantive participating rights or both under the respective ownership agreement. For entities in which the Company has less than a controlling interest or entities which it is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary, it accounts for the investment using the equity method of accounting. 

The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company and related notes as contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Form 10-K ). The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) and accruals necessary in the judgment of management for a fair statement of the results for the periods presented. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Lightstone Value Plus REIT II, Inc. and Subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. 

GAAP requires the Company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during a reporting period. The most significant assumptions and estimates relate to the valuation of investment properties and investments in other unconsolidated real estate entities and depreciable lives of long-lived assets. Application of these assumptions requires the exercise of judgment as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. 

The consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 included herein has been derived from the consolidated balance sheet included in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 

The unaudited consolidated statements of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year or any other period. 

of its REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain. If the Company fails to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT in any subsequent year and does not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, its income for that year will be taxed at regular corporate rates, and it may be precluded from qualifying for treatment as a REIT for the four-year period following its failure to qualify as a REIT. Such an event could materially adversely affect the Company s net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders. Additionally, even if the Company continues to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it may still be subject to some U.S. federal, state and local taxes on its income and property and to U.S. federal income taxes and excise taxes on its undistributed income, if any. 

To maintain its qualification as a REIT, the Company engages in certain activities through a taxable REIT subsidiary TRS ), including when it acquires a hotel it usually establishes a new TRS and enters into an operating lease agreement for the hotel. As such, the Company is subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes and franchise taxes from these activities. 

The Company s income tax benefit and expense are included in other income/(expense), net on its consolidated statements of operations. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an income tax expense of million and , respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded income tax expense of million and million, respectively.

On July 18, 2023 and July 21, 2023, the Sellers completed the disposition of the Florida Hotels to the Florida Hotels Buyer pursuant to the terms of the Florida Hotels Agreement. In connection with these transactions, the Sellers used an aggregate of million of the net proceeds to make required principal paydowns on a nonrecourse revolving loan (the Revolving Loan in order for the Florida Hotels to be released from its pledged collateral pool. The Hotel Joint Venture s net proceeds from the disposition of the Florida Hotels were 10.3 million (of which the Company s share was 10.0 million and Lightstone REIT I s share was 0.3 million) after the aforementioned principal paydowns, pro rations, and closing and other related transaction costs. In connection with the disposition of the Florida Hotels, the Company recognized a gain on the sale of investment property of million during the third quarter of 2023.

Fair Value Measurements 

Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. 

The standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value: 

Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2 Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 

Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s mutual funds were classified as Level 1 assets and its equity securities were classified as Level 2 assets. The fair values of the Company s investments in mutual funds are measured using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and its investments in equity securities are measured using readily available quoted prices for these securities; however, the markets for the equity securities are not active. There were no transfers between the level classifications during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable and other assets, accounts payable and other accrued expenses, distribution payable and due to related party approximated their fair values as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 because of the short maturity of these instruments. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the estimated fair value of our mortgage payable approximated its carrying value because it bears interest at a floating rate. 

Margin loan 

The Company has access to a margin loan from a financial institution that holds custody of certain of the Company s marketable securities. The margin loan is collateralized by the marketable securities in the Company s account. The amounts available to the Company under the margin loan are at the discretion of the financial institution and not limited to the amount of collateral in its account. amounts were outstanding under this margin loan as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

In connection with entering into the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company deposited million into a cash collateral reserve account. 

If a principal paydown is deemed necessary to achieve compliance with respect to the financial debt covenants for any quarterly period, the lender may, if it so chooses, apply the necessary amount of the funds held in the cash collateral reserve account towards the required principal paydown. Additionally, if there are not sufficient funds held in the cash collateral reserve account to make the necessary principal paydown, the lender may, if it so chooses, require the Company to fund the shortfall. 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company met the minimum prescribed debt yield ratio but did not meet the prescribed minimum DSCR and therefore, the lender may, at its sole discretion, require a principal paydown of million using funds held in the cash collateral reserve account.

Other noncontrolling interests consist of the (i) membership interest in the Hotel Joint Venture held by Lightstone REIT I and (ii) membership interests held by minority owners in one of our hotels. 

Related Parties 

Our Sponsor, Advisor and their affiliates, including the Associate General Partner and LGH, are related parties of ours as well as other public REITs also sponsored and/or advised by these entities. Pursuant to the terms of various agreements, certain of these entities are entitled to compensation and reimbursement of costs incurred for services related to the investment, development, management and disposition of our assets. The compensation is generally based on the cost of acquired properties/investments and the annual revenue earned from such properties/investments, and other such fees and expense reimbursements as outlined in each of the respective agreements. 

Concentration of Credit Risk 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash deposited in certain financial institutions in excess of U.S. federally insured levels. We regularly monitor the financial stability of these financial institutions and believe that we are not exposed to any significant credit risk with respect to our cash and cash equivalents or restricted cash.

Current Environment 

Our operating results and financial condition are substantially impacted by the overall health of local, U.S. national and global economies and may be influenced by market and other challenges. Additionally, our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by current and future economic and other conditions; including, but not limited to, availability or terms of financings, financial markets volatility and banking failures, political upheaval or uncertainty, natural and man-made disasters, terrorism and acts of war, unfavorable changes in laws and regulations, outbreaks of contagious diseases, cybercrime, loss of key relationships, inflation and recession. 

Our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions and their impacts on consumer behavior. Worsening economic conditions, increases in costs due to inflation, higher interest rates, labor and supply chain challenges and other changes in economic conditions could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition. 

We are not currently aware of any other material trends or uncertainties, favorable or unfavorable, that may be reasonably anticipated to have a material impact on either capital resources or the revenues or income to be derived from our operations, other than those referred to above or throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during a reporting period.

Results of Operations 

Disposition Activities 

Florida Hotels 

On July 18, 2023 and July 21, 2023, we, through majority owned and consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the Sellers ), completed the sales of (i) a 126-room limited service hotel located in Miami, Florida (the Hampton Inn - Miami and (ii) a 104-room limited service hotel located in Fort Lauderdale, Florida (the Hampton Inn Suites - Fort Lauderdale and collectively, the Florida Hotels to unaffiliated third parties for an aggregate contractual sales prices of 28.0 million. In connection with the sale of the Florida Hotels, we recognized a gain on the sale of investment property of 0.2 million during the third quarter of 2023. Previously, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of 5.0 million during the second quarter of 2023 on the consolidated statements of operations to reduce the carrying value of the Florida Hotels to their fair value less the estimated costs to sell. 

The dispositions of the Florida Hotels (the Dispositions did not qualify to be reported as discontinued operations since they did not represent a strategic shift that had a major effect on our operations and financial results. Accordingly, the operating results of the Dispositions are reflected in our results from continuing operations for all periods presented through their respective dates of disposition. 

Properties owned by us during the entire periods presented are referred to as our Same Store properties.

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Overview : 

As of September 30, 2024, we had 27.7 million of cash on hand, 4.8 million of restricted cash and 9.8 million of marketable securities. We currently believe that these items, along with revenues generated from our properties, interest and dividend income earned on our marketable securities, proceeds from the potential sale of marketable securities, and potential distributions received from our investments in unconsolidated affiliated entities will be sufficient to satisfy our expected cash requirements for at least twelve months from the date of filing this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our expected cash requirements primarily consist of our anticipated operating expenses, scheduled debt service (excluding balloon payments due at maturity), capital expenditures (excluding non-recurring capital expenditures), contributions to our investments in unconsolidated affiliated entities, redemptions and cancellations of Common Shares, if approved, tender offers for our Common Shares and distributions, if any, required to maintain our status as a REIT for the foreseeable future. However, we may also obtain additional funds, if necessary, through additional selective asset dispositions, joint venture arrangements, new borrowings and refinancing of existing borrowings. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had mortgage indebtedness totaling 101.8 million. We have and intend to continue to limit our aggregate long-term permanent borrowings to 75 of the aggregate fair market value of all properties unless any excess borrowing is approved by a majority of our independent directors and is disclosed to our stockholders. Market conditions will dictate the overall leverage limit; as such our aggregate long-term permanent borrowings may be less than 75 of aggregate fair market value of all properties. We may also incur short-term indebtedness, having a maturity of two years or less. 

Our charter provides that the aggregate amount of our borrowing, both secured and unsecured, may not exceed 300 of net assets in the absence of a justification showing that a higher level is appropriate, the approval of our Board of Directors and disclosure to stockholders. Net assets means our total assets, other than intangibles, at cost before deducting depreciation or other non-cash reserves less our total liabilities, calculated at least quarterly on a basis consistently applied. Any excess in borrowing over such 300 of net assets level must be approved by a majority of our independent directors and disclosed to our stockholders in our next quarterly report to stockholders, along with justification for such excess. Market conditions will dictate our overall leverage limit; as such our aggregate borrowings may be less than 300 of net assets. As of September 30, 2024, our total borrowings aggregated 101.8 million which represented 68 of our net assets. 

Additionally, in order to leverage our investments in marketable securities and seek a higher rate of return, we have access to borrowings under a margin loan. This margin loan is due on demand and any outstanding balance must be paid upon the liquidation of our securities. 

Any future properties that we may acquire may be funded through a combination of borrowings and the proceeds received from the selective disposition of certain of our real estate assets. These borrowings may consist of single-property mortgages as well as mortgages cross-collateralized by a pool of properties. Such mortgages may be put in place either at the time we acquire a property or subsequent to our purchasing a property for cash. In addition, we may acquire properties that are subject to existing indebtedness where we choose to assume the existing mortgages. Generally, though not exclusively, we intend to seek to encumber our properties with debt, which will be on a non-recourse basis. This means that a lender s rights on default will generally be limited to foreclosing on the property. However, we may, at our discretion, secure recourse financing or provide a guarantee to lenders if we believe this may result in more favorable terms. When we give a guaranty for a property owning entity, we will be responsible to the lender for the satisfaction of the indebtedness if it is not paid by the property owning entity. 

We may also obtain lines of credit to be used to acquire properties. If obtained, these lines of credit will be at prevailing market terms and will be repaid from proceeds from the sale or refinancing of properties, working capital and/or permanent financing. Our Sponsor and/or its affiliates may guarantee our lines of credit although they are not obligated to do so. We expect that such properties may be purchased by our Sponsor s affiliates on our behalf, in our name, in order to minimize the imposition of a transfer tax upon a transfer of such properties to us. 

31 

We have an advisory agreement with the Advisor and various agreements with certain affiliates of our Sponsor which provide for us to pay certain fees in exchange for services performed by them on our behalf. Additionally, our ability to secure financing and our real estate operations are dependent upon our Advisor and certain affiliates of our Sponsor to perform such services as specified in these agreements. 

In addition to meeting working capital needs and distributions, if any, made to maintain our status as a REIT, our capital resources are used to make various payments to our Advisor and certain affiliates of our Sponsor, such as payments of fees related to asset acquisitions, asset management, and property management (excluding our hospitality properties, each of which are managed by an unrelated third party property manager) as well the reimbursement of acquisition-related expenses and actual expenses incurred for administrative and other services provided to us. 

The advisory agreement has a one year term and is renewable for an unlimited number of successive one year periods upon the mutual consent of the Advisor and our independent directors. 

The following table represents the fees incurred associated with the services provided by our Advisor for the periods indicated:

The Board of Directors will consider various factors in its determination, including but not limited to, the sources and availability of capital, revenues and other sources of income, operating and interest expenses and our ability to refinance near-term debt as well as the IRS s annual distribution requirement that REITs distribute no less than 90 of their taxable income. We cannot assure that any future distributions will be made or that we will maintain any particular level of distributions that we have previously established or may establish.

We commenced a tender offer on April 24, 2024, pursuant to which we offered to acquire up to 700,000 of our Common Shares at a purchase price of 6.00 per share, or 4.2 million in the aggregate (the 2024 Tender Offer ).

On March 19, 2020, the Board of Directors amended the SRP to remove stockholder notice requirements and also approved the suspension of all redemptions. 

Effective May 10, 2021, the Board of Directors partially reopened the SRP to allow, subject to various conditions as set forth below, for redemptions submitted in connection with a stockholder s death and hardship, respectively, and set the price for all such purchases to our current estimated net asset value per share of common stock, as determined by our board of directors and reported by us from time to time.

We received an initial advance of 101.8 million under the Revolving Credit Facility and designated 10 hotel properties as collateral. The Revolving Credit Facility bears interest at SOFR plus 3.45 , subject to a 6.45 floor, with an initial scheduled maturity of September 15, 2026, subject to two, one-year extension options at the sole discretion of the lender, and provides for monthly interest-only payments with the unpaid principal balance due at maturity. The Revolving Credit Facility provides for borrowings up to 65 of the loan-to-value ratio of properties designated as collateral and also requires the maintenance of certain covenants, including prescribed minimum debt service coverage ratio DSCR and debt yield ratio which if not met may also be achieved through principal paydowns on the outstanding balance. In connection with entering into the Revolving Credit Facility, we deposited 4.0 million into a cash collateral reserve account. 

If a principal paydown is deemed necessary to achieve compliance with respect to the financial debt covenants for any quarterly period, the lender may, if it so chooses, apply the necessary amount of the funds held in the cash collateral reserve account towards the required principal paydown. Additionally, if there are not sufficient funds held in the cash collateral reserve account, the lender may, if it so chooses, require us to fund the shortfall. 

As of September 30, 2024, we met the minimum prescribed debt yield ratio but did not meet the prescribed minimum DSCR and therefore, the lender may, at its sole discretion, require a principal paydown of 2.1 million using funds held in the cash collateral reserve account. 

As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Credit Facility was 101.8 million and its interest rate was 8.41 . Additionally, all 10 of our majority-owned and consolidated hotel properties were pledged as collateral and no additional borrowings were available under the Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024. 

Pursuant to the terms of our loan agreements, escrows in the amount of 4.8 million and 4.5 million were held in restricted cash accounts as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Such escrows will be released in accordance with the applicable loan agreements for payments of real estate taxes, debt service payments, insurance and capital improvement transactions, as required. 

In addition to the Revolving Credit Facility, we have access to a margin loan from another financial institution that holds custody of certain of our marketable securities. The margin loan is collateralized by the marketable securities in our account. The amounts available to us under the margin loan are at the discretion of the financial institution and not limited to the amount of collateral in our account. No amounts were outstanding under this margin loan as of September 30, 2024. Any borrowings under the margin loan bear interest at SOFR plus 0.85 (5.81 as of September 30, 2024).

Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliated Entities 

Brownmill Joint Venture 

During 2010 through 2012, we entered into various contribution agreements with LGH, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Sponsor and a related party, pursuant to which LGH contributed to our Operating Partnership an aggregate 48.6 membership interest in the Brownmill Joint Venture in exchange for it issuing an aggregate of 48 units of Subordinated Profits Interests to the Associate General Partner at 100,000 per unit, with an aggregate total value of 4.8 million. 

Our 48.6 membership interest in the Brownmill Joint Venture is a non-managing interest. LGH is the majority owner and manager of the Brownmill Joint Venture. Profit and cash distributions are allocated in accordance with each investor s ownership percentage. We account for our investment in the Brownmill Joint Venture in accordance with the equity method of accounting. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we received distributions from the Brownmill Joint Venture of 0.6 million and 0.4 million, respectively. 

Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture 

On March 27, 2018, we and Lightstone Value Plus REIT III, Inc. Lightstone REIT III ), a related party REIT also sponsored by the Sponsor, acquired, through the newly formed Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture, the Hilton Garden Inn - Long Island City from an unrelated third party, for aggregate consideration of 60.0 million, which consisted of 25.0 million of cash and 35.0 million of proceeds from a non-recourse loan from a financial institution (the Hilton Garden Inn Mortgage ), excluding closing and other related transaction costs. We paid 12.9 million for a 50 membership interest in the Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture. 

On May 31, 2023, the Hilton Garden Inn Mortgage was amended to provide for (i) an extension of the maturity date through May 31, 2028, (ii) the interest rate to be adjusted to SOFR plus 3.25 , subject to a 6.41 floor, (iii) interest-only payments for the first two years of its extended term with principal and interest payments pursuant to a 300-month amortization schedule thereafter and the remaining unpaid balance due in full at its maturity date of May 31, 2028, (iv) the ability to draw up to an additional 3.0 million of principal, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, and (v) certain changes to its financial covenants. Additionally, the Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture is required to fund an aggregate of 1.3 million, through monthly payments of 37 from May 31, 2023 through June 1, 2026, into a cash collateral reserve account which may be drawn upon for specified capital expenditures. 

We and Lightstone REIT III each have a 50 co-managing membership interest in the Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture. We account for our membership interest in the Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture in accordance with the equity method of accounting because we exert significant influence over but do not control the Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture. All capital contributions and distributions of earnings from the Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture are made on a pro rata basis in proportion to each member s equity interest percentage. Any distributions in excess of earnings from the Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture are made to the members pursuant to the terms of the Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture s operating agreement. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received distributions from the Hilton Garden Joint Venture of 0.9 million and made contributions of 0.1 million to the Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we received distributions from the Hilton Garden Joint Venture of 0.1 million and made contributions of 0.4 million to the Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture. 

As of September 30, 2024, the Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture was in compliance with all of its financial covenants.

Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations 

The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings, improvements, and straight-line amortization of intangibles, which implies that the value of a real estate asset diminishes predictably over time. We believe that, because real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, including, but not limited to, inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT using the historical accounting convention for depreciation and certain other items may be less informative. 

Because of these factors, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT ), an industry trade group, has published a standardized measure of performance known as funds from operations FFO ), which is used in the REIT industry as a supplemental performance measure. We believe FFO, which excludes certain items such as real estate-related depreciation and amortization, is an appropriate supplemental measure of a REIT s operating performance. FFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP. 

We calculate FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards established over time by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as restated in a White Paper approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT effective in December 2018 (the White Paper ). The White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate, gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control and impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity. Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT s definition. 

We believe that the use of FFO provides a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to management, and reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income. 

Changes in the accounting and reporting promulgations under GAAP that were put into effect in 2009 subsequent to the establishment of NAREIT s definition of FFO, such as the change to expense as incurred rather than capitalize and depreciate acquisition fees and expenses incurred for business combinations, have prompted an increase in cash-settled expenses, specifically acquisition fees and expenses, as items that are expensed under GAAP across all industries. These changes had a particularly significant impact on publicly registered, non-listed REITs, which typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity in the early part of their existence, particularly during the period when they are raising capital through ongoing initial public offerings. 

Because of these factors, the Investment Program Association (the IPA ), an industry trade group, published a standardized measure of performance known as modified funds from operations MFFO ), which the IPA has recommended as a supplemental measure for publicly registered, non-listed REITs. MFFO is designed to be reflective of the ongoing operating performance of publicly registered, non-listed REITs by adjusting for those costs that are more reflective of acquisitions and investment activity, along with other items the IPA believes are not indicative of the ongoing operating performance of a publicly registered, non-listed REIT, such as straight-lining of rents as required by GAAP. We believe it is appropriate to use MFFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance because we believe that both before and after we have deployed all of our offering proceeds, it reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income. MFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP. 

37 

We define MFFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the IPA s Guideline 2010-01, Supplemental Performance Measure for Publicly Registered, Non-Listed REITs: Modified Funds from Operations (the Practice Guideline issued by the IPA in November 2010. The Practice Guideline defines MFFO as FFO further adjusted for acquisition and transaction-related fees and expenses and other items. In calculating MFFO, we follow the Practice Guideline and exclude acquisition and transaction-related fees and expenses incurred for business combinations, amounts relating to deferred rent receivables and amortization of market lease and other intangibles, net (which are adjusted in order to reflect such payments from a GAAP accrual basis to a cash basis of disclosing the rent and lease payments), accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments and borrowings, mark-to-market adjustments included in net income (including gains or losses incurred on assets held for sale), gains or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis. Certain of the above adjustments are also made to reconcile net income (loss) to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, such as for the amortization of a premium and accretion of a discount on debt and securities investments, amortization of fees, any unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives, securities or other investments, as well as other adjustments. 

MFFO excludes non-recurring impairment of real estate-related investments. We assess the credit quality of our investments and adequacy of reserves on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as necessary. Significant judgment is required in this analysis. We consider the estimated net recoverable value of a loan as well as other factors, including but not limited to the fair value of any collateral, the amount and the status of any senior debt, the prospects for the borrower and the competitive situation of the region where the borrower does business. 

We believe that, because MFFO excludes costs that we consider more reflective of non-operating items, MFFO can provide, on a going-forward basis, an indication of the sustainability (that is, the capacity to continue to be maintained) of our operating performance once our portfolio is stabilized. We also believe that MFFO is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the non-listed REIT industry and allows for an evaluation of our performance against other publicly registered, non-listed REITs. 

Not all REITs, including publicly registered, non-listed REITs, calculate FFO and MFFO the same way. Accordingly, comparisons with other REITs, including publicly registered, non-listed REITs, may not be meaningful. Furthermore, FFO and MFFO are not indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or income (loss) from continuing operations as determined under GAAP as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operations as an indication of our liquidity, or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. FFO and MFFO should be reviewed in conjunction with other GAAP measurements as an indication of our performance. FFO and MFFO should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance. The methods utilized to evaluate the performance of a publicly registered, non-listed REIT under GAAP should be construed as more relevant measures of operational performance and considered more prominently than the non-GAAP measures, FFO and MFFO, and the adjustments to GAAP in calculating FFO and MFFO. 

Neither the SEC, NAREIT, the IPA nor any other regulatory body or industry trade group has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate FFO or MFFO. In the future, NAREIT, the IPA or another industry trade group may publish updates to the White Paper or the Practice Guidelines or the SEC or another regulatory body could standardize the allowable adjustments across the publicly registered, non-listed REIT industry, and we would have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO or MFFO accordingly.

(1) 
 Management believes that adjusting for gains or losses related to extinguishment/sale of debt, derivatives or securities holdings is appropriate because they are items that may not be reflective of ongoing operations. By excluding these items, management believes that MFFO provides supplemental information related to sustainable operations that will be more comparable between other reporting periods. 

(2) 
 Management believes that adjusting for mark-to-market adjustments is appropriate because they are nonrecurring items that may not be reflective of ongoing operations and reflects unrealized impacts on value based only on then current market conditions, although they may be based upon current operational issues related to an individual property or industry or general market conditions. Mark-to-market adjustments are made for items such as ineffective derivative instruments, certain marketable securities and any other items that GAAP requires we make a mark-to-market adjustment for. The need to reflect mark-to-market adjustments is a continuous process and is analyzed on a quarterly and/or annual basis in accordance with GAAP.
