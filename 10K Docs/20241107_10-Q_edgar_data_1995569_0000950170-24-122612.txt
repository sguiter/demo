 Overview/Introduction 
 The Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF (the Trust is a Delaware statutory trust that was formed on September 27, 2023. The Trust continuously issues common shares representing fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust Shares ). The Trust operates pursuant to its Second Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement, dated as of June 21, 2024 (the Trust Agreement ). The Shares began trading on the Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (the Exchange under the ticker symbol QETH on July 23, 2024. The Trust offers Shares only to certain eligible financial institutions Authorized Participants in one or more blocks of 5,000 Shares Creation Baskets based on the quantity of ether attributable to each Share of the Trust. 
 The following discussion and analysis was prepared to supplement information contained in the accompanying financial statements and is intended to explain certain items regarding the Trust's financial condition as of September 30, 2024, and its results of operations for the period July 23, 2024 through September 30, 2024. It should be read in conjunction with the unaudited financial statements and related notes thereto contained in this Report. 
 Investment Objective 
 The investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the spot price of ether as measured using the Lukka Prime Ethereum Reference Rate (the Benchmark less the Trust s expenses and other liabilities. The Shares are intended to provide institutional and retail investors with a simple, cost-effective means of gaining investment benefits similar to those of holding ether. 
 Determination of Net Asset Value 
 The Administrator calculates, and the Sponsor publishes, the Trust s Net Asset Value NAV once each business day. To calculate the NAV, the Administrator totals the current market value of ether in the Trust and any other assets, and subtracts any liabilities including accrued but unpaid expenses. The Trust s NAV is an amount denominated in U.S. dollars. 
 The Administrator also determines the NAV per Share, which equals the NAV of the Trust divided by the number of outstanding Shares. The NAV of the Trust and the NAV per Share are published by the Sponsor on each day that the Exchange is open for regular trading and are posted on the Trust s website, www.invesco.com/QETH. 
 13 

Valuation of Ether 
 The Trust applies FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, in the valuation of ether held by the Trust and for financial statement purposes. The fair market value price for ether reflects the price that would be received for ether in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date of ether on its principal market, generally, the most advantageous market. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. The Trust determines its principal market (or in the absence of a principal market the most advantageous market) on a periodic basis to determine which market is its Principal Market for the purpose of calculating fair value for the creation of quarterly and annual financial statements. Issuer-specific events, market trends, bid/asked quotes of brokers and information providers and other data may be reviewed in the course of making a good faith determination of a security s fair value. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The Sponsor is not aware of any known trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in, or are reasonably likely to result in, material changes to the Trust s liquidity and capital resources needs. 
 The Trust pays the Sponsor a unified fee of 0.25 per annum (the Sponsor Fee as compensation for services performed under the Trust Agreement. The Trust s only ordinary recurring expense is the Sponsor Fee. The Sponsor Fee is accrued daily and paid monthly in arrears in U.S. dollars, and is calculated by Bank of New York Mellon (the Administrator ). The Administrator calculates the Sponsor Fee on a daily basis by applying the 0.25 annualized rate to the Trust s total net assets. 
 Except as noted below, the Sponsor has agreed to pay all of the Trust s ordinary expenses out of the Sponsor s unified fee, including, but not limited to, the Trustee s fees, the fees of The Bank of New York Mellon (for its services as the Administrator, Transfer Agent, and Cash Custodian), the fees of the Ether Custodian, the fees of the Execution Agent, Exchange listing fees, SEC registration fees, printing and mailing costs, legal costs and audit fees. The Sponsor also paid the costs of the Trust s organization. 
 The Trust may incur certain extraordinary expenses that are not assumed by the Sponsor. These include, but are not limited to, taxes and governmental charges, any applicable brokerage commissions, financing fees, Ethereum network fees and similar transaction fees, expenses and costs of any extraordinary services performed by the Sponsor (or any other service provider) on behalf of the Trust to protect the Trust or the interests of Shareholders (including, for example, in connection with any fork of the Ethereum blockchain), any indemnification of the Sponsor, Cash Custodian, Ethereum Custodian, Administrator or other agents, service providers or counterparties of the Trust and extraordinary legal fees and expenses, including any legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with litigation, regulatory enforcement or investigation matters. 
 To cover the Sponsor Fee, and extraordinary expenses not assumed by the Sponsor, the Sponsor or its delegate will cause the Trust (or its delegate) to instruct Galaxy Digital Funds LLC (the Execution Agent to convert ether held by the Trust into U.S. dollars. The Execution Agent will seek to sell ether at approximately the price at which it is valued by the Trust and in the smallest amounts required to permit such payments as they become due, with the intention of minimizing the Trust s holdings of assets other than ether. Accordingly, the amount of ether to be sold may vary from time to time depending on the level of the Trust s expenses and liabilities and the market price of ether. The NAV of the Trust and the number of ether represented by a Share will decline each time the Trust accrues the Sponsor Fee or any Trust expenses not assumed by the Sponsor. The Trust is not responsible for paying any costs associated with the transfer of ether to or from the Trust in connection with paying the Sponsor Fee or in connection with creation and redemption transactions. 
 The Trust has not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Trust s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources and would be considered material to Shareholders. 
 Cash Flows 
 A primary cash flow activity of the Trust is to raise capital from Authorized Participants through the issuance of Shares. This cash is used to invest in ether. 
 As of the date of this Report, each of ABN AMRO Clearing Chicago LLC, BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC, Citadel Securities LLC, Goldman Sachs Co., Jane Street Capital LLC, Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc. and Virtu Americas LLC has executed a Participant Agreement and are the only Authorized Participants.

The total return for the Trust on a market value basis was -25.03 . 
 Since the Trust s launch on July 23, 2024, Ethereum has been pressured by broader risk-off moves and generally lackluster ETP demand. The U.S. equity market sell-off to end July, reignited hard landing concerns in the U.S., the Chinese economic overhang, and rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East all played a role, though the start of the Federal Reserve s easing cycle in September 2024 was a positive catalyst. Another influencing factor was market expectations for a potential second term as president by former President Trump, especially prior to Vice President Harris joining the presidential race in August. In this respect, former President Trump was generally viewed as more pro-crypto and could potentially seek relaxed regulations and more innovation-focused projects. 
 Trust Share Net Asset Performance 
 For the period July 23, 2024 (Commencement of Trading) to September 30, 2024, the NAV of each Share decreased from 34.60 per Share to 25.93 per Share. Falling price for ether during the period ended September 30, 2024 contributed to an overall 25.01 decrease in the level of the Benchmark. The total return for the Trust on a NAV basis was -25.06 . 
 Net income (loss) for the period ended September 30, 2024 was (3.5) million, primarily resulting from net change in unrealized gain (loss) of (3.5) million.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the Sponsor to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period covered by this report. A description of the valuation of ether, a critical accounting policy that the Trust believes is important to understanding its results of operations and financial position, is provided in the section entitled Valuation of Ether, above. 
 There were no material estimates, which involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and had or are reasonably likely to have had a material impact on the Trust s financial condition, used in the preparation of these financial statements.
