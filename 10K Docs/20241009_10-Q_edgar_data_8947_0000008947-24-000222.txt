 Contract Assets and Liabilities 
 The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in accounts receivable, contract assets (unbilled receivables), and contract liabilities (customer advances and deposits) on the consolidated balance sheets. Our contract assets and contract liabilities are primarily related to the AZZ Precoat Metals segment. Customer billing can occur subsequent to revenue recognition, resulting in contract assets. In addition, we can receive advances from our customers, before revenue is recognized, resulting in contract liabilities. These assets and liabilities are reported on the consolidated balance sheets on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. 
 The increases or decreases in contract assets and contract liabilities during the six months ended August 31, 2024 were primarily due to normal timing differences between AZZ's performance and customer payments. As of August 31, 2024 and February 29, 2024, the balance for contract assets was million and million, respectively, primarily related to the AZZ Precoat Metals segment. The increase was primarily due to the timing differences noted above, as well as the increase in the volume of coil coated for the six months ended August 31, 2024. Contract liabilities of million and million as of August 31, 2024 and February 29, 2024, respectively, are included in "Other accrued liabilities" in the consolidated balance sheets. 
 As of August 31, 2023 and February 28, 2023, the balance for contract assets was million and million, respectively, primarily related to the AZZ Precoat Metals segment. Contract liabilities were million and million as of August 31, 2023 and February 28, 2023, respectively.

. On March 20, 2024, we repriced our Term Loan B to SOFR plus , resulting in a total fixed rate of . See Note 17 for information related to the repricing of the Company's Term Loan B on September 24, 2024. Th e 2022 Swap had an initial notional amount of million and a maturity date of September 30, 2025. The notional amount of the interest rate swap decreases by a pro-rata portion of any quarterly principal payments made on the Term Loan B, and the current notional amount is million as of August 31, 2024. The objective of the 2022 Swap is to eliminate the variability of cash flows in interest payments attributable to changes in benchmark one-month SOFR interest rates, for a portion of our variable-rate debt. The hedged risk is the interest rate risk exposure to changes in interest payments, attributable to changes in benchmark one-month SOFR interest rates over the interest rate swap term. The changes in cash flows of the 2022 Swap exactly offset changes in cash flows of the variable-rate debt. We designated the 2022 Swap as a cash flow hedge at inception. Cash payments or receipts to settle the 2022 Swap are recognized in interest expense. 
 At August 31, 2024, changes in fair value attributable to the effective portion of the 2022 Swap were included on the condensed consolidated balance sheets in accumulated other comprehensive income. For derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the fair value is recognized on our condensed consolidated balance sheets as derivative assets or liabilities with offsetting changes in fair value, to the extent effective, recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income

 2022 Credit Agreement and Term Loan B 
 
 We have a credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions that was entered into on May 13, 2022, and was subsequently amended on August 17, 2023, December 20, 2023 and March 20, 2024 (collectively referred to herein as the "2022 Credit Agreement"). See Note 17 for information related to the repricing of the Company's Term Loan B on September 24, 2024. 
 The 2022 Credit Agreement includes the following significant terms: 
 i. provides for a senior secured initial term loan in the aggregate principal amount of billion (the "Term Loan B"), due May 13, 2029, which is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company; as of August 31, 2024, the outstanding balance of the Term Loan B was million; 
 ii. provides for a maximum senior secured Revolving Credit Facility in the aggregate principal amount of million (the "Revolving Credit Facility"), which matures on May 13, 2027; 
 iii. includes a letter of credit sub-facility of up to million, which is part of, and not in addition to, the Revolving Credit Facility; 
 iv. borrowings under the Term Loan B bear a tiered interest rate of Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") plus (following the repricing on March 20, 2024 as described below) and the Revolving Credit Facility bears a leverage-based rate with various tiers between and ; as of August 31, 2024, the interest rate was SOFR plus ; 
 v. includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default; including restrictions on the incurrence of non-ordinary course debt, investment and dividends, subject to various exceptions; and, 
 vi. includes a maximum quarterly leverage ratio financial covenant, with reporting requirements to our banking group at each quarter-end. 
 
 On March 20, 2024, we entered the term loan market and repriced our existing Term Loan B. The repricing reduced the Term Loan B spread from a rate of SOFR plus to SOFR plus . 
 On September 24, 2024, we completed our third repricing of the Term Loan B, for which million was outstanding as of August 31, 2024. The repricing reduced the margin from SOFR plus to SOFR plus , for a total reduction of basis points. 
 We primarily utilize proceeds from the Revolving Credit Facility to finance working capital needs, capital improvements, quarterly cash dividends, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes. 
 As defined in the 2022 Credit Agreement, quarterly prepayments were due against the outstanding principal of the Term Loan B and were payable on the last business day of each May, August, November and February, beginning August 31, 2022, in a quarterly aggregate principal amount of million, with the entire remaining principal amount due on May 13, 2029, the maturity date. Additional prepayments made against the Term Loan B contribute to these required quarterly payments. Due to prepayments made against the Term Loan B since August 31, 2022, the quarterly mandatory principal payment requirement has been met, and the quarterly payments of million are no longer required.

 Our 2022 Credit Agreement requires us to maintain a maximum Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the loan agreement) no greater than . As of August 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants and other requirements set forth in the 2022 Credit Agreement. 
 As of August 31, 2024, we had million of debt outstanding on the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan B, with varying maturities through fiscal 2029. We had approximately million of additional credit available as of August 31, 2024. 
 As of August 31, 2024, we had total outstanding letters of credit in the amount of million. These letters of credit are most commonly issued in lieu of customer retention withholding payments covering warranty, performance periods and insurance collateral. 
 
 Less: Capitalized interest ) ) ) ) Interest expense, net 
 Capitalized interest for the three and six months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023 relates to interest cost on the construction of the greenfield aluminum coil coating facility in Washington, Missouri. The increase for the six months ended August 31, 2024 compared to the prior year period was due to the higher average construction work in process.

 Non-recurring Fair Value Measurements 
 Investment in Joint Venture 
 The fair value of our investment in the unconsolidated AVAIL JV was determined using the income approach at the date on which we entered into the joint venture. The income approach uses discounted cash flow models that require various observable and non-observable inputs, such as operating margins, revenues, product costs, operating expenses, capital expenditures, terminal-year values and risk-adjusted discount rates. These valuations resulted in Level 3 non-recurring fair value measurements. 
 We assess our investment in the unconsolidated AVAIL JV for recoverability when events and circumstances are present that suggest there has been a decline in value, and if it is determined that a loss in value of the investment is other than temporary, the investment is written down to its fair value. 
 Long-Term Debt 
 The fair values of our long-term debt instruments are estimated based on market values for debt issued with similar characteristics or rates currently available for debt with similar terms. These valuations are Level 2 non-recurring fair value measurements. 
 The principal amount of our outstanding debt was million and million at August 31, 2024 and February 29, 2024, respectively. The estimated fair value of our outstanding debt was million and million at August 31, 2024 and February 29, 2024, excluding unamortized debt issuance costs. The estimated fair values of our outstanding debt were determined based on the present value of future cash flows using model-derived valuations that use observable inputs such as interest rates and credit spreads.

shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock ("Series A Preferred Stock") for million. The payment was calculated as the face value of the Series A Preferred Stock of million, multiplied by the Return Factor (as defined below) of , less dividends paid to date of million. The redemption premium of million, which was calculated as the difference between the redemption amount and the book value of million, was recorded as a deemed dividend, and reduces net income available to common shareholders. The Series A Preferred Stock was redeemed using proceeds from the April 2024 Secondary Public Offering. See Note 14. 
 On August 5, 2022, we exchanged our million convertible subordinated notes which were due June 30, 2030, for shares of Series A Preferred Stock, following the receipt of shareholder approval for the issuance of Series A Preferred Stock.

The Series A Preferred Stock is classified as "Mezzanine equity" in the consolidated balance sheets and, as noted above, was fully redeemed on May 9, 2024. 
 Liquidation Preference 
 
 If we undergo a change of control, bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation or de-listing of AZZ s common stock (a Fundamental Change Event ), holders of Series A Preferred Stock may have elected to (i) receive the as-converted value of AZZ s common stock at the then-current Conversion Price, (ii) require us to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock in cash for the Redemption Amount (as defined below) or (iii) retain their shares of Series A Preferred Stock if the Fundamental Change Event is a non-cash change of control. 
 
 The Series A Preferred Stock had a liquidation preference, as defined by U.S. GAAP, equal to the Redemption Amount. Under U.S. GAAP, the liquidation preference is defined as the amount that would be required to be paid to the shareholders upon liquidation or dissolution of the Company. As of February 29, 2024, the holders of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled to a liquidation preference of approximately million in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company as of such year end. 
 The Certificate of Designation for the Series A Preferred Stock defines "liquidation preference" as 1,000 per share plus any unpaid dividends, which we refer to herein as the "Series A Base Amount." 
 Dividends 
 The Series A Preferred Stock accumulated a dividend per annum, or per share per quarter. Dividends were payable in cash or in kind, by accreting and increasing the Series A Base Amount PIK Dividends ). Dividends were payable on the sum of (i) the aggregate liquidation preference amount of million plus (ii) any PIK Dividends. Dividends were accrued daily and paid quarterly in arrears, on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year. Following the calendar quarter ending June 30, 2027, we may not elect PIK Dividends and dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock must be paid in cash. All dividends have been paid in cash through August 31, 2024. The dividend will increase annually by one percentage point, beginning with the dividend payable for the calendar quarter ending September 30, 2028. Dividends declared and paid for the six months ended August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023 were million and million, respectively.

million in damages for breach of contract and breach of express warranty. A final judgment amount was entered by the Court on February 14, 2024, and we are still waiting on the trial transcript from the court reporter which is not expected to be made available to the parties until December 31, 2024. We believe we have strong grounds for an appeal, and will pursue all available appellate options. The appeal process is expected to take two years. As of August 31, 2024, we have recorded a legal accrual of million, which is included in "Other accrued liabilities" on our consolidated balance sheets, reflecting our best estimate of the probable loss. Our estimate of the probable loss may change throughout the appellate process. We have purchased a supersedeas bond to cover the final judgment amount throughout the duration of the appellate process. 
 A litigation matter between AZZ, as Plaintiff, and a previous customer of an affiliate of the AIS business, which was retained following the disposition of the AIS business, is scheduled to go to trial in fiscal 2026. As of August 31, 2024, we have a receivable due from the Defendant, net of allowance, of million, which is included in "Trade accounts receivable, net of allowance for credit losses" in the consolidated balance sheets. This receivable balance represents our best estimate of the amount we expect to collect, which may change following completion of the trial. 
 Prior to AZZ's acquisition of Precoat Metals on May 13, 2022, Precoat Metals sold its Armorel Arkansas facility to Nucor Coatings Corporation ("Nucor") via a purchase agreement dated October 27, 2020 ("2020 Agreement"). Nucor subsequently filed a lawsuit against Precoat Metals for indemnification for breach of environmental representations and warranties made in the 2020 Agreement. In the lawsuit, Nucor asserted that it has sustained certain damages resulting from Precoat Metal s breach of its indemnification obligations that were set forth in the 2020 Agreement. The parties attended a mediation on March 18, 2024, and although the Company believed Nucor s case was deficient and it had very strong defenses to the allegations asserted by Nucor, management determined that it was still in the best interest of the Company to settle all matters for the estimated cost of defense in an effort to retain and fortify its current commercial relationships with Nucor, who is both a customer and supplier to the Company. The parties mutually agreed to resolve all disputed matters for million. The million settlement amount was included in "Other accrued liabilities" in the consolidated balance sheet as of August 31, 2024 and February 29, 2024. The settlement amount was paid by the Company to Nucor on September 9, 2024. 
 
 On July 29, 2024, Gainesville Associates, LLC Gainesville Associates filed a complaint (the Complaint in the Circuit Court of Prince William County, Virginia against AZZ, Atlantic Research, LLC ARC ), Precoat Metals Corporation, and Chromalloy Corporation (collectively Defendants ), asserting claims for breach of contract against ARC and unjust enrichment against all Defendants. The Complaint arises out of a lease, dated January 1, 1976, between Gainesville Associates as landlord and ARC as tenant (as subsequently amended in 1982, 2012, 2013 and 2017, the Lease for property in Gainesville, Virginia (the Property ). ARC ceased using the property in 2005 after which point ARC remained in the Lease to complete its obligations on the property pursuant to a consent decree entered into between the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPA and ARC in 1992. ARC satisfied its obligations under the consent decree in 2018 (other than ongoing well water monitoring and testing) and terminated the Lease in 2019. In its Complaint, Gainesville Associates alleges that ARC breached certain provisions of the Lease. On September 3, 2024, Defendants removed the action to the United States District Court of the Eastern District of Virginia. On September 24, 2024, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Complaint in its entirety, arguing that the complaint failed to adequately allege any claim against any Defendant. Plaintiff has not yet filed its response to the Defendant s motion to dismiss. Management disputes the merits of the allegations and will continue to pursue

million, of which million is classified as current. Environmental remediation liabilities include costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up, such as materials, external contractor costs, legal and consulting expenses and incremental internal costs directly related to ongoing remediation plans. Estimates used to record environmental remediation liabilities are based on the Company's best estimate of probable future costs based on site-specific facts and circumstances known at the time of the estimate and these estimates are updated on a quarterly basis. Estimates of the cost for the potential or ongoing remediation plans are developed using internal resources and third-party environmental engineers and consultants. 
 The Company accrues the anticipated cost of environmental remediation when the obligation is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. While any revisions to the Company's environmental remediation liabilities could be material to the operating results of any fiscal quarter or fiscal year, the Company does not expect such additional remediation expenses to have an adverse material effect on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 
 Capital Commitments Greenfield Aluminum Coil Coating Facility 
 We are expanding our coatings capabilities by constructing a new -acre aluminum coil coating facility in Washington, Missouri that is expected to be operational in calendar year 2025 (the Company's fiscal year 2026).

We expect to spend approximately million in capital payments over the life of the project, of which million was paid prior to fiscal 2025 and million was paid during the six months ended August 31, 2024 . The remaining balance of million is to occur prior to the end of fiscal 2025, of which we have capital commitments of million.

We also had non-cancelable forward contracts to purchase approximately million of natural gas at various volumes and prices between June 2024 and August 2025. All such contracts expire by the first quarter of fiscal 2026. We had no other contracted commitments for any other commodities including steel, aluminum, copper, zinc, nickel-based alloys, natural gas, except for those entered into under the normal course of business.

Business Operations Update 
 Our results for the six months ended August 31, 2024 (the "current six-month period"), were favorably impacted by the growth in demand for our manufactured solutions in the construction, utilities, and transportation industries, coupled with our value driven pricing strategy. 
 The demand for our manufactured solutions was the primary contributor to net income of 75.0 million for the six months ended August 31, 2024. Our operating results for the three and six months ended August 31, 2024, including operating results by segment, are described in the summary on the following page, and detailed descriptions can be found below under Results of Operations. 
 Our operations generated 119.4 million of cash for the current six-month period. The components of our liquidity and descriptions of our cash flows, capital investments, and other matters impacting our liquidity and capital resources can be found below under Liquidity and Capital Resources. 

Outlook 
 While it is difficult to predict future North American economic activity and its impact on the demand for our galvanizing and coil coating solutions, as well the impact that political or regulatory developments may have on us, several factors are outlined below that may impact our results of operations during the third quarter of fiscal 2025.

 Sales prices in our AZZ Precoat Metals segment are expected to remain consistent with current levels, although fluctuations in mix may impact the average selling price. 
 Demand in our AZZ Metal Coatings and AZZ Precoat Metals segments is expected to follow our typical seasonal patterns. 
 Customer inventories for our AZZ Metal Coatings segment remain consistent, which should support the continued demand for our metal coatings solutions.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Overview 
 We are a provider of hot-dip galvanizing and coil coating solutions to a broad range of end-markets, predominantly in North America. We operate three distinct business segments, the AZZ Metal Coatings segment, the AZZ Precoat Metals segment, and the AZZ Infrastructure Solutions segment. Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is divided by each of our segments, along with corporate costs and other costs not specifically identifiable to a segment. For a reconciliation of segment operating income to consolidated operating income, see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. Management believes that the most meaningful analysis of our results of operations is to analyze our performance by segment. We use sales and operating income by segment to evaluate the performance of our segments. Segment operating income consists of sales less cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses that are specifically identifiable to a segment.

 Sales 
 For the three months ended August 31, 2024 (the "current quarter"), consolidated sales increased 10.5 million, or 2.6 , compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023 (the "prior year quarter"). Sales for the AZZ Metal Coatings

Table of Contents 

 segment increased 1.7 million, or 1.0 , for the current quarter, compared to the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily due to an increase of 1.6 million resulting from a higher volume of steel processed and an increase of 1.0 million due to an increase in selling price, partially offset by a decrease in other sales of 1.1 million. 
 Sales for the AZZ Precoat Metals segment increased 8.8 million, or 3.8 for the current quarter. The increase is due to a higher volume of coil coated in the current quarter, compared to the prior year quarter, while the average price decreased slightly due to product mix. 
 Operating Income 
 For the current quarter, consolidated operating income was 67.6 million, an increase of 6.6 million, or 10.9 , compared to the prior year quarter. 
 Operating income for the AZZ Metal Coatings segment increased 2.6 million, or 5.8 , for the current quarter, compared to the prior year quarter. The increase was due to increased sales as described above, coupled with lower cost of sales. The decrease in cost of sales of 1.3 million was primarily due to a 3.9 million decrease in zinc cost, partially offset by a 2.7 million increase in overhead costs and a 0.2 million increase in labor costs. 
 
 Operating income for the AZZ Precoat Metals segment increased 3.5 million, or 9.0 for the current quarter. The increase is primarily due to increased sales as described above, offset by higher cost of sales. Cost of sales increased 5.5 million, primarily due to variable costs related to the increased volume of steel processed, partially offset by a decrease of 0.2 million in selling, general and administrative expense. 
 Operating income for the AZZ Infrastructure Solutions segment increased 5.9 million, due to a legal settlement of 5.75 million and legal expenses associated with the settlement in the prior year six-month period. 
 Corporate Expenses 
 Corporate selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5.4 million, or 31.6 , for the current quarter, compared to the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation related to the Company's employee stock purchase plan, due to the increase in AZZ's common stock price. In addition, salaries and wages increased due to retirement and other severance expense for certain executive management employees and transition services agreement fees associated with the AVAIL JV, which were received in the prior year quarter, with no comparable receipt in the current quarter. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense for the current quarter decreased 5.9 million, to 21.9 million, compared to 27.8 million for the prior year quarter. The decrease in interest expense is primarily attributable to a decrease in the weighted average debt outstanding of 99.4 million and a decrease in the weighted average interest rate of 1.03 in the current quarter compared to the prior year quarter, coupled with higher capitalized interest of 1.2 million associated with the construction of the new plant in Washington, Missouri. 
 Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Entities 
 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries for the current quarter increased 0.5 million, to 1.5 million, compared to 1.0 million in the prior year quarter. The increase is due to higher earnings from the AVAIL JV, primarily driven by AVAIL's enclosure business. 
 See Note 7 of our consolidated financial statements for more information about the AVAIL JV. 
 Income Taxes 
 The provision for income taxes reflects an effective tax rate of for the three months ended August 31, 2024, compared to 17.4 for the three months ended August 31, 2023. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily attributable to favorable adjustments in the prior year related to uncertain tax positions .

 Sales 
 For the current six-month period, consolidated sales increased 32.8 million, or 4.2 , compared to the six months ended August 31, 2023 (the "prior year six-month period"). 
 Sales for the AZZ Metal Coatings segment increased 9.5 million, or 2.8 , for the current six-month period, compared to the prior year six-month period. The increase in sales was primarily due to an increase of 13.2 million resulting 
 34 

Table of Contents 

 from a higher volume of steel processed during the period and an increase of 1.9 million due to an increase in selling price, partially offset by a decrease in other sales of 2.3 million. 
 Sales for the AZZ Precoat Metals segment increased 23.3 million, or 5.2 for the current six-month period, primarily due to a higher volume of coil coated, partially offset by a decrease in selling price. 
 Operating Income 
 For the current six-month period, consolidated operating income increased 10.9 million, or 8.6 , to 137.4 million, compared to the prior year six-month period. 
 Operating income for the AZZ Metal Coatings segment increased 5.1 million, or 5.6 for the current six-month period, compared to the prior year six-month period. The increase was due to improved sales as described above, partially offset by higher cost of sales and higher selling, general and administrative expenses. Cost of sales increased 3.6 million, prim arily due to higher labor and overhead costs, partially offset by a decrease in zinc costs. Selling, general and administrative expense increased primarily due to an increase in compensation costs. 
 Operating income for the AZZ Precoat Metals segment increased 5.9 million, or 7.7 . The increase is primarily due to the increase in sales as described above, offset by higher cost of sales. Cost of sales increased 17.2 million, prima rily due to variable costs related to the increased volume of steel processed. 
 Operating income for the AZZ Infrastructure Solutions segment increased 5.9 million, primarily due to a legal settlement of 5.75 million and legal expenses associated with the settlement in the prior year six-month period. 
 Corporate Expenses 
 Corporate selling, general and administrative expenses increased 6.0 million, or 17.3 , for the current six-month period, compared to the prior year six-month period. The increase was primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation related to the Company's employee stock purchase plan, due to the increase in AZZ's common stock price. In addition, salaries and wages increased due to the retirement and other severance expense for certain executive management employees and transition services agreement fees associated with the AVAIL JV, which were received in the prior year six-month period, with no comparable receipt in the current six-month period. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense for the current six-month period decreased 11.8 million, to 44.7 million, compared to 56.5 million for the prior year six-month period. The decrease in interest expense is primarily attributable to a decrease in the weighted average debt outstanding of 108.5 million and a decrease in the weighted average interest rate of 0.92 in the current six-month period compared to the prior year six-month period, coupled with higher capitalized interest of 2.4 million associated with the construction of the new plant in Washington, MO. 
 Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Entities 
 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries for the current six-month period increased 2.9 million, to 5.3 million, compared to 2.4 million in the prior year six-month period. The increase is due to higher earnings from the AVAIL JV, primarily driven by AVAIL's enclosure business. 
 See Note 7 of our consolidated financial statements for more information about the AVAIL JV. 
 Income Taxes 
 The provision for income taxes reflects an effective tax rate of 23.9 for the current six-month period, compared to 21.5 for the prior year six-month period. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily attributable to favorable adjustments for the prior year six-month period related to uncertain tax positions, partially offset by higher discrete items driven by tax deductions for stock compensation in fiscal year 2025.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 We have historically met our cash needs through a combination of cash flows from operating activities along with equity from capital markets and from bank and bond market debt. Our cash requirements generally include quarterly cash dividend payments, capital improvements and debt repayment. We believe that our cash position, cash flows from operating activities, access to capital markets and our expectation of continuing availability to draw upon our credit facilities are sufficient to meet our cash flow needs for the foreseeable future. 
 As of August 31, 2024, our total liquidity of 312.9 million consisted of available capacity on our Revolving Credit Facility of 310.7 million and cash and cash equivalents of 2.2 million. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows by category for the periods presented (in thousands): 
 Six Months Ended August 31, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 119,430 118,341 Net cash used in investing activities (58,740) (42,706) Net cash used in financing activities (62,750) (76,380) 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the current six-month period was 119.4 million, driven primarily by net income from continuing operations of 75.0 million, adjusted to exclude non-cash charges, net of non-cash income of 48.6 million, an increase in cash resulting from a reduction in working capital of 8.5 million, a decrease in cash resulting from changes in other long-term assets and liabilities, including deferred taxes, of 0.9 million and a cash distribution received on the investment in the AVAIL JV of 5.2 million. The increase in working capital is due primarily to increases in accounts payable, other accrued liabilities and income taxes payable, as well as a reduction in inventories; partially offset by increases in accounts receivable, other receivables, prepaid expenses and contract assets due to higher sales. Net cash provided by operating activities was used to fund 59.5 million of capital expenditures, make net payments on long-term debt and finance leases liabilities of 45.4 million, make dividend payments of 12.9 million and make payments for taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards of 5.0 million. We also completed a secondary public offering of 4.6 million shares of our common stock, which provided cash, net of offering costs, of 310.2 million, which was used to redeem our 240,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock for 308.9 million. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the prior year six-month period was 118.3 million, driven primarily by net income of 56.9 million, adjusted to exclude non-cash charges, net of non-cash income of 46.4 million and an increase in cash resulting from an decrease in working capital of 21.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in cash resulting from other long-term assets and liabilities, including deferred taxes, of 6.3 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was used to fund 42.7 million of capital expenditures, make net payments on long-term debt and finance leases liabilities of 60.2 million, make dividend payments of 15.7 million and make payments for taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards of 0.8 million. 
 Financing and Capital 
 2022 Credit Agreement and Term Loan B 
 We have a credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions that was entered into on May 13, 2022, and was subsequently amended on August 17, 2023, December 20, 2023 and March 20, 2024 (collectively referred to herein as the "2022 Credit Agreement"). See below for information related to the repricing of the Company's Term Loan B on September 24, 2024. 
 The 2022 Credit Agreement includes the following significant terms: 
 i. provides for a senior secured initial term loan in the aggregate principal amount of 1.3 billion (the "Term Loan B"), due May 13, 2029, which is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company; as of August 31, 2024, the outstanding balance of the Term Loan B was 890.3 million; 
 ii. provides for a maximum senior secured Revolving Credit Facility in the aggregate principal amount of 400.0 million (the "Revolving Credit Facility"), which matures on May 13, 2027; 
 36 

Table of Contents 

 iii. includes a letter of credit sub-facility of up to 100.0 million, which is part of, and not in addition to, the Revolving Credit Facility; 
 iv. borrowings under the Term Loan B bear a tiered interest rate of Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") plus 3.25 , which is part of, and not in addition to, the Revolving Credit Facility; 
 v. borrowings under the Term Loan B bear a tiered interest rate of Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") plus 3.25 (following the repricing on March 20, 2024 as described below) and the Revolving Credit Facility bears a leverage-based rate with various tiers between 2.75 and 3.50 ; as of August 31, 2024, the interest rate was SOFR plus 2.75 ; 
 vi. includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default; including restrictions on the incurrence of non-ordinary course debt, investment and dividends, subject to various exceptions; and, 
 vii. includes a maximum quarterly leverage ratio financial covenant, with reporting requirements to our banking group at each quarter-end. 
 
 On March 20, 2024, we entered the term loan market and repriced our existing Term Loan B. The repricing reduced the Term Loan B spread from a rate of SOFR plus 3.75 to SOFR plus 3.25 . 
 On September 24, 2024, we completed our third repricing of the Term Loan B, for which 890.3 million was outstanding as of August 31, 2024 . The repricing reduced the margin from SOFR plus 3.25 to SOFR plus 2.50 , for a total reduction of 75 basis points. 
 
 We primarily utilize proceeds from the Revolving Credit Facility to finance working capital needs, capital improvements, quarterly cash dividends, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes. 
 As defined in the 2022 Credit Agreement, quarterly prepayments were due against the outstanding principal of the Term Loan B and were payable on the last business day of each May, August, November and February, beginning August 31, 2022, in a quarterly aggregate principal amount of 3.25 million, with the entire remaining principal amount due on May 13, 2029, the maturity date. Additional prepayments made against the Term Loan B contribute to these required quarterly payments. Due to prepayments made against the Term Loan B since August 31, 2022, the quarterly mandatory principal payment requirement has been met, and the quarterly payments of 3.25 million are no longer required. 
 The weighted average interest rate for our outstanding debt, including the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan B, was 8.03 and 8.56 for the six months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Debt Compliance and Outstanding Borrowings 
 Our 2022 Credit Agreement requires us to maintain a maximum Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the loan agreement) no greater than 4.5. As of August 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants and other requirements set forth in the 2022 Credit Agreement. 
 As of August 31, 2024, we had 965.3 million of debt outstanding on the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan B, with varying maturities through fiscal 2029. We had approximately 310.7 million of additional credit available as of August 31, 2024. 
 Letters of Credit 
 As of August 31, 2024, we had total outstanding letters of credit in the amount of 14.3 million. These letters of credit are most commonly issued in lieu of customer retention withholding payments covering warranty, performance periods and insurance collateral. 
 Interest Rate Swap 
 We manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on our floating-rate debt by entering into interest rate swap agreements to convert a portion of our variable-rate debt to a fixed rate. On September 27, 2022, we entered into a fixed-rate interest rate swap agreement, which was subsequently amended on October 7, 2022 (the "2022 Swap"), with banks that are parties to the 2022 Credit Agreement, to change the SOFR-based component of the interest rate. The 2022 Swap converts the SOFR portion to 4.277 . On March 20, 2024, we repriced our Term Loan B to SOFR plus 3.25 , resulting in a total fixed rate of 7.527 . See " 2022 Credit Agreement and Term Loan B" section above for information related to the repricing of the Company's Term Loan B on September 24, 2024. Th e 2022 Swap had an initial notional amount of 550.0 million and a maturity date of September 30, 2025. The notional amount of the interest rate swap decreases by a pro-rata portion of any 
 37 

Table of Contents 

 quarterly principal payments made on the Term Loan B, and the current notional amount is 539.0 million as of August 31, 2024. The objective of the 2022 Swap is to eliminate the variability of cash flows in interest payments attributable to changes in benchmark one-month SOFR interest rates, for a portion of our variable-rate debt. The hedged risk is the interest rate risk exposure to changes in interest payments, attributable to changes in benchmark one-month SOFR interest rates over the interest rate swap term. The changes in cash flows of the 2022 Swap exactly offset changes in cash flows of the variable-rate debt. We designated the 2022 Swap as a cash flow hedge at inception. Cash payments or receipts to settle the 2022 Swap are recognized in interest expense. 
 April 2024 Secondary Public Offering 
 On April 30, 2024, we completed a secondary public offering in which we sold 4.6 million shares of our common stock at 70.00 per share (the "April 2024 Secondary Public Offering"). We received gross proceeds of 322.0 million, and paid offering expenses of 13.3 million, for net proceeds of 308.7 million. The proceeds from the April 2024 Offering were used to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock. 
 Series A Convertible Preferred Stock 
 On May 9, 2024, we fully redeemed our 240,000 shares of 6.0 Series A Convertible Preferred Stock ("Series A Preferred Stock") for 308.9 million. The payment was calculated as the face value of the Series A Preferred Stock of 240.0 million, multiplied by the Return Factor (as defined below) of 1.4, less dividends paid to date of 27.1 million. The redemption premium of 75.2 million, which was calculated as the difference between the redemption amount and the book value of 233.7 million, was recorded as a deemed dividend, and reduces net income available to common shareholders. The Series A Preferred Stock was redeemed using proceeds from the April 2024 Secondary Public Offering. 
 On August 5, 2022, we exchanged our 240.0 million 6.00 convertible subordinated notes due June 30, 2030 for 240,000 shares of 6.0 Series A Preferred Stock, following the receipt of shareholder approval for the issuance of Series A Preferred Stock. The Series A Preferred Stock had a 1.00 par value per share, and ranked senior to the common stock of the Company, including with respect to both income and capital, but junior to our indebtedness. The Series A Preferred Stock is classified as "Mezzanine equity" in the consolidated balance sheets and, as noted above, was fully redeemed on May 9, 2024. 
 Greenfield Aluminum Coil Coating Facility 
 We are expanding our coatings capabilities by constructing a new 25-acre aluminum coil coating facility in Washington, Missouri that is expected to be operational in calendar year 2025 (the Company's fiscal year 2026). The new greenfield facility will be included in the AZZ Precoat Metals segment and is supported by a take-or-pay contract for approximately 75 of the output from the new plant. We expect to spend approximately 124.0 million in capital payments over the life of the project, of which 60.8 million was paid prior to fiscal 2025 and 35.6 million was paid during the six months ended August 31, 2024 . The remaining balance of 27.6 million is to occur prior to the end of fiscal 2025, of which we have capital commitments of 17.4 million. The remaining payments in fiscal 2025 are expected to be funded through cash flows from operations. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 During the six months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, we did not repurchase shares of common stock under the 2020 Share Authorization. As of August 31, 2024, we had 53.2 million available under the 2020 Share Authorization that may be used to purchase shares in the future. See Part II, Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 Other Exposures 
 We have exposure to commodity price increases in all three of our operating segments, primarily zinc and natural gas in the AZZ Metal Coatings segment, and natural gas, steel and aluminum in the AZZ Precoat Metals segment. We attempt to minimize these increases by entering into agreements with our zinc suppliers and such agreements generally include fixed premiums, and by entering into agreements with our natural gas suppliers to fix a portion of our purchase cost. In addition to these measures, we attempt to recover other cost increases through improvements to our manufacturing process, supply chain management, and through increases in prices to match inflationary increases where competitively feasible. We have indirect exposure to copper, aluminum, steel and nickel-based alloys in the AZZ Infrastructure Solutions segment through our 40 investment in the AVAIL JV. 
 As of August 31, 2024 , we had non-cancelable forward contracts to purchase approximately 37.9 million of zinc at various volumes and prices between March 2024 and December 2024. We also had non-cancelable forward contracts to purchase approximately 9.3 million] of natural gas at various volumes and prices between June 2024 and August 2025. All such contracts expire by the first quarter of fiscal 2026. We had no other contracted commitments for any other commodities 
 38 

Table of Contents 

 including steel, aluminum, copper, zinc, nickel-based alloys, natural gas, except for those entered into under the normal course of business. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations 
 As of August 31, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined under SEC rules. Specifically, there were no off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations (including contingent obligations), or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that have, or may have, a material effect on the financial condition, changes in financial condition, sales or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources of the Company.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 Gainesville Associates LLC v. Atlantic Research LLC et al (a legacy entity lawsuit that arose out of the Precoat acquisition, which is unrelated to our current operations or operating entities). 
 On July 29, 2024, Gainesville Associates, LLC Gainesville Associates filed a complaint (the Complaint in the Circuit Court of Prince William County, Virginia against AZZ, Atlantic Research, LLC ARC ), Precoat Metals Corporation, and Chromalloy Corporation (collectively Defendants ), asserting claims for breach of contract against ARC and unjust enrichment against all Defendants. The Complaint arises out of a lease, dated January 1, 1976, between Gainesville Associates as landlord and ARC as tenant (as subsequently amended in 1982, 2012, 2013 and 2017, the Lease for property in Gainesville, Virginia (the Property ). ARC ceased using the property in 2005 after which point ARC remained in the Lease to complete its obligations on the property pursuant to a consent decree entered into between the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPA and ARC in 1992. ARC satisfied its obligations under the consent decree in 2018 (other than ongoing well water monitoring and testing) and terminated the Lease in 2019. In its Complaint, Gainesville Associates alleges that ARC breached certain provisions of the Lease. On September 3, 2024, Defendants removed the action to the United States District Court of the Eastern District of Virginia. On September 24, 2024, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Complaint in its entirety, arguing that the complaint failed to adequately allege any claim against any Defendant. Plaintiff has not yet filed its 
 39 

Table of Contents 

 response to the Defendant s motion to dismiss. Management believes there is no merit to Plaintiff s allegations and will continue to aggressively pursue dismissal of the action. 
 In addition to the foregoing, the Company and its subsidiaries are named defendants and plaintiffs in various routine lawsuits incidental to our business. These proceedings include labor and employment claims, various commercial disputes, worker s compensation and environmental matters, all arising in the normal course of business. As discovery progresses on all outstanding legal matters, the Company continues to evaluate opportunities to either mediate the case or settle the disputes for nuisance value or the cost of defense as a way to resolve the disputes prior to trial. As the pending cases progress through additional discovery and potential mediation, our assessment of the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome on the pending lawsuits may change. Although the outcome of these lawsuits or other proceedings cannot be predicted with any certainty, and the amount of any potential liability that could arise with respect to such lawsuits or other matters cannot be predicted at this time, management, after consultation with legal counsel believes it has strong defenses to all of its legal matters and does not expect liabilities, if any, from these claims or proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. For further discussion of the Company's legal proceedings, see Note 16 to the financial statements contained herein under Part 1. Item 1. Financial Statements. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 There are numerous factors that affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, many of which are beyond our control. In addition to other information set forth in this Quarterly Report, careful consideration should be given to Item 1A. Risk Factors in Part I and Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II of our Annual Report, which contain descriptions of significant factors that might cause the actual results of operations in future periods to differ materially from those currently projected in the forward-looking statements contained therein. 
 There have been no material changes from risk factors previously disclosed in the Company s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. See the discussion of the Company s risk factors under Part I, Item 1A. in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2024.

Repurchases under the 2020 Share Authorization will be made through open market and/or private transactions, in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, and could include repurchases pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, which allows stock repurchases when the Company might otherwise be precluded from doing so. 
 The Company did not purchase any shares of common stock under the 2020 Share Authorization during the six months ended August 31, 2024. As of August 31, 2024, we had 53.2 million remaining under the 2020 Share Authorization that may be used to repurchase outstanding shares of common stock in the future.
