GENERATION INCOME PROPERTIES, INC. 
 NOTES TO UNAUDITED CON SOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 . The Company is an internally managed real estate investment company focused on acquiring and managing income-producing retail, office and industrial properties net leased to high quality tenants in major markets throughout the United States. The Company formed Generation Income Properties L.P. (the Operating Partnership in . Substantially all of the Company s assets are held by, and operations are conducted through, the Operating Partnership or its direct or indirect subsidiaries. The Company is the general partner of the Operating Partnership and as of September 30, 2024 owned of the outstanding common units of the Operating Partnership. The Company formed a Maryland entity GIP REIT OP Limited LLC in 2018 that owns of the Operating Partnership. The Company places each property in a separate entity which may have a Redeemable Non-Controlling interest as a member. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company, the Operating Partnership, and their controlled subsidiaries on a consolidated basis owned properties. Management s Liquidity Plans and Going Concern On August 27, 2014, FASB issued ASU 2014-05, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which requires management to assess a company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from financial statement issuance and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. In accordance with ASU 2014-05, management s analysis can only include the potential mitigating impact of management s plans that have not been fully implemented as of the issuance date if (a) it is probable that management s plans will be effectively implemented on a timely basis, and (b) it is probable that the plans, when implemented, will alleviate the relevant conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP applicable to a going concern. This presentation contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business and does not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of the uncertainties described below. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company generated positive operating cash flows of and had cash on hand of million as of September 30, 2024. As a result of our recurring losses, our projected cash needs, and our current liquidity, substantial doubt exists about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern one year after the date that these financial statements are issued. In August 2024 the Company modified terms for two secured mortgage loans set to expire in September 2024 and October 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the principal balances of the modified secured loans were million and million at annual interest with maturity dates extended to August 2029. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon continued successful execution of management s plan to improve the Company s liquidity and profitability.

and of prepaid rent as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company reviews the collectability of charges under its tenant operating leases on a regular basis, taking into consideration changes in factors such as the tenant s payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates, and economic conditions in the area where the property is located. In the event that uncollectibility exists with respect to any tenant changes, the Company would record an allowance with a corresponding reduction to Rental income. The Company s review of collectability of charges under its operating leases includes any accrued rental revenues related to the straight-line rents. There were no allowances for receivables recorded during three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. The Company s leases provide for reimbursement from tenants for common area maintenance CAM ), insurance, real estate taxes and other operating expenses recoverable costs ). A portion of our operating cost reimbursement revenue is estimated each period and is recognized as rental income in the period the recoverable costs are incurred and accrued. The Company often recognizes above- and below-market lease intangibles in connection with acquisitions of real estate. The capitalized above- and below-market lease intangibles are amortized to rental income over the remaining term of the related leases.

There were impairments in the Company's investments in real estate during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The valuation of impaired assets is determined using valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis, analysis of recent comparable sales transactions, and purchase offers received from third parties, which are Level 3 inputs. The Company may consider a single valuation technique or multiple valuation techniques, as appropriate, when estimating the fair value of its real estate. Estimating future cash flows is highly subjective and estimates can differ materially from actual results.

Our CEO entered into a guarantee agreement pursuant to which he guaranteed the payment obligations under the promissory notes if they become due as a result of certain bad-boy provisions, individually and on behalf of the Operating Partnership. 
 On August 10, 2023, GIP13, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of GIP SPE ("GIP Borrower"), entered into a Loan Agreement with Valley pursuant to which Valley made a loan to the Company in the amount of 21.0 million to finance the acquisition of the Modiv Portfolio. The outstanding principal amount of the loan bears interest at an annual rate for each 30-day interest period equal to the compounded average of the secured overnight financing rate published by Federal Reserve Bank of New York for the thirty-day period prior to the last day of each 30-day interest rate for the applicable interest rate period plus 3.25 , with interest payable monthly after each 30-day interest period. However, the Company entered into an interest rate swap to fix the interest rate at 7.47 per annum. Payments of interest and principal in the amount of approximately 156,000 are due and payable monthly, with all remaining principal and accrued but unpaid interest due and payable on a maturity date of August 10, 2028. The loan may generally be prepaid at any time without penalty in whole or in part, provided that there is no return of loan fees and prepaid financing fees. The loan is secured by first mortgages and assignments of rents in the properties comprising the Modiv Portfolio and eight other properties held by subsidiaries of GIP SPE that had outstanding loans with Valley. All of the mortgaged properties cross collateralize the loan, and the loan is guaranteed by the Operating Partnership and the subsidiaries of the Company that hold the properties that comprise the Modiv Portfolio. The loan agreement also provides for customary events of default and other customary affirmative and negative covenants that are applicable to GIP Borrower and its subsidiaries, including reporting covenants and restrictions on investments, additional indebtedness, liens, sales of properties, certain mergers, and certain management changes. The Company's President and CEO also entered into a personal, full recourse guarantee with a 7,500,000 cap. 
 
 On June 27, 2024, the Operating Partnership and an accredited investor entered into a Unit Purchase Agreement (the June 2024 Unit Purchase Agreement pursuant to which the Operating Partnership issued and sold to the investor 500,000 Series A Preferred Units at a price of 5.00 per unit for an aggregate purchase price of two million five hundred thousand dollars 2,500,000) in cash. Under the terms of the Series A Preferred Units, the investor will be paid cumulative cash distributions in the amount of 0.325 per Series A Preferred Unit per year, payable monthly in arrears, on or about the 15th day of each month. Each of the investor and the Operating Partnership will have the right to cause the Operating Partnership to redeem the Series A Preferred Units after two (2) years for cash in an amount equal to 5.15 per Series A Preferred Unit plus any accrued but unpaid Series A Preferred Return, provided that the Operating Partnership may (with the prior written consent of the investor) cause the redemption price to be satisfied by the issuance of a number of shares of common stock of the Company equal to the number of Series A Preferred Units being redeemed multiplied by 1.03 plus any accrued but unpaid Series A Preferred Return. If the Operating Partnership fails to declare and pay the Series A Preferred Return for a period of three consecutive months, the investor may exercise the foregoing redemption right within the 30-day period following such failure. 
 Our President and CEO has also personally guaranteed the repayment of the 10.6 million due under the 7-11 - Washington, DC; Starbucks - South Tampa, FL; and vacant - Huntsville, AL loan as well as the 1.3 million loan secured by the Company's Sherwin-Williams - Tampa, FL property. In addition, our President and CEO has also provided a guaranty of the Company s nonrecourse carveout liabilities and obligations in favor of the lender for the GSA and PRA Holdings, Inc. - Norfolk, VA mortgage loans ("Bayport loans") with an aggregate principal amount of 11.6 million. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a guaranty fee expense to our President and CEO of 102,023 and 304,245, respectively, recorded to interest expense. A guaranty fee expense of 81,022 and 196,304 was incurred during the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 
 On August 9, 2022, we entered a Redemption Agreement with a unit holder. As such, we recorded another payable - related party in the amount of 2,912,300 upon execution of the Redemption Agreement entered into July 20, 2022 and has since made installment payments of 2,007,380 to date with a remaining balance of 904,920 outstanding as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 On October 14, 2022, we entered into a loan transaction that is evidenced by a secured non-convertible promissory note to Brown Family Enterprises, LLC, a preferred equity partner and therefore a related party, for 1.5 million that is due on October 14, 2024, and bears a fixed interest rate of 9 with simple interest payable monthly. On July 21, 2023, the Company amended and restated the promissory note to reflect an increase in the loan to 5.5 million and extend the maturity date thereof from October 14, 2024 to October 14, 2026. Except for the increase in the amount of the Loan and Note and the extension of the maturity date thereof, no changes were made to the original note. The loan may be repaid without penalty at any time. The loan is secured by the Operating Partnership s equity interest in its current direct subsidiaries that hold real estate assets pursuant to the terms of a security agreement between the Operating Partnership and Brown Family Enterprises, LLC. 
 
 34 

We currently obtain the capital required to primarily invest in and manage a diversified portfolio of commercial net lease real estate investments and conduct our operations from the proceeds of equity offerings, debt financings, preferred minority interest obtained from third parties, issuance of Operating Partnership units and from any undistributed funds from our operations. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company generated positive operating cash flows of 783,511 and had cash on hand of 1.58 million as of September 30, 2024. As a result of our recurring losses, our projected cash needs, and our current liquidity, substantial doubt exists about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern one year after the date that these financial statements are issued. In August 2024 the Company modified terms for two secured mortgage loans set to expire in September 2024 and October 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the principal balances of the modified secured loans were 7.2 million and 4.4 million at 6.15 annual interest with maturity dates extended to August 2029. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon continued successful execution of management s plan to improve the Company s liquidity and profitability.

On February 8, 2023, we entered into new Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreements for the Norfolk, Virginia properties, GIPVA 2510 Walmer Ave, LLC ("GIPVA 2510") and GIPVA 130 Corporate Blvd, LLC ("GIPVA 130"), in which we, as the sole member of GIPVA 2510 and GIPVA 130, admitted a new preferred member, Brown Family Enterprises, LLC, through the issuance of preferred membership interests in the form of Class A Preferred Units of GIPVA 2510 and GIPVA 130. GIPVA 2510 and GIPVA 130 (the Virginia SPEs hold our Norfolk, Virginia properties. In addition, both of the Virginia SPEs and Brown Family Enterprises, LLC entered into Unit Purchase Agreements in which GIPVA 2510 issued and sold 180,000 Class A Preferred Units at a price of 10.00 per unit for an aggregate price of 1,800,000, and GIPVA 130 issued and sold 120,000 Class A Preferred Units at a price of 10.00 per unit for an aggregate price of 1,200,000. The Operating Partnership is the general manager of the subsidiary while Brown Family Enterprises, LLC is a preferred equity member. Pursuant to the agreement, we are required to pay the preferred equity member a 7 IRR paid on a monthly basis and will share in 16 of the equity in each of the Virginia SPEs upon a capital transaction resulting in distributable proceeds. After 24 months, Brown Family Enterprises, LLC has the right to redeem the preferred equity at redemption value. On July 25, 2024, we entered into First Amendments to the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreements, dated as of February 8, 2023, for each of these entities revising the redemption date from February 8, 2025 to February 8, 2027. Because of the redemption right, the non-controlling interest is presented as temporary equity at an aggregated redemption value of 3,000,000 as of September 30, 2024. 
 In connection with the acquisition of the Modiv Portfolio, the Operating Partnership and LC2 entered into an Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement for GIP SPE (the GIP SPE Operating Agreement pursuant to which LC2 made a 12.0 million initial capital contribution to GIP SPE, together with a commitment to make an additional 2.1 million contribution upon the satisfactory completion of the acquisition of a tenant-in-common interest held by a third party in the Company s Rockford, Illinois property (the LC2 Investment ). The Company completed the acquisition of such tenant-in-common interest on September 7, 2023, for a purchase price of 1.3 million and LC2 made the additional 2.1 million capital contribution on September 11, 2023. LC2 made the LC2 Investment in exchange for a preferred equity interest in GIP SPE (the Preferred Interest ). The Preferred Interest has a cumulative accruing distribution preference of 15.5 per year, compounded monthly, a portion of which in the amount of 5 per annum (compounded monthly) is deemed to be the current preferred return, and the remainder of which in the amount of 10.5 per annum (compounded monthly) is deemed to be the accrued preferred return. The GIP SPE operating agreement provides that operating distributions by GIP SPE will be made first to LC2 to satisfy any accrued but unpaid current preferred return, with the balance being paid to the Operating Partnership, unless the annualized debt yield of GIP SPE is less than 10 , in which case the balance will be paid to LC2. For this purpose, annualized debt yield is calculated as the sum of senior debt and LC2 Investment divided by the trailing three-month annualized adjusted net operating income (as defined in the GIP SPE Operating Agreement) of GIP SPE. The GIP SPE Operating Agreement also provides that distributions from capital transactions will be paid first to LC2 to satisfy any accrued but unpaid preferred return, then to LC2 until the Make-Whole Amount (defined as the amount equal to 1.3 times the LC2 Investment) is reduced to zero, and then to the Operating Partnership. 
 The Preferred Interest is required to be redeemed in full by the Company on or before August 10, 2025 for a redemption amount equal to the greater of (i) the amount of the LC2 Investment plus the accrued preferred return, and (ii) the Make-Whole Amount. Upon a 
 37 

failure to timely redeem the Preferred Interest, the preferred return will accrue at an increased rate of 18 per annum, compounded monthly. The Company will have the right to extend the Mandatory Redemption Date for two consecutive 12-month extension periods, provided that (i) LC2 is paid an extension fee of 0.01 of the outstanding amount of the LC2 Investment for each such extension, (ii) the preferred return is increased from 15.5 to 18 of which the accrued preferred return is increased from 10.5 to 13 , (iii) the trailing 6-month annualized adjusted net operating income (as defined in the GIP SPE Operating Agreement) is in excess of 5.0 million, (iv) GIP SPE and its subsidiaries senior debt is extended through the end of the extension period, and there are no defaults under the GIP SPE Operating Agreement. 
 Under the GIP SPE Operating Agreement, GIP SPE is also required to pay to Loci Capital, an affiliate of LC2, an equity fee of 1.5 of the LC2 Investment, with 1 having been paid upon the execution and delivery of the GIP SPE Operating Agreement and the 0.5 payable upon redemption of the LC2 Investment. 
 Due to the redemption right, the Preferred Interest is presented as temporary equity at redemption value of 14,100,000 plus accrued but unpaid preferred interest of 2,280,471 as of September 30, 2024. 
 Each of the preferred members described above may redeem their interest on or after the Redemption date (second year anniversary of the closing of the acquisition), at the discretion of such preferred member, as applicable, all or a portion thereof, of such preferred member s pro-rata share of the redemption value in the form of the units of the Operating Partnership ("GIP LP Units"). Such GIP LP Units shall be subject to all such restrictions, such as with respect to transferability, as reasonably imposed by the Operating Partnership. The number of GIP LP Units issued to any preferred member shall be determined by dividing the total amount of the redemption value that such preferred member shall receive in GIP LP Units by a 15 discount of the average 30-day market price of Generation Income Properties, Inc. common stock. GIP LP Units shall then be convertible into common stock of Generation Income Properties, Inc. on a 1:1 basis in accordance with the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership. Additionally, the Operating Partnership has the right to redeem the preferred equity at redemption value with cash after the second year anniversary of the closing of the acquisition. 
 The primary objective of our financing strategy is to maintain financial flexibility using retained cash flows, long-term debt and common and perpetual preferred stock to finance our growth. We intend to have a lower-leveraged portfolio over the long-term after we have acquired an initial substantial portfolio of diversified investments. During the period when we are acquiring our current portfolio, we will employ greater leverage on individual assets (that will also result in greater leverage of the current portfolio) in order to quickly build a diversified portfolio of assets. 

Cash from Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 783,511 and net cash provided by operating activities was 18,537 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change is due to the doubling of the number of the Company's income generating assets through the 13 property Modiv acquisition. 
 Cash from Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 5,960,893. Net cash used in investing activities was 33,314,973 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to an escrow deposit for a property purchase. 
 Cash from Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 3,607,045 and 33,916,112 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change is due to several factors comprising the increase of mortgage principal repayments driven by the Modiv acquisition in August 2023, the increase in distributions to non-controlling interests, and dividend payments on both preferred and common stock. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 We do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 38 

Our reported results are presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). We also disclose funds from operations ("FFO"), adjusted funds from operations ("AFFO"), core funds from operations ("Core FFO") and core adjusted funds of operations ("Core AFFO") all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they are widely accepted industry measures used by analysts and investors to compare the operating performance of REITs. 
 
 FFO and related measures do not represent cash generated from operating activities and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements; accordingly, they should not be considered alternatives to net income or loss as a performance measure or cash flows from operations as reported on our statement of cash flows as a liquidity measure and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures. 
 
 We compute FFO in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude, net gains from sales of property and adding back real estate depreciation; namely, excluding from net income depreciation and amortization related to real estate, gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control, and impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by an entity. We then adjust FFO for non-cash revenues and expenses such as amortization of deferred financing costs, above and below market lease intangible amortization, straight line rent adjustment where the Company is both the lessor and lessee, and non-cash stock compensation to calculate Core AFFO. 
 
 FFO is used by management, investors, and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers primarily because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. We believe that AFFO is an additional useful supplemental measure for investors to consider because it will help them to better assess our operating performance without the distortions created by other non-cash revenues or expenses. FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. We believe that Core FFO and Core AFFO are useful measures for management and investors because they further remove the effect of non-cash expenses and certain other expenses that are not directly related to real estate operations. We use each as measures of our performance when we formulate corporate goals. 
 
 As FFO excludes depreciation and amortization, gains and losses from property dispositions that are available for distribution to stockholders and non-recurring or extraordinary items, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses and interest costs, providing a perspective not immediately apparent from net income or loss. However, FFO should not be viewed as an alternative measure of our operating performance since it does not reflect either depreciation and amortization costs or the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties which could be significant economic costs and could materially impact our results from operations. Additionally, FFO does not reflect distributions paid to redeemable non-controlling interests.
