components - a base management fee and an incentive fee. The cost of both the base management fee and incentive fee is ultimately borne by the Company s stockholders. 
 Base Management Fee 
 The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of of the Company s average invested equity capital (as defined below) as of the end of the then-current quarter and the prior calendar quarter. For this purpose, invested equity capital means the amounts drawn on the Company s capital commitments from investors. 
 Following the closing of the listing of shares of the Company s common stock on a national securities exchange, including in connection with an initial public offering IPO ), the base management fee will be calculated at an annual rate of of the Company s average adjusted gross assets, including assets purchased with borrowed funds. The base management fee will be calculated based on the average value of the Company s gross assets at the end of its two most recently completed calendar quarters. 
 Incentive Fee 
 The incentive fee, which provides the Adviser with a share of the income that it generates for the Company, consists of components - investment income and capital gains - which are largely independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not payable. 
 Under the investment income component, the Company will pay the Adviser each quarter of the amount by which the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for the quarter exceeds a hurdle rate of (which is annualized) of its net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, subject to a catch-up provision pursuant to which the Adviser receives all of such income in excess of the level but less than . The effect of the catch-up provision is that if pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds in any calendar quarter, the Adviser receives of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income as if the hurdle rate did not apply. 
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital gains or losses. The investment income component of the incentive fee will be subject to a total return requirement, which will provide that no incentive fee in respect of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income will be payable except to the extent that of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations over the then current and 11 preceding quarters (the Trailing Twelve Quarters exceeds the cumulative incentive fees accrued and/or paid for the 11 preceding quarters. In other words, any investment income incentive fee that is payable in a calendar quarter is limited to the lesser of (i) of the amount by which the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for such calendar quarter exceeds the hurdle, subject to the catch-up provision and (ii) (x) of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the Trailing Twelve Quarters minus (y) the cumulative incentive fees accrued and/or paid for the 11 preceding calendar quarters. For the foregoing purpose, the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations is the sum of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income, realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation for the Trailing Twelve Quarters. However, following the occurrence (if any) of an IPO, the Trailing Twelve Quarters will be reset so as to include, as of the end of any quarter, the calendar quarter then ending and the 11 preceding calendar quarters (or if shorter, the number of quarters that have occurred since the IPO, rather than the number of quarters that have occurred since May 27, 2020). 
 The capital gains component of the incentive fee will be determined and paid annually in arrears at the end of each calendar year or, in the event of an Advanced Liquidity Event (as defined below), the date on which the closing of such Advanced Liquidity Event occurs. At the end of each calendar year (or upon the effectuation of an Advanced Liquidity Event), the Company will pay the Adviser (A) of the difference, if positive, of the sum of aggregate cumulative realized capital gains, if any, computed net of aggregate cumulative realized capital losses, if any, and aggregate cumulative unrealized capital depreciation, in each case from May 27, 2020, the initial effective date of the Advisory Agreement, through the end of such year (or the date on which an Advanced Liquidity Event occurs), less (B) the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fees from May 27, 2020 until the end of such calendar year (or the date on which an Advanced Liquidity Event occurs). For the foregoing purpose, aggregate cumulative realized capital gains does not include any unrealized capital appreciation. An Advanced Liquidity Event could include: (1) a listing of the Company s shares of capital stock on a national securities exchange, including through an IPO, (2) a merger with another entity, including an affiliated company, subject to any limitations under the 1940 Act or (3) the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company.

of such amount, minus the aggregate amount of the actual capital gains incentive fee paid in all prior periods. If such amount is negative, then there is no accrual for such period and previous accruals for capital gains incentive fees may be reversed. There can be no assurance that such unrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future. Additionally, if the Advisory Agreement is terminated as of a date that is not a calendar year end, including upon the effectuation of a merger of the Company with another entity (including an affiliated company, subject to any limitations under the 1940 Act) or the sale of all or substantially all of the Company s assets, the termination date is treated as though it were a calendar year end for purposes of calculating and paying the capital gains incentive fee. 
 Base management and incentive fees are paid in the quarter following that in which they are earned. 
 Income incentive fee Capital gains incentive fee 
 Administration Agreement 
 The Administration Agreement provides that the Administrator is responsible for furnishing the Company with office facilities and equipment and providing the Company with clerical, bookkeeping, recordkeeping services and other administrative services at such facilities. Under the Administration Agreement, the Administrator performs, or oversees, or arranges for, the performance of the Company s required administrative services, which includes being responsible for the financial and other records which the Company is required to maintain and preparing reports to the Company s stockholders and reports and other materials filed with the SEC and any other regulatory authority. In addition, the Administrator assists the Company in determining and publishing net asset value NAV ), overseeing the preparation and filing of the Company s tax returns and printing and disseminating reports and other materials to the Company s stockholders, and generally oversees the payment of the Company s expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to the Company by others. Under the Administration Agreement, the Administrator also provides significant managerial assistance on the Company s behalf to those companies that have accepted the Company s offer to provide such assistance. 
 In consideration of the provision of the services of the Administrator, the Company reimburses the Administrator for the costs and expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations and providing personnel and facilities under the Administration Agreement. Payments under the Administration Agreement are equal to the Company s allocable portion (subject to the review of the Board) of the Administrator s overhead resulting from its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and the allocable portion of the cost of the chief compliance officer and chief financial officer and their respective staffs. In addition, if requested to provide significant managerial assistance to the Company s portfolio companies, the Administrator is paid an additional amount based on the services provided, which shall not exceed the amount the Company receives from such companies for providing this assistance. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, expenses paid or payable by the Company to the Administrator under the Administration Agreement were million and million, respectively. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, expenses paid or payable by the Company to the Administrator under the Administrative Agreement were million and million, respectively.

of the total dollar value of the Company s investment portfolio will receive valuation recommendations from an independent third-party valuation firm each quarter, as selected in accordance with the Company s valuation policy. Each new portfolio investment will be reviewed by an independent third-party valuation firm within months of the date of investment, and thereafter will be reviewed by an independent third-party valuation firm no later than the fourth quarter following its most recent inclusion in such review process. However, a valuation review by an independent third-party valuation firm is not required for an investment whose total dollar value is less than of the total dollar value of the Company s aggregate investment portfolio (up to an aggregate of of the total dollar value of the Company s aggregate investment portfolio) or for those assets that the Board and/or Audit Committee has agreed to waive from such requirement. 
 The Adviser and the independent third-party valuation firms, if applicable, then present their proposed valuations to the Audit Committee and Board, and the Board makes a fair valuation determination for each portfolio investment that is to be fair valued. 
 Debt Investments 
 The debt investments identified on the consolidated schedules of investments are loans made to venture capital-backed companies focused in technology and other high growth industries which are backed by a select group of leading venture capital investors. These investments are considered Level 3 assets under ASC Topic 820 as there is no known or accessible market or market indices for these types of debt instruments and thus the Company must estimate the fair value of these investment securities based on models utilizing unobservable inputs. 
 To estimate the fair value of debt investments, the Company compares the cost basis of each debt investment, including any OID, to the resulting fair value determined using a discounted cash flow model, unless another model is more appropriate based on the circumstances at the measurement date. The discounted cash flow approach entails analyzing the interest rate spreads for recently completed financing transactions which are similar in nature to these debt investments, in order to determine a comparable range of effective market interest rates. The range of interest rate spreads utilized is based on borrowers with similar credit profiles. All remaining expected cash flows of the investment are discounted using this range of interest rates to determine a range of fair values for the debt investment. 
 The valuation process includes, among other things, evaluating the underlying investment performance of the portfolio company s current financial condition and ability to raise additional capital, as well as macro-economic events that may impact valuations. These events include, but are not limited to, current market yields and interest rate spreads of similar securities as of the measurement date. Changes in these unobservable inputs could result in significantly different fair value measurements. 
 Under certain circumstances, an alternative technique may be used to value certain debt investments that better reflect the fair value of the investment, such as the price paid or realized in a recently completed transaction or a binding offer received in an arm s length transaction, the use of multiple probability weighted cash flow models when the expected future cash flows contain elements of variability or estimates of proceeds that would be received in a liquidation scenario. 
 Warrant Investments 
 Warrant fair values are primarily determined using a Black Scholes option pricing model. Privately held warrants and equity-related securities are valued based on an analysis of various factors, including, but not limited to, those listed below. Increases or decreases in any of the unobservable inputs described below could result in a material change in fair value: 
 Underlying enterprise value of the issuer based on available information, including any information regarding the most recent financing round of borrower. Valuation techniques to determine enterprise value include market multiple approaches, income approaches or the use of recent rounds of financing and the portfolio company s capital structure. Valuation techniques are also utilized to allocate the enterprise fair value of a portfolio company to the specific class of common or preferred stock exercisable in the warrant. Such techniques take into account the rights and preferences of the portfolio company s securities, expected exit scenarios, and volatility associated with such outcomes to allocate the fair value to the specific class of stock held in the portfolio. Such techniques include option pricing models, including back solve techniques, probability weighted expected return models and other techniques determined to be appropriate. 
 Volatility, or the amount of uncertainty or risk about the size of the changes in the warrant investment price, is based on comparable publicly traded companies within indices similar in nature to the underlying company issuing the warrant. 
 The risk-free interest rates are derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve. The risk-free interest rates are calculated based on a weighted average of the risk-free interest rates that correspond closest to the expected remaining life of the warrant investment. 
 Other adjustments, including a marketability discount on private company warrant investments, are estimated based on the Adviser s judgment about the general industry environment. 
 Historical portfolio experience on cancellations and exercises of warrant investments are utilized as the basis for determining the estimated life of the warrant investment in each financial reporting period. Warrant investments may be exercised in the event of acquisitions, mergers or initial public offerings, and cancelled due to events such as bankruptcies, restructuring activities or additional financings. These events cause the expected remaining life assumption to be shorter than the contractual term of the warrant investment.

 Credit Facility 
 On July 15, 2020, the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary, the Financing Subsidiary, as the borrower, entered into a secured revolving credit facility (as amended, the Credit Facility pursuant to a Receivables Financing Agreement (the Receivables Financing Agreement ), by and among the Financing Subsidiary, the Company, individually and as collateral manager and as equityholder, the lenders from time to time party thereto, Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch DBNY ), as the facility agent, DBNY and MUFG Union Bank, N.A. MUFG ), as joint lead arrangers, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as paying agent and as collection account bank, the custodian party thereto, and Vervent Inc., as backup collateral manager. As of September 30, 2024, commitments available total million from lenders DBNY, MUFG, KeyBank National Association KeyBank and TIAA, FSB subject to an accordion feature, which allows the Financing Subsidiary to request an increase in the size of the Credit Facility to an amount not to exceed million (including by adding additional lenders under the Credit Facility), subject to certain conditions and the consent of the lenders. The Credit Facility is collateralized by all of the assets of the Financing Subsidiary, including the loans and other investments acquired by the Financing Subsidiary from time to time and collections thereon. 
 The revolving period under the Credit Facility is scheduled to expire on July 15, 2025, subject to an extension with the consent of the lenders and early termination if an event of default occurs or other adverse events, specified in the Receivables Financing Agreement, occur. The scheduled maturity date for the Credit Facility is January 15, 2027, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the terms of the Receivables Financing Agreement. Advances are made under the Credit Facility pursuant to a borrowing base, which generally utilizes a advance rate on the applicable net loan balance of assets held by the Financing Subsidiary, subject to excess concentrations and other restrictions set forth in the Receivables Financing Agreement. Advances under the Credit Facility accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to the applicable margin plus the greater of 3-month Term SOFR and and are subject to certain minimum principal utilization amounts during the revolving period. As of September 30, 2024, the applicable margin is equal to during the revolving period and increases to during the amortization period. 
 The Credit Facility includes customary representations and warranties and requires the Company and the Financing Subsidiary to comply with various covenants, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are subject to the leverage restrictions contained in the 1940 Act. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility of million and million, respectively, excluding deferred credit facility costs of million and million, respectively, which are included as assets in the Company s consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. The book value of the Credit Facility approximates fair value due to the relatively short maturity, cash repayments and market interest rates of the instrument. The fair value of the Credit Facility would be categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy if determined as of the reporting date. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had average outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility of million and million, respectively, at a weighted average interest rate of and , respectively.

million in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due April 2027 with a fixed interest rate of per year (the 2027 Notes ). The 2027 Notes were issued in a private placement to certain qualified institutional investors, pursuant to the terms of the Master Note Purchase Agreement, dated as of April 6, 2022 (the Note Purchase Agreement ). The 2027 Notes will mature on April 6, 2027, unless redeemed, purchased or prepaid prior to such date in accordance with their terms. In the event that a Below Investment Grade Event (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) occurs, the 2027 Notes will bear interest at a fixed rate of per year from the date of the occurrence of the Below Investment Grade Event to and until the date on which the Below Investment Grade Event is no longer continuing. 
 Interest on the 2027 Notes is due semiannually on April 6 and October 6 each year, beginning on October 6, 2022. The 2027 Notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at the Company s option at par plus accrued interest to the prepayment date and, if applicable, a make-whole premium. In addition, the Company is obligated to offer to prepay the 2027 Notes at par plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the date of prepayment, if certain change in control events occur. The 2027 Notes are general unsecured obligations of the Company that rank pari passu with all outstanding and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness issued by the Company; provided however, in the event that the Company creates, incurs, assumes or permits to exist liens on or with respect to any of its property or assets in connection with future secured indebtedness of more than an aggregate principal amount of million, the 2027 Notes will generally become secured concurrently therewith, equally and ratably with such indebtedness. 
 The Note Purchase Agreement contains customary terms and conditions for senior unsecured notes issued in a private placement, including, without limitation, affirmative and negative covenants such as information reporting, maintenance of the Company s status as a business development company within the meaning of the 1940 Act, a minimum asset coverage ratio of to 1.00, a minimum interest coverage ratio of to 1.00, and minimum stockholders equity of million, as adjusted upward by an amount equal to of the net proceeds from the issuance of shares of the Company s common stock subsequent to December 31, 2021.

 Forward-Looking Statements 
 The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and schedules thereto appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Except as otherwise specified, references to the Company , we , us , and our refer to TriplePoint Private Venture Credit Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about us, our current and prospective portfolio investments, our industry, our beliefs, and our assumptions. Words such as anticipates, expects, intends, plans, will, may, continue, believes, seeks, estimates, would, could, should, targets, projects, and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include statements as to: 
 our and our portfolio companies future operating results and financial condition, including our and our portfolio companies ability to achieve our respective objectives; 
 our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies; 
 our relationships with third parties, including but not limited to lenders and venture capital investors, including other investors in our portfolio companies; 
 the impact and timing of our unfunded commitments; 
 the expected market for venture capital investments; 
 the performance of our existing portfolio and other investments we may make in the future; 
 the impact of investments that we expect to make; 
 actual and potential conflicts of interest with TPC, the Adviser and its senior investment team and Investment Committee; 
 our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; 
 the dependence of our future success on the U.S. and global economies, including with respect to the industries in which we invest; 
 our expected financings and investments; 
 the ability of the Adviser to locate suitable investments for us and to monitor and administer our investments; 
 the ability of our Adviser to attract, retain and have access to highly talented professionals, including our Adviser s senior management team; 
 our ability to maintain our qualification as a RIC and as a BDC; 
 the adequacy of our and our portfolio companies available liquidity, cash resources, including our undrawn capital commitments from investors and the ability of our investors to fulfill their obligations under their respective subscription agreements, and working capital and compliance with covenants under our borrowing arrangements; 
 the ability of our portfolio companies to obtain financing on attractive terms or at all; 
 the timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations of our portfolio companies; and 
 the declaration, payment, amount and/or timing of future dividends or distributions. 
 These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements, including without limitation: 
 changes in laws and regulations, changes in political, economic or industry conditions, and changes in the interest rate environment or other conditions affecting the financial and capital markets; 
 the potential widespread re-emergence of COVID-19 or its variants, or a similar health pandemic, and the length and duration thereof in the United States as well as worldwide, and the magnitude of its impact and time required for economic recovery; 
 the potential for an economic downturn and the time period required for robust economic recovery therefrom; 
 a contraction of available credit, an inability or unwillingness of our lenders to fund their commitments to us and/or an inability to access capital markets or additional sources of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and impair our lending and investment activities; 
 interest rate volatility could adversely affect our results, particularly given that we use leverage as part of our investment strategy; 
 
 60 

currency fluctuations could adversely affect the results of our investments in foreign companies, particularly to the extent that we receive payments denominated in foreign currency rather than U.S. dollars; 
 risks associated with possible disruption in our or our portfolio companies operations due to the effect of, and uncertainties stemming from, adverse developments affecting the financial services industry and the venture banking ecosystem, including the potential for the failure of additional banking institutions, as well as due to wars and other forms of conflict, terrorist acts, security operations and catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes and global health epidemics; and 
 the risks, uncertainties and other factors we identify in Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K under Part I, Item 1A, and in our other filings with the SEC that we make from time to time. 
 Although we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. Important assumptions include, without limitation, our ability to originate new loans and investments, borrowing costs and levels of profitability and the availability of additional capital. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Overview 
 We are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 We were formed in October 2019 to capitalize on the strong worldwide demand from venture capital-backed companies for debt financing originated by the TPC global investment platform and commenced investment operations on May 27, 2020. We participate in and benefit from TPC s multi-stage Lifespan Approach by lending to early, later, and venture growth stage companies focused in technology and other high growth industries that are backed by TPC s select group of leading venture capital investors and generally have a global business strategy and products or services that appeal to customers and consumers worldwide. We generally view high growth industries as industries which experience a higher than average growth rate as compared to others as a result of demand for new products or services offered by companies in these industries. It is this demand and the potential global addressable market for their products or services that makes them attractive to venture capital investment and therefore attractive lending candidates for us. 
 Our investment objective is to maximize our total return to shareholders primarily in the form of current income from our secured loans, and secondarily through capital gains from equity kickers in the form of warrants and direct equity investments. 
 
 Portfolio Composition, Investment Activity and Asset Quality 
 Portfolio Composition 
 We originate and invest primarily in loans that have a secured collateral position and are used by venture capital-backed companies to finance their continued expansion and growth, and, on a select basis, equipment financings and revolving loans, together with, in many cases, attached equity kickers in the form of warrant investments, and direct equity investments. We believe these investments will provide us with a stable, fixed-income revenue stream along with the potential for our returns to be enhanced by equity-related gains. We underwrite our investments seeking an unlevered yield-to-maturity on our growth capital loans and equipment financings generally ranging from 10 to 18 and on our revolving loans generally ranging from 1 to 10 above the applicable prime rate, in each case, with potential for higher returns in the event we are able to exercise warrant investments and realize gains or sell our related equity investments at a profit. We make investments that our Adviser s senior investment team believes have a low probability of loss due to their expertise and either the existence of or the near-term potential for strong revenue or revenue growth, product validation, customer commitments, intellectual property, financial condition and enterprise value of the potential opportunity. The Adviser s senior investment team also generally seeks to invest no more than 5 of our total assets in equity investments.

 Category Category Definition Action Item Clear (1) Performing above expectations and/or strong financial or enterprise profile, value or coverage. Review quarterly. White (2) Performing at expectations and/or reasonably close to it. Reasonable financial or enterprise profile, value or coverage. Generally, all new loans are initially graded White. Contact portfolio company periodically in no event less than quarterly. Yellow (3) Performing generally below expectations and/or some proactive concern due to industry, business, financial and/or related factors. Adequate financial or enterprise profile, value or coverage. Contact portfolio company monthly or more frequently as determined by our Adviser s Investment Committee; contact venture capital investors. Orange (4) Needs close attention due to performance materially below expectations, weak financial and/or enterprise profile, concern regarding additional capital or exit equivalent. Contact portfolio company weekly or more frequently as determined by our Adviser s Investment Committee; contact venture capital investors regularly; our Adviser forms a workout group to minimize risk of loss. Red (5) Serious concern/trouble due to pending or actual default or equivalent. May experience partial and/or full loss. Maximize value from assets.

Net investment income (loss) is the difference between our income from interest, dividends, fees and other investment income and our operating expenses, including interest on borrowed funds. Net realized gains (losses) on investments is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and their amortized cost. Net unrealized gains (losses) on investments is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our net increase in net assets resulting from operations was 2.9 million and 6.8 million, respectively, which was comprised of 8.1 million and 10.3 million, respectively, of net investment income and 5.1 million and 3.5 million of net realized and unrealized losses, respectively. On a per common share basis for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net investment income was 0.34 and 0.51, respectively, and our net increase in net assets from operations was 0.12 and 0.33, respectively. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our net increase in net assets resulting from operations was 11.4 million and 5.1 million, respectively, which was comprised of 27.4 million and 32.7 million, respectively, of net investment income and 16.0 million and 27.5 million of net realized and unrealized losses, respectively. On a per common share basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net investment income was 1.15 and 1.61, respectively, and our net increase in net assets from operations was 0.48 and 0.25, respectively. 
 Investment Income 
 Total investment and other income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 15.4 million and 48.2 million, respectively. Total investment and other income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 18.0 million and 53.4 million, respectively. 
 The decrease in total investment and other income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, is due to a lower weighted average principal amount outstanding on our income-bearing debt investment portfolio and a lower weighted average portfolio yield on our income-bearing debt investment portfolio. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Total operating expenses consist of our base management fee, income incentive fee, capital gains incentive fee, interest expenses and amortization of fees, administration agreement expenses, and general and administrative expenses. We anticipate that our operating expenses would increase over time to the extent that our investment portfolio grows. However, we anticipate operating expenses, as a percentage of total assets and net assets, would generally decrease over time to the extent that our investment portfolio and capital base expand. We expect that base management and income incentive fees would increase to the extent that we grow our capital base and our earnings. The capital gains incentive fee depends on realized and unrealized gains and losses. Interest expenses will generally increase if we draw down on the Credit Facility or issue debt securities, and we generally expect expenses under the Administration Agreement and general and administrative expenses to increase over time to the extent that our investment portfolio grows, to meet the additional requirements associated with servicing a larger portfolio. 
 Total operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 7.4 million and 20.8 million, respectively. Total operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were 7.7 million and 20.7 million, respectively. 
 Base management fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 1.6 million and 4.6 million, respectively. Base management fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were 1.4 million and 4.1 million, respectively. Base management fees increased during the 2024 periods due to an increase in invested equity, primarily through the issuance of common stock. 
 We did not incur an income incentive fee for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as the income incentive fees were reduced by 1.6 million and 5.5 million, respectively, due to the total return requirement under the Advisory Agreement. We did not incur an income incentive fee for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, as the income incentive fees were reduced by 2.1 million and 6.5 million, respectively, due to the total return requirement under the Advisory Agreement. We did not incur a capital gains incentive fee during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the current and cumulative realized and unrealized losses we recorded on our investment portfolio during the periods. See Note 3. Related Party Agreements and Transactions to our unaudited financial statements with respect to the capital gains incentive fee expense accruals.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest and fees on our borrowings totaled 4.5 million and 12.2 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, interest and fees on our borrowings totaled 4.5 million and 12.7 million, respectively. Interest and fees decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding 2023 period, primarily due to a decrease in the weighted average borrowings outstanding during the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period, partially offset by an increase in the weighted average interest rate on our borrowings during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The weighted average interest rate on our borrowings slightly decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, expenses under the Administration Agreement and general and administrative expenses totaled 1.3 million and 4.0 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, expenses under the Administration Agreement and general and administrative expenses total 1.9 million and 3.9 million, respectively. 
 Net Realized Gains and Losses and Net Unrealized Gains and Losses 
 Realized gains and losses are included in net realized losses on investments in the consolidated statements of operations. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized net realized losses of 2.3 million and 9.3 million, respectively, primarily due to the write-offs of investments in certain portfolio companies, in addition to foreign currency adjustments. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized net realized losses of 0.2 million and 18.7 million, respectively, primarily due to the write-offs of investments in certain portfolio companies, in addition to foreign currency adjustments. 
 Unrealized gains and losses are included in net change in unrealized losses on investments in the consolidated statements of operations. 
 Net change in unrealized losses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 2.8 million and 6.7 million, respectively, resulting primarily from market rate adjustments and foreign currency adjustments. Net change in unrealized losses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 totaled 3.4 million and 8.8 million, respectively, resulting primarily from market rate adjustments and foreign currency adjustments, partially offset by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses on investments that were written off in the period. 
 Net change in realized and unrealized gains or losses in subsequent periods may be volatile as such results depend on changes in the market, changes in the underlying performance of our portfolio companies and their respective industries, and other market factors. 
 Portfolio Yield and Total Return 
 Investment income includes interest income on our debt investments, utilizing the effective yield method, including cash interest income as well as the amortization of any purchase premium, accretion of purchase discount, original issue discount, facilities fees, and the amortization and payment of the EOT payments. 
 The following table shows the weighted average annualized portfolio yield on our debt investments, excluding non-income producing investments, comprising of cash interest income, accretion of the net purchase discount, facilities fees and the value of warrant investments received, accretion of EOT payments and the accelerated receipt of EOT payments on prepayments:

 (1) Weighted average portfolio yields on debt investments for periods shown are the annualized rates of interest income recognized during the period divided by the average amortized cost of debt investments in the portfolio during the period. The calculation of weighted average portfolio yields on debt investments excludes any non-income producing debt investments, but includes debt investments on non-accrual status. The weighted average yields reported for these periods are annualized and reflect the weighted average yields to maturities. 
 (2) The weighted average portfolio yields on debt investments reflected above do not represent actual investment returns to our shareholders. 
 Our weighted average annualized portfolio yield on debt investments may be higher than an investor s yield on an investment in shares of our common stock. Our weighted average annualized portfolio yield on debt investments does not reflect operating expenses that may be incurred by us and, thus, by our stockholders. In addition, our weighted average annualized portfolio yield on debt investments and total return figures disclosed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q do not consider the effect of any sales commissions or charges that may be incurred in connection with the sale of shares of our common stock. Our weighted average annualized portfolio yield on debt investments and total return based on net asset value do not represent actual investment returns to common stockholders. Our weighted average annualized portfolio yield on debt investments and total return figures are subject to change and, in the future, may be greater or less than the rates set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our total return based on the change in net asset value was 1.0 and 3.9 , respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, our total return based on the change in net asset value was 2.5 and 1.8 , respectively. Total return based on net asset value is the change in ending net asset value per common share plus distributions per common share paid during the period divided by the beginning net asset value per common share for the period. The total return is for the period shown and is not annualized. 
 The following table shows our return on average total assets and return on average net asset value for the periods indicated:

 Critical Accounting Policies 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates, including with respect to the valuation of our investments, could cause actual results to differ. 
 Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management s judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We describe our most significant accounting policies in Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies in our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Critical accounting policies are those that require the application of management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. Management has utilized available information, including our past history, industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming the estimates and judgments, giving due consideration to materiality. We have identified the valuation of our investment portfolio, including our investment valuation policy (which has been approved by the Board), as our critical accounting policy and estimates. The critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with the risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Investment Valuation 
 Investment transactions are recorded on a trade-date basis. Our investments are carried at fair value in accordance with the 1940 Act and ASC Topic 946 and measured in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure , or ASC Topic 820, issued by the FASB. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of the market s participant who holds the financial instrument rather than an entity-specific measure. When market assumptions are not readily available, our own assumptions are set to reflect those that the Adviser believes market participants would use in pricing the financial instruments on the measurement date. 
 The availability of observable inputs can vary depending on the financial instrument and is affected by a variety of factors. To the extent the valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Our valuation methodology is approved by the Board, and the Board is responsible for the fair values determined. As markets change, new types of investments are made, or pricing for certain investments becomes more or less observable, management, with oversight from the Board, may refine our valuation methodologies to best reflect the fair value of our investments appropriately. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our investment portfolio, valued at fair value in accordance with our Board-approved valuation policy, represented 85.6 of our total assets, as compared to 86.1 of our total assets as of December 31, 2023.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents on hand, our available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility and our anticipated cash flows from operations, including from contractual monthly portfolio company payments and cash flows, prepayments, and the ability to liquidate any publicly traded investments, will be adequate to meet our cash needs for our daily operations, including to fund our unfunded commitment obligations. 
 Cash Flows 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities, consisting primarily of fundings and purchases, sales and repayments of investments and the items described in Results of Operations above, was 26.6 million and net cash used in financing activities, consisting primarily of net repayments under the Credit Facility and distributions paid, was 27.9 million. As of September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, was 59.6 million. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by operating activities, consisting primarily of fundings and purchases, sales and repayments of investments and the items described in Results of Operations above, was 22.0 million and net cash used in financing activities, consisting primarily of distributions paid, partially offset by net borrowings under the Credit Facility, was 18.3 million. As of September 30, 2023, cash, including restricted cash, was 40.8 million. 
 Capital Resources and Borrowings 
 As a BDC, we generally have an ongoing need to raise additional capital for investment purposes. As a result, we expect, from time to time, to access the debt and equity markets when we believe it is necessary and appropriate to do so. In this regard, we continue to explore various options for obtaining additional debt or equity capital for investments. This may include expanding or extending the Credit Facility, the issuance of additional shares of our common stock in exchange for capital contributions or the issuance of debt securities. If we are unable to obtain leverage or raise capital on terms that are acceptable to us, our ability to grow our portfolio could be substantially impacted. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had received capital commitments totaling 386.8 million in connection with our private offering of common stock, of which 354.7 million had been funded. Upon termination of our investment period, which occurred on December 19, 2023, our stockholders were released from funding obligations for any remaining undrawn capital commitments under their respective subscription agreements with us, subject to limited exceptions set forth in the subscription agreements. 
 Credit Facility 
 We have 250.0 million in total commitments available under the Credit Facility, subject to various covenants and borrowing base requirements. The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature, which allows the Financing Subsidiary to request an increase in the size of the Credit Facility to an amount not to exceed 400.0 million (including by adding additional lenders under the Credit Facility), subject to certain conditions and the consent of the lenders. The revolving period under the Credit Facility is scheduled to expire on July 15, 2025 and the maturity date of the Credit Facility is scheduled for January 15, 2027. Advances under the Credit Facility accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to the applicable margin plus the greater of 3-month Term SOFR and 0.50 , and are subject to certain minimum principal utilization amounts during the revolving period. As of September 30, 2024, the applicable margin is equal to 3.25 during the revolving period and increases to 4.25 during the amortization period. See Note 6. Borrowings in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the terms of the Credit Facility. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had outstanding borrowings of 80.5 million and 87.5 million, respectively, under the Credit Facility, excluding deferred credit facility costs of 2.3 million and 3.0 million, respectively, which are included as assets in the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 169.5 million and 162.5 million, respectively, of remaining capacity on our Credit Facility. 
 2027 Notes 
 On April 6, 2022, we issued 75.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Notes with a fixed interest rate of 5.86 per year. The 2027 Notes were issued in a private placement to certain qualified institutional investors, pursuant to the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement. The 2027 Notes will mature on April 6, 2027, unless redeemed, purchased or prepaid prior to such date in accordance with their terms. In the event that a Below Investment Grade Event (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) occurs, the 2027 Notes will bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.86 per year from the date of the occurrence of the Below Investment Grade Event to and until the date on which the Below Investment Grade Event is no longer continuing. 
 
 70 

The 2027 Notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at the Company s option at par plus accrued interest to the prepayment date and, if applicable, a make-whole premium. In addition, we are obligated to offer to prepay the 2027 Notes at par plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the date of prepayment, if certain change in control events occur. The 2027 Notes are general unsecured obligations that rank pari passu with all outstanding and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness issued by us; provided however, in the event that we create, incur, assume or permit to exist liens on or with respect to any of our property or assets in connection with future secured indebtedness of more than an aggregate principal amount of 25 million, the 2027 Notes will generally become secured concurrently therewith, equally and ratably with such indebtedness. See Note 6. Borrowings in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the 2027 Notes and the Note Purchase Agreement. 
 Series A Preferred Stock 
 On May 27, 2020, we sold 525 shares of Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock (the Series A Preferred Stock at a price of 1,000.00 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of 525,000. Distributions, including the payment of dividends and distribution of our assets upon dissolution, liquidation, or winding up, on the Series A Preferred Stock are senior to all other classes and series of our common stock to the extent of the aggregate liquidation preference of the Series A Preferred Stock 1,000 per share, or the Liquidation Value and all accrued but unpaid dividends and any applicable redemption premium on the Series A Preferred Stock. Dividends on each share of the Series A Preferred Stock are payable semiannually on June 30 and December 31 of each year and accrue at the rate of 12.0 per annum of the sum of the Liquidation Value thereof plus all accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, from and including the date of issuance to and including the earlier of (1) the date of any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company or (2) the date on which such share of Series A Preferred Stock is redeemed. Such dividends are generally cumulative with the result that all accrued and unpaid dividends must be fully paid or declared with funds irrevocably set apart for payment for all past dividend periods before any dividend, distribution or payment may be made to holders of outstanding shares of our common stock. See Liquidity and Capital Resources - Capital Resources and Borrowings in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 for more information regarding the Series A Preferred Stock. 
 Asset Coverage Requirements 
 We are required under the 1940 Act to meet a coverage ratio of total assets (less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities) to the aggregate amount of our senior securities, which generally includes all of our borrowings and any preferred stock, of at least 150 . As of September 30, 2024, our asset coverage for total borrowings and other senior securities was 279 . 
 Unfunded Commitments 
 We are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our unfunded commitments totaled 63.9 million and 72.2 million, respectively, of which 44,000 and 6.3 million, respectively, was dependent upon the portfolio companies reaching certain milestones before the debt commitment becomes available to them. 
 The following table shows our unfunded commitments by portfolio company as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

Our credit agreements contain customary lending provisions that allow us relief from funding obligations for previously made commitments in instances where the underlying portfolio company experiences material adverse events that affect the financial condition or business outlook for the portfolio company. Since these commitments may expire without being drawn upon, unfunded commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements or future earning assets for us. We generally expect 50 - 75 of our gross unfunded commitments to eventually be drawn before the expiration of their corresponding availability periods. 
 The fair value at the inception of the delay draw credit agreements with our portfolio companies is equal to the fees and/or warrants received to enter into these agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties credit profile. The unfunded commitment liability reflects the fair value of these future funding commitments. 
 
 Common Stock Distributions 
 We have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under the Code. To maintain RIC tax treatment, we must distribute at least 90 of our net ordinary income and net realized short-term capital gains in excess of our net realized long-term capital losses, if any, to our stockholders. In order to avoid a non-deductible 4 U.S. federal excise tax on certain of our undistributed income, we would need to distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of: (a) 98 of our ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gains or losses) for such calendar year; (b) 98.2 of the amount by which our capital gains exceed our capital losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for a one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year (unless an election is made by us to use our taxable year); and (c) certain undistributed amounts from previous years on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax. For the tax years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we were subject to a 4 U.S. federal excise tax and we may be subject to this tax in future years. In such cases, we will be liable for the tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement. 
 To the extent our taxable earnings fall below the total amount of our distributions for the year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders. Our Adviser monitors available taxable earnings, including net investment income and realized capital gains, to determine if a return of capital may occur for the year. We estimate the source of our distributions as required by Section 19(a) of the 1940 Act to determine whether payment of dividends are expected to be paid from any other source other than net investment income accrued for current period or certain cumulative periods, but we will not be able to determine whether any specific distribution will be treated as made out of our taxable earnings or as a return of capital until after the end of our taxable year. Any amount treated as a return of capital will reduce a stockholder s adjusted tax basis in his or her common stock, thereby increasing his or her potential gain or reducing his or her potential loss on the subsequent sale or other disposition of his or her common stock. On a quarterly basis, for any payment of dividends estimated to be paid from any other source other than net investment income accrued for current period or certain cumulative periods based on the requirements of Section 19(a) of the 1940 Act, we will send a written Section 19(a) notice to our registered stockholders along with the dividend payment. The estimates of the source of the distribution are interim estimates based on GAAP that are subject to revision, and the exact character of the distributions for tax purposes cannot be determined until the final books and records are finalized for the calendar year. Therefore, these estimates are made solely in order to comply with the requirements of Section 19(a) of the 1940 Act and should not be relied upon for tax reporting or any other purposes and could differ significantly from the actual character of distributions for tax purposes. The specific tax characteristics of our distributions will be reported to stockholders after the end of the taxable year. We intend to pay quarterly distributions to our common stockholders. 
 The following table shows our cash distributions per common share that have been authorized by our Board since commencement of operations to September 30, 2024:

 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions ASU 2022-03 ). ASU 2022-03 (1) clarifies the guidance in ASC 820 on the fair value measurement of an equity security that is subject to a contractual sale restriction and (2) requires specific disclosures related to such an equity security. ASU 2022-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within that fiscal year, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of these rules did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
 In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures ASU 2023-07 ). This change is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses, allowing financial statement users to better understand the components of a segment's profit or loss and assess potential future cash flows for each reportable segment and the entity as a whole. The amendments expand a public entity's segment disclosures by requiring disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker CODM ), clarifying when an entity may report one or more additional measures to assess segment performance, requiring enhanced interim disclosures and providing new disclosure requirements for entities with a single reportable segment, among other new disclosure requirements. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance with respect to the consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. We are also subject to risks relating to the capital markets; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; conditions affecting the general economy; legislative reform; and local, regional, national or global political, social or economic instability. U.S. and global capital markets and credit markets have recently been experiencing an increase in the level of volatility across such markets and in values of publicly-traded securities. Any continuation of the stresses on capital markets and credit markets, or a further increase in volatility, could result in a contraction of available credit for us and/or an inability by us to access the equity or debt capital markets, or could otherwise cause an inability or unwillingness of our lenders to fund their commitments to us, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in our earnings and in the relative values of our portfolio that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. Because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, there can be no assurance that a change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 Changes in interest rates may affect both our cost of funding and our interest income from portfolio investments. Our risk management systems and procedures are designed to identify and analyze our risk, to set appropriate policies and limits and to continually monitor these risks. Our investment income will be affected by changes in various interest rates or reference rates to the extent that any debt investments include floating interest rates. Debt investments are made with either floating rates that are subject to contractual minimum interest rates for the term of the investment or fixed interest rates. 
 A prolonged reduction in interest rates could reduce our gross investment income and could result in a decrease in our net investment income if such decreases in interest rates are not offset by a corresponding increase in the spread over Prime that we earn on any portfolio investments, a decrease in our operating expenses or a decrease in the interest rate of our floating interest rate liabilities. 
 As of September 30, 2024, a majority of the debt investments (approximately 80.2 , or 289.0 million in principal balance) in our portfolio bore interest at floating rates, which generally are Prime-based and all of which have interest rate floors of 3.25 or higher. Substantially all of our unfunded commitments float with changes in the Prime rate from the date we enter into the commitment to the date of the actual draw. In addition, our interest expense will be affected by changes in the floating rate based on certain indices referenced in the Credit Facility, including SOFR. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our floating rate borrowings totaled 80.5 million, which represented 51.8 of our outstanding debt as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, all of our floating rate debt investments were subject to interest-rate floors set at 3.25 or higher. Because the Prime Rate as of September 30, 2024 was 8.00 , which is at or above the interest-rate floors applicable to a majority of our floating rate debt investments, decreases in interest rates will impact our interest income to a limited extent until the Prime Rate reaches 3.25 , while increases in interest rates will increase our interest income to the extent that such rates exceed the applicable interest-rate floor. In addition, with respect to interest expense on our floating rate borrowings, we will benefit from any decreases in interest rates up to the point that the SOFR rate decreases to 0.50 , which is the SOFR interest-rate floor under the Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024. However, because current interest rates exceed the SOFR interest-rate floor under our Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024, our interest expense on floating rate borrowings will increase if rates rise. The following table illustrates the annual impact on our net investment income of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate floors for variable rate instruments) assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure from the September 30, 2024 consolidated statement of assets and liabilities: 
 Change in Interest Rates (in thousands) Increase (decrease) in interest income (Increase) decrease in interest expense Net increase (decrease) in net investment income Up 300 basis points 7,816 (3,750) 4,066 Up 200 basis points 5,119 (2,500) 2,619 Up 100 basis points 2,422 (1,250) 1,172 Up 50 basis points 1,073 (625) 448 Down 50 basis points (969) 625 (344) Down 100 basis points (1,782) 1,250 (532) Down 200 basis points (3,293) 2,500 (793) Down 300 basis points (4,552) 3,750 (802) 
 This analysis is indicative of the potential impact on our investment income as of September 30, 2024, assuming an immediate and sustained change in interest rates as noted. It should be noted that we anticipate growth in our portfolio funded in part with additional borrowings under the Credit Facility and potentially other borrowings, and such borrowings, to the extent they are floating rate borrowings, all else being equal, will increase our investment income sensitivity to interest rates, and such changes could be material. In addition, this analysis does not adjust for potential changes in our portfolio or our borrowing facilities after September 30, 2024 nor does it take into account any changes in the credit performance of our loans that might occur should interest rates change. 
 
 75 

Because it is our intention to hold loans to maturity, the fluctuating relative value of these loans that may occur due to changes in interest rates may have an impact on unrealized gains and losses during quarterly reporting periods. Based on our assessment of the interest rate risk, as of September 30, 2024, we had no hedging transactions in place as we deemed the risk acceptable, and we did not believe it was necessary to mitigate this risk at that time. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 We may also have exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates in connection with certain investments. Such investments are translated into U.S. dollars based on the spot rate at the relevant balance sheet date, exposing us to movements in the exchange rate. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to limit our foreign currency exposure with respect to the British Pound Sterling and Euro. For additional information refer to Note 4 Investments , included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report. 
 While hedging activities may mitigate our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates, certain hedging transactions that we may enter into in the future, such as interest rate swap agreements or foreign currency forward contracts, may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of higher interest rates or beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates with respect to our portfolio investments. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively hedge our interest rate risk or foreign currency exchange rate risk. 
 Substantially all of our assets and liabilities are financial in nature. As a result, changes in interest rates , foreign currency exchange rates and other factors drive our performance more directly than does inflation. Changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates do not necessarily correlate with changes in inflation rates. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. It should be noted that any system of controls, however well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Management has not identified any change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 Neither we, the Adviser, nor our subsidiaries are currently subject to any material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our businesses.

Furthermore, third parties may seek to impose liability on us in connection with the activities of our portfolio companies. While the outcome of any current legal proceedings cannot at this time be predicted with certainty, we do not expect any current matters will materially affect our financial condition or results of operations; however, there can be no assurance whether any pending legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in any future reporting period.
