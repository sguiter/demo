and used cash of in its operating activities
during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of . 

The
Company expects to incur substantial expenditures to further develop its technologies. The Company believes its working capital at September
30, 2024 will be sufficient to meet the business objectives as presently structured only through the fourth quarter of 2024. As such,
there is substantial doubt that we can continue as a going concern beyond that date. As a result, the Company has implemented certain
cost-saving initiatives, including the termination of its lease of the corporate office located in Tampa, Florida. 

The
Company s ability to continue operations after its current cash resources are exhausted depends on its ability to obtain additional
financing or achieve profitable operations, as to which no assurances can be given. Cash requirements may vary materially from those
now planned because of changes in the Company s focus and direction of its research and development programs, competitive and technical
advances, or other developments. Additional financing will be required to continue operations after the Company exhausts its current
cash resources and to continue its long-term plans for clinical trials and new product development. There can be no assurance that any
such financing can be realized by the Company, or if realized, what the terms thereof may be, or that any amount that the Company is
able to raise will be adequate to support the Company s working capital requirements until it achieves profitable operations. 

The
Company intends to seek additional funding through sublicensing arrangements, joint venturing or partnering, sales of rights to
technology, government grants and public or private financings. The Company s future success depends on its ability to raise
capital and ultimately generate revenue and attain profitability. The Company cannot be certain that additional capital, whether
through selling additional debt or equity securities or obtaining a line of credit or other loan, will be available to it or, if
available, will be on terms acceptable to the Company. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 the Company secured funding
through the sale of approximately 
million shares of its common stock and approximately million prefunded warrants to purchase shares of common stock in three public
offerings; the gross proceeds from the offerings, in the aggregate, were approximately 
million before underwriting discounts, commissions, and other expenses payable by the Company. If the Company issues additional
securities to raise funds, these securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of its common stock, and the
Company s current shareholders may experience dilution. If the Company is unable to obtain funds when needed or on acceptable
terms, the Company may be required to curtail its current development programs, cut operating costs and forego future development
and other opportunities.

common stock, par value Common Stock ). The Offering was undertaken pursuant to the Company s effective registration

The

by the Company were deducted. 

The
Placement Agency Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and agreements, conditions to closing, indemnification obligations
of the Company, including for liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, other obligations of the parties, and termination
provisions. 

On
September 4, 2024, the Company entered into a second placement agency agreement (the Second Placement Agency Agreement with Dawson James Securities Inc. Dawson James or the Placement Agent pursuant to which the Company engaged
Dawson James as the placement agent for a registered public offering by the Company (the Offering of an aggregate of (i)
 shares of its common stock, par value per share Common Stock ), or pre-funded warrants to purchase shares
of Common Stock Pre-Funded Warrants in lieu thereof (the Offering ). In connection with the Offering, the
Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement with an institutional investor to purchase
Common Stock and Pre-Funded Warrants. The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and agreements of the Company
and the purchaser and customary indemnification rights and obligations of the parties. 

The
Offering Price was per share of Common Stock. The Pre-Funded Warrants were priced at an offering price of per Pre-Funded
Warrant, which is equal to the offering price per share of Common Stock less the per share exercise price of each such Pre-Funded
Warrant. The Pre-Funded Warrants are immediately exercisable and terminate when exercised in full. 

The
Offering closed on September 5, 2024. Upon the closing of the Offering, the Company issued and sold shares of Common Stock
and Pre-Funded Warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock. 

Immediately
after the Offering, the Company had 
shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding and 
Pre-Funded Warrants outstanding to acquire 
shares of common stock. As of November 13, 2024 a total of Pre-Funded Warrants were exercised
for the same number of common shares and Pre-Funded Warrants remain unexercised. 

The
Placement Agent agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to arrange for the sale of the Common Stock and Pre-Funded Warrants. The Company
agreed to pay the Placement Agent a placement agent fee in cash equal to of the gross proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock
and Pre-Funded Warrants in this Offering. The Company also agreed to reimburse the Placement Agent for all reasonable travel and other
out-of-pocket expenses, including the reasonable fees of legal counsel, not to exceed . In addition, the Company agreed to issue
to the Placement Agent warrants to purchase up to five percent of the aggregate number of securities sold in the Offering (the Placement
Agent Warrants with an exercise price of the offering price of the Common Stock in the Offering and exercisable commencing
six months from the closing of the Offering and for five years thereafter. 

The
Offering resulted in gross proceeds to the Company of approximately million before deducting placement agent fees and other estimated
offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of approximately million from the offering
to fund the continued development of its ONP-002 product candidate and for general corporate purposes and working capital. 

The
Placement Agency Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and agreements by the Company, customary conditions to closing,
indemnification obligations of the Company, including for liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, other obligations
of the parties, and termination provisions. 

The
Offering was made pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-281618), which was declared effective by the Securities
and Exchange Commission on September 3, 2024. 

The
Company also entered into a warrant agency agreement with its transfer agent, Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company, who will
act as warrant agent for the Company, setting forth the terms and conditions of the Pre-Funded Warrants sold in the Offering (the Warrant

of the gross proceeds from the sale of Shares by the Agent under the ATM Agreement.
The Company has also agreed to reimburse the Agent for the fees and disbursements of its counsel, payable upon execution of the Sales
Agreement, in an amount not to exceed in addition to certain ongoing disbursements of its legal counsel up to per calendar
quarter. In addition, the Company has agreed to provide customary indemnification rights to the Sales Agent. 

Any
sales of Shares under the ATM Agreement will be made pursuant to the Company s Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-269225),
including the related prospectus, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on January 13, 2023, and
declared effective on January 25, 2023, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement dated October 11, 2024, and any applicable additional
prospectus supplements related to the Offering that form a part of the Registration Statement. 

The
aggregate market value of Shares eligible for sale in the Offering and under the ATM Agreement will be subject to the limitations of
General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3, to the extent required under such instruction. The prospectus supplement filed with the SEC on

prospectus supplement in the event it determines to offer more than of Shares in accordance with the terms of the Sales Agreement,
to the extent then permitted under General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3. 

The
Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to fund the continued development of its ONP-002 product candidate and for
general corporate purposes and working capital. The precise amount and timing of the application of these proceeds will depend upon a
number of factors, such as the timing and progress of our research and development efforts, our funding requirements and the availability
and costs of other funds. As of November 13, 2024 there have been no shares sold under the ATM Agreement. 

Previously, on August 8, 2024, the Company entered

Ladenburg
Thalmann Litigation 

On
December 7, 2022, the Company entered into an investment banking engagement letter with Ladenburg Thalmann, Ladenburg ).
The engagement letter was subsequently amended at various times (together with amendments to the Engagement Letter ). The
Company terminated the Engagement Letter as of August 15, 2023. Ladenburg sent the Company an invoice in the amount of ,
and a demand letter from Ladenburg s general counsel demanding payment thereof followed shortly thereafter. Ladenburg is of the
view that a fee is owed based on the Company s purchase of assets from Odyssey Health, Inc. The Company strongly disagrees that
any such fee is due to Ladenburg and initiated a confidential action for arbitration against Ladenburg with the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority FINRA on March 12, 2024, seeking, among other things, a declaratory judgment that no such fee is owed. On April
17, 2024 Ladenburg filed a Complaint in federal court in the Southern District of Florida, and also filed motion for a temporary restraining
order TRO and preliminary injunction seeking to move the venue from FINRA to the federal court in Miami-Dade County.
On May 3, 2024 the Magistrate Judge assigned to the case issued a Report and Recommendation denying the motion; although Ladenburg objected
to the Report and Recommendation, Magistrate Judge s Report and Recommendation, the District Court Judge adopted the Report and
Recommendation, finalizing the Court s denial of the requested injunctive relief. On May 9, 2024, the Company filed a motion to
dismiss in the federal court action, which is still currently pending. Meanwhile, the FINRA action continues and is set to be heard in
February of 2025. The Company believes Ladenburg s claims are unlikely to prevail and intends to defend itself vigorously. It is
possible, however, that there could be an unfavorable outcome or resolution of the claims asserted, which could negatively and materially
impact the Company s business, consolidated financial position and results of operations. Litigation is inherently uncertain and
there can be no assurance that the Company will prevail. The Company does not include an estimate of legal fees and other related defense
costs in its estimate of loss contingencies.

Overview 

Oragenics,
Inc. (the Company or we , or our was incorporated in November 1996. We are a development-stage
company dedicated to the research and development of nasal delivery pharmaceutical medications and vaccines. 

Commencing
in December of 2023, we are focused on the development of medical products that treat brain related illnesses and diseases and our lead
product candidate is for the development, requisite clinical trials and commercialization of ONP-002 for the treatment of mild traumatic
brain injury mTBI or Concussion ). 

Prior
to the purchase of our lead asset ONP-002, starting in May 2020 and through December 31, 2023 our lead asset was a nasal delivery vaccine
candidate to provide long-lasting immunity from SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19. 

In
September of 2023 the Company terminated its lease for the building where some of the research and development activities for its lantibiotic
program were undertaken. 

Currently
research and development activities related to the nasal vaccine platform and our lantibiotic program are inactive, and we will evaluate
alternative opportunities for these programs moving forward as we continue to strengthen our focus and expertise on our intranasal drug
delivery platform and drug candidates. 

About
Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) 

Concussions
are an unmet medical need that affects millions worldwide. Repetitive concussions are thought to increase the risk of developing
Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy CTE and other neuropsychiatric disorders. It is estimated that between 3.5 million
and 5 million concussions occur in the U.S. annually and that as many as 50 go unreported. The worldwide incidence of concussion is
estimated at 69 million. The global market for concussion treatment was valued at 6.9 billion in 2020 and is forecast to reach 8.9
billion by 2027, according to Grandview Research. Common settings for concussion include contact sports, military training and
operations, motor vehicle accidents, children at play and elderly assistive-living facilities due to falls.

Our
ONP-002 Neurology Asset for Brain Related Illness and Injury 

Following
our December 2023 acquisition of certain assets from Odyssey Health, Inc. Odyssey related to the segment of Odyssey s
business focused on developing medical products that treat brain related illnesses and diseases (the Neurology Assets our lead product and focus is on the development and commercialization of ONP-002 for the treatment of mTBI. 

ONP-002
to date has been shown to be stable up to 104 degrees for 18-months. The drug candidate is spray-dry manufactured into a powder and filled
into the novel intranasal device. The drug is then administered through the nasal passage from a unique nasal delivery device. The novel
intranasal device is lightweight and intended to be easy enough for self-administration use in the field or by medical personnel. 

We
believe the proprietary powder formulation and intranasal administration allows for rapid and direct accessibility to the brain. The
device is breath propelled and we expect it to allow patients to blow into the device which closes the soft palate in the back of the
nasopharynx, preventing the flow of drug to the lungs or esophagus, minimizes system exposure and side effects, and easily crosses the
blood brain barrier. This mechanism traps ONP-002 in the nasal cavity allowing for more abundant and faster drug availability in the
traumatized brain.

ONP-002
Pre-Clinical Trials 

The
drug has completed toxicology studies in rats and dogs. Those studies show that ONP-002 has a large safety margin of its predicted efficacious
dose. In preclinical animal studies, the drug demonstrated rapid and broad biodistribution throughout the brain while simultaneously
reducing swelling, inflammation, and oxidative stress, along with an excellent safety profile. 

Results
from the preclinical studies suggest that ONP-002 has an equivalent, and potentially superior, neuroprotective effect compared to related
neurosteroids. The animals treated with the drug post-concussion showed positive behavioral outcomes using various testing platforms
including improved memory and sensory-motor performance, and reduced depression/anxiety like behavior. 

ONP-002
Clinical Trials 

ONP-002
has completed a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy human subjects showing it is safe and well tolerated. 

Safety
studies have established a dosing regimen of 2X/day for fourteen days. The Phase 1 clinical trial was performed in Melbourne, Australia
with a Contract Research Organization CRO ), Avance Clinical Pty Ltd Avance Clinical and Nucleus Network
Pty Ltd. The country of Australia provides a currency exchange advantage and a tax rebate at the end of our fiscal year from the Australian
government on all Research and Development performed in Australia. 

The
Phase 1 study was double-blinded, randomized and placebo controlled (3:1, drug: placebo). Phase 1 used a Single Ascending/Multiple Ascending
(SAD/MAD) drug administration design. The SAD component was a 1X treatment (low, medium, or high dose) and the MAD component was a 1X/day
treatment for five consecutive days (low and medium dose). Blood and urine samples were collected at multiple time points for safety
pharmacokinetics. Standard safety monitoring was provided for each body system. 

Forty
human subjects (31 males, 9 females) were successfully enrolled in Phase 1. The Safety Review Board, made up of medical doctors, has
reviewed the trial data and has determined the drug is safe and well tolerated at all dosing levels. 

We
are preparing for Phase 2 clinical trials to further evaluate ONP-002 s safety and efficacy. Based on the Phase 1 data, we plan
to apply for an Investigational New Drug application with the FDA and conduct a Phase 2 trial in the United States. 

We
anticipate a Phase 2 clinical trial will be performed administering ONP-002 intranasally in concussed patients 2x a day for up to fourteen
days. The Phase 2a feasibility study is expected to be performed in Australia with a target initiation date in the fourth quarter of
2024 to be followed closely by a Phase 2b proof of concept study in the US. 

Recent
Developments Phase 2 

In
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we executed agreements with several vendors to advance our efforts toward starting Phase 2
clinical trials, including a contract with Avance Clinical to conduct Phase 2 clinical trials in Australia. 

On
August 8, 2024 we announced the successful completion of a study that indicates ONP-002 does not cause cardiotoxicity. Prior to conducting
a clinical trial, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires pharmaceuticals to be tested on cardiac receptors to ensure that
they do not show any causes of electrical malformations. Oragenics conducted hERG (human Ether- -go-go-Related Gene) ion channel
studies on ONP-002 under Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) with Charles River Laboratories. Like previous non-GLP hERG studies, inhibitory
concentrations were greater than 10 micromolar. Based on Phase I ONP-002 clinical trial dosing and subsequent blood plasma concentrations,
ONP-002 is expected to have a large cardiac safety margin, suggesting that ONP-002 treatment for concussion will not cause cardiac arrhythmia. 

On
August 12, 2024 we announced the successful completion of a study that indicates ONP-002 does not cause DNA damage and genotoxicity in
an animal model. Oragenics conducted an in vivo (animal) study to determine if multi-day treatments of ONP-002 cause DNA damage
and increased risk of cancer. Three concentrations of ONP-002 were used at a low, medium and high dose. Animal bone marrow was dissected
and analyzed for DNA damage. The results showed no evidence of genetic mutations, suggesting that ONP-002 does not affect the cell cycle
and therefore does not disrupt cell division that could be cancer-causing. Oragenics partnered with VivoPharm, Inc. to conduct this study
under Good Laboratory (GLP) conditions. These results suggest that multi-day treatment for concussion using ONP-002 will not cause genotoxicity. 

On
August 14, 2024 we announced the recent completion of the synthesis of its ONP-002 drug batch for the planned Phase II clinical trial.
The company reported 3-month stability with over 99 purity at temperatures ranging from -20 C to 104 C. Oragenics is confident
in its belief that ONP-002 will not require cumbersome cold chain protocols during transport and storage, maintaining its chemical structure
and function even in extreme temperatures. 

Field
conditions for contact sports and military operations involve a wide range of temperatures that may affect the stability and effectiveness
of drugs intended for acute concussion treatment. ONP-002 has been formulated as a spray-dried powder to improve stability in extreme
temperatures. In contrast, narrow temperature storage protocols can be cumbersome and pose greater risk for non-compliance during shipping
and field operations. 

On
August 21, 2024 we announced the completion of our spray-dried formulation and filling in the nasal device for ONP-002. The prefilled
formulation is intended to provide the needed drug-device dosing for the planned Phase IIa.

Our
Business Development Strategy 

Success
in the biopharmaceutical and product development industry relies on the continuous development of novel product candidates. Most product
candidates do not make it past the clinical development stage, which forces companies to look externally for innovation. Accordingly,
we expect from time to time, to seek strategic opportunities through various forms of business development, which can include strategic
alliances, licensing deals, joint ventures, collaborations, equity-or debt-based investments, dispositions, mergers and acquisitions.
We view these business development activities as a necessary component of our strategies, and we seek to enhance shareholder value by
evaluating business development opportunities both within and complementary to our current business as well as opportunities that may
be new and separate from the development of our existing product candidates. Our business strategy requires significant capital. 

As
part of the Company s efforts to preserve cash resources and focus on the development of our ONP-002 concussion drug product candidate,
the Company closed its facility in Alachua Florida where some of the work related to the lantibiotics program was performed, and has
paused all research and development activities related to our vaccine product candidate. Until the Company can secure additional capital
and determine an alternative solution to continue these research and development programs, they will remain paused. 

Financial
Overview 

Research
and Development Expenses 

Research
and development consist of expenses incurred in connection with the discovery and development of our product candidates. These expenses
consist primarily of employee-related expenses, which include salaries and benefits and attending science conferences; expenses incurred
under our License Agreements with third parties and under other agreements with contract research organizations, investigative sites
and consultants that conduct our clinical trials and a substantial portion of our nonclinical studies; the cost of acquiring and manufacturing
clinical trial materials; facilities, depreciation and other allocated expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent
and maintenance of facilities and equipment, and depreciation of fixed assets; license fees, for and milestone payments related to, in-licensed
products and technology; stock-based compensation expense; and costs associated with nonclinical activities and regulatory approvals.
We expense research and development costs as incurred. 

Our
research and development expenses can be divided into (i) clinical research, and (ii) nonclinical research and development activities.
Clinical research costs consist of clinical trials, manufacturing services, regulatory activities all of which are largely provided by
third parties. Nonclinical research and development costs consist of our research activities, research activities provided by third parties,
our own nonclinical studies, nonclinical studies provided by third parties, the acquisition of in process research and development, related
personnel costs and laboratory supplies, and other costs such as rent, utilities, depreciation and stock-based compensation we incur
associated with the development of our product candidates. While we are currently focused on advancing our product development programs,
our future research and development expenses will depend on the clinical success of our product candidates, as well as ongoing assessments
of each product candidate s commercial potential. In addition, we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which product candidates
may be subject to future partnerships, when such arrangements will be secured, if at all, and to what degree such arrangements would
affect our development plans, research expenses and capital requirements. 

Our
research and development expenses were 2,449,234 and 4,448,623 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
In 2023 our research and development costs consisted of our COVID vaccine program and our lantibiotics program, which were paused in
2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our research and development expenses consisted of the costs related to the development
of our ONP-002 neurology asset. Due to limited resources, while we continue our development efforts, we have focused our research and
development expenses to our ONP-002 drug and paused further development of our vaccine product and lantibiotics research until we can
raise additional capital. 

Our
current product development strategy contemplates continued research and development of our ONP-002 product. Continued research and development
expenses are subject to available capital and our ability to raise the additional required capital. The lengthy process of completing
pre-clinical studies, clinical trials, seeking regulatory approval, and expanding the potential claims we are able to make requires expenditure
of substantial resources. Any failure or delay in completing pre-clinical studies, clinical trials, or in obtaining regulatory approvals,
could cause a delay in generating product revenues and cause our research and development expenses to increase and, in turn, have a material
adverse effect on our operations. Our current product candidate is not expected to be commercially available until we are able to obtain
regulatory approval from the FDA or the regulatory authority in other jurisdictions where we may seek approval. 

Our
plan is to budget and manage expenditures in research and development such that they are undertaken in a cost-effective manner yet still
advance the research and development efforts. Subject to available capital, overall research and development expenses could increase
as a result of our concussion product candidate. Our research and development projects are currently expected to be taken to the point
where they can be licensed or partnered with larger pharmaceutical companies.

Recent
Financing 

On
September 4, 2024, we announced the sale of 3 million shares of our common stock and Pre-Funded Warrants to purchase 5 million shares
of common stock, par value 0.001, through a placement agreement with Dawson James Securities, Inc. Dawson James at
an offering price per share of common stock of 0.55. The offering resulted in gross proceeds of 4.45 million before deducting
placement agent fees and other estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. We also agreed to issue placement agent warrants Dawson James Warrants to purchase up to 5 of the aggregate number of securities sold in the offering with an
exercise price 125 of the offering price of the common stock in the offering. The Dawson James Warrants are exercisable for five
years from the date of closing the offering and are initially exercisable six months from the closing of the Offering. 

We
intend to use the net proceeds from the offering to fund the continued development of ONP-002 and for general corporate purposes and
working capital. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive, finance, and administrative
functions. Other general and administrative expenses include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses,
patent filing, and professional fees for legal, consulting, auditing and tax services. 

We
are aware that certain general and administrative expenses could increase for, among others, the following reasons: 

the efforts we undertake
 from, time to time, to raise additional capital; and 

consulting, legal, accounting
 and investor relations costs associated with being a public company. 

Other
Income (Expense) 

Other
income (expense) includes miscellaneous income as well as interest income and expense. Interest income consists of interest earned on
our cash and cash equivalents. The primary objective of our investment policy is capital preservation. Interest expense consists primarily
of interest and costs associated with our indebtedness.

Results
of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 2024 and 2023 

Grant
revenue. There was no grant revenue for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024. For the comparable three and
nine month periods in 2023, there was 7,466 and 37,653 in grant revenue, respectively. This decrease was attributable to awards received
for a small business innovation research grant that expired in the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. 

Research
and Development. Research and development expenses were 879,041 and 2,449,234, respectively, for the three and nine month periods
ended September30, 2024, compared to 769,350 and 4,448,623 for the comparable three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2023.
This is an increase 14 and a decrease of 45 for the comparable three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024. 

This
decrease for the nine month comparable periods was mainly driven by decreased costs associated with the development of our ONP-002 concussion
drug as compared to development costs associated with our COVID vaccine product and our lantibiotics program. For the three months ended
September 30, 2023, research and development expenses for our COVID vaccine and lantibiotics programs were approximately 0.8 million
and primarily associated with costs for outside consultants. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, research and development
expense related to ONP-002 was approximately 0.9 million. For the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively
our research and development expenses were approximately 2.4 million for our ONP-002 product and 4.4 million for our vaccine product
and lantibiotics programs. 

General
and Administrative. General and administrative expenses were approximately 1.6 million and 1.3 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively. General and administrative expenses for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024,
were approximately 4.8 million compared to 3.7 million for the comparable nine month period in 2023, an increase of approximately 1
million or 29 . This increase was primarily due to increased expenses related to: 

Consulting expenses - 289,406 

Investor relations - 526,643 

Salaries, wages, and bonus
 expense - 201,820 

Legal expense - 159,526 

Accounting expense 
 97,406 

Board of Director fees
 - 79,785 

Travel expense - 23,549 

These
expense increases were offset by decreases in: 

Rent, utilities and other
 office related expenses - 275,263 as well as 

Public company, stock compensation,
 and insurance expenses. 

Other
Income (Expense). Other income and expense, net, was (25,590) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 81,561
for the comparable three months in 2023. For the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, other income and expense, net,
was (15,412) and 200,271 respectively, resulting in a change of 215,683 or 108 for the comparable nine month periods. The net change
was primarily attributable to a reduction in interest income due to lower cash balances in interest earning accounts for the comparable
periods. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Since
our inception, we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities in our initial public offering, the sale
of equity securities and warrants in private placements, debt financing, warrant exercises, public offerings, and grants. During the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our operating activities used cash of 6,579,029 and 6,188,335 respectively. The change
is primarily driven by changes in net losses adjusted for non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. We had a working
capital surplus of 1,986,837 and 2,067,593 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

19 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our financing activities provided cash of 6,239,577 and 464,479 respectively. The
cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to net proceeds from our underwritten
public offerings. 

The
Company has made several changes to reduce cash used in operations until additional capital can be obtained. These changes include a
reduction in staffing and a reduction in research and development activity. These changes have positively impacted the forecast of cash
resources available for operations, which we believe will allow us to fund our operating plan through the fourth quarter of 2024.

December 28, 2023, as part of consideration paid to Odyssey and pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement executed with Odyssey, we issued
8,000,000 shares of convertible Series F Preferred Stock. The Series F Preferred Stock is convertible on a one-for one basis. The Series
F Preferred Stock has no voting rights, is ranked junior to our Series A and Series B Preferred Stock and is at parity with our common
stock, in addition there shall be no dividends paid on the Series F Preferred Stock. At the closing of the Odyssey transaction 511,308
shares of Series F Preferred Stock were converted into 511,308 shares of common stock. At September 30, 2024, there were 7,488,692 shares
of Series F Preferred Stock outstanding.

Future
Capital Requirements 

On
April 18, 2024, we received Notice from the NYSE American that we are no longer in compliance with NYSE American s continued listing
standards. Specifically, we are not in compliance with the continued listing standards set forth in Sections 1003(a)(ii) and 1003(a)(iii)
of the NYSE American Company Guide. Section 1003(a)(ii) requires a listed company to have stockholders equity of 4 million or
more if the listed company has reported losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in three of its four most recent fiscal years.
Section 1003(a)(iii) requires a listed company to have stockholders equity of 6 million or more if the listed company has reported
losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in its five most recent fiscal years. Subsequently, the NYSE American notified
the Company that it also is not in compliance with subsection (i) Section 1003(a), which requires stockholders equity of no less
than 2,000,000 if the Company has sustained losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in two of its three most recent fiscal
years. 

We reported stockholders equity of 3.2
million as of December 31, 2023, and 3 million as of September 30, 2024. Additionally, we have reported losses from continuing operations
and/or net losses in our five most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2023. 

The
Notice further provides that we must submit a plan of compliance (the Plan by May 18, 2024 (the Deadline addressing how we intend to regain compliance with the continued listing standards by October 18, 2025. The Plan is required to include
specific milestones, quarterly financial projections and details related to any strategic initiatives we plan to complete. 

We
submitted the Plan by the Deadline and on June 18, 2024 we were notified by the NYSE American that our Plan to regain compliance
with NYSE American s continued listing standards had been accepted. As part of the acceptance we were granted a plan period
through October 18, 2025 to regain compliance. During the plan period, we will be subject to quarterly monitoring for compliance with the plan. If we do
not regain compliance with NYSE American s listing standards by October 18, 2025, or if we do not make progress consistent
with our plan, the NYSE American may initiate delisting proceedings. 

Our
common stock will continue to be listed on NYSE American during the plan period under the symbol OGEN with a below
compliance indicator appended to our ticker symbol (with the added designation of .BC ). Our receipt of the notification
from NYSE American accepting the compliance Plan does not affect our business operations or our reporting requirements with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. 

We
are committed to undertaking a transaction or transactions in the future to achieve compliance with the NYSE American s requirements.
However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve compliance with the NYSE American s continued listing standards
within the required timeframe. Additionally, we can provide no assurance that the transaction or transactions necessary to achieve compliance
can be obtained or that they can be obtained with terms favorable to investors. 

If
the Common Stock ultimately were to be delisted for any reason, it could negatively impact the Company by (i) reducing the liquidity
and market price of the Company s Common Stock; (ii) reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire the Common Stock,
which could negatively impact the Company s ability to raise equity financing; and (iii) limiting the Company s ability to
use a registration statement to offer and sell freely tradable securities, thereby preventing the Company from accessing the public capital
markets; and (iv) impairing the Company s ability to provide equity incentives to its employees. 

Our
capital requirements for the remainder of 2024 will depend on numerous factors, including our ability raise additional capital including
through possible joint ventures and/or partnerships. We expect to incur substantial expenditures to further develop or commercialize
our technologies including continued increases in costs related to research, nonclinical testing and clinical trials, as well as costs
associated with our capital raising efforts and being a public company. We will require substantial funds to conduct research and development
and nonclinical and Phase 2 clinical testing of our licensed, patented technologies and to develop sublicensing relationships for the
Phase 2 and 3 clinical testing and manufacture and marketing of any products that are approved for commercial sale. Our financing plans
include seeking both equity and debt financing, alliances or other partnership agreements with entities interested in our technologies,
or other business transactions that would generate sufficient resources to ensure continuation of our operations and research and development
programs. 

22 

Our
current available cash and cash equivalents provide us with limited liquidity. We believe our existing cash will allow us to fund our
operating plan through the fourth quarter of 2024. As a result, we have implemented certain cost-saving initiatives, including reducing
our efforts and staff focused on our lantibiotics program and our vaccine product candidate, which are expected to negatively impact
the development of these programs. See, Risk Factors. We expect to manage the timing of our development expenditures and
to continue to seek additional funding for our operations. Any required additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms,
if at all. If we were unable to obtain additional financing, we may be required to reduce the scope of, delay or eliminate some or all
of our planned clinical testing, research and development and commercialization activities, which could harm our business. The sale of
additional equity or debt securities may result in additional dilution to our shareholders. If we raise additional funds through the
issuance of debt securities or preferred stock, these securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain
covenants that would restrict our operations. We also will require additional capital beyond our currently forecasted amounts, for example,
as we seek to move forward with the development of ONP-002 we will require additional capital. In addition, we continue to pursue other
non-dilutive opportunities for our COVID-19 research and development funding opportunities through governmental and nongovernmental sources,
as well as potential research collaboration arrangements with academic institutions and other commercial partners. Our ability to advance
the development of our ONP-002 concussion candidate at our currently anticipated pace, is dependent upon our ability to secure additional
capital resources through these funding opportunities or an alternative capital raise, such as an equity or debt financing or other strategic
business collaboration. 

Because
of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and clinical testing of our product candidates, we are
unable to estimate the exact amounts of our working capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors,
including, but not limited to: 

Conducting preclinical
 research and phase 2 clinical trials for our ONP-002 concussion drug, 

Our ability to partner
 or collaborate with third parties; 

Identifying and securing
 clinical sites for the conduct of human trials for our product candidates; 

The number and characteristics
 of the product candidates we pursue; 

The scope, progress, results
 and costs of researching and developing our product candidate, and conducting nonclinical and clinical trials 

The timing of, and the
 costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates; 

Our ability to maintain
 current research and development licensing agreements and to establish new strategic partnerships, licensing or other arrangements
 and the financial terms of such agreements; 

The costs involved in preparing,
 filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation; 

The timing, receipt and
 amounts of sales of, or royalties on, our products and future products, 

We
have based our estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong. We may need to obtain additional funds sooner or in greater amounts
than we currently anticipate. Potential sources of financing include strategic relationships, grants, public or private sales of our
shares or debt and other sources. We may seek to access the public or private equity markets when conditions are favorable due to our
long-term capital requirements. We do not have any committed sources of financing at this time, and it is uncertain whether additional
funding will be available when we need it on terms that will be acceptable to us, or at all. If we raise funds by selling additional
shares of common stock or other securities convertible into common stock, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be
diluted. If we are not able to obtain financing when needed, we may be unable to carry out our business plan. As a result, we may have
to significantly limit our operations and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially harmed.

Critical
Accounting Estimates and Policies 

Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America US GAAP ).
The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with US GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions
that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to
be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been
made could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. The principal area of estimation reflected in
the condensed consolidated financial statements are estimates for research and development expenses and related prepaid and accrued expenses,
which are based on the percentage of completion of the Company s contracts with Contract Research Organizations. 

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

There
are no accounting pronouncements issued or effective during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have had or are expected to
have an impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

ITEM 3. 
 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
 RISK 

Oragenics,
Inc. is a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and is not required to provide
the information required under this item. 

ITEM 4. 
 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Management s
evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
of the Securities Exchange Act was performed under the supervision and participation of our senior management, including our President
and Interim Principal Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The purpose of disclosure controls and procedures is to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to management, including our President and Interim Principal Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosures. Based upon that evaluation, our Interim Principal Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 in ensuring that information
required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
with the time periods specified in the Securities and exchange Commission s rules and forms. 

Changes
in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

Our
management, with the participation of our President and Interim Principal Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded
there were no other significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations
on the Effectiveness of Controls 

Our
management, including our Interim Principal Executive Officer and President, and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our Disclosure
Controls and internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can
provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control
system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments
in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented
by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management or board override of the control. 

The
design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can
be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. 
 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

On
December 7, 2022, the Company entered into an investment banking engagement letter with Ladenburg Thalmann, Ladenburg ).
The engagement letter was subsequently amended at various times (together with amendments to the Engagement Letter ). The
Company terminated the Engagement Letter as of August 15, 2023. Ladenburg sent the Company an invoice in the amount of 2,500,000,
and a demand letter from Ladenburg s general counsel demanding payment thereof followed shortly thereafter. Ladenburg is of the
view that a fee is owed based on the Company s purchase of assets from Odyssey Health, Inc. The Company strongly disagrees that
any such fee is due to Ladenburg and initiated a confidential action for arbitration against Ladenburg with the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority FINRA on March 12, 2024, seeking, among other things, a declaratory judgment that no such fee is owed. On April
17, 2024 Ladenburg filed a Complaint in federal court in the Southern District of Florida, and also filed motion for a temporary restraining
order TRO and preliminary injunction seeking to move the venue from FINRA to the federal court in Miami-Dade County.
On May 3, 2024, the Magistrate Judge assigned to the case issued a Report and Recommendation denying the motion; although Ladenburg objected
to the Report and Recommendation, Magistrate Judge s Report and Recommendation, the District Court Judge adopted the Report and
Recommendation, finalizing the Court s denial of the requested injunctive relief. On May 9, 2024, the Company filed a motion to
dismiss in the federal court action, which is still currently pending. Meanwhile, the FINRA action continues and is set to be heard in
February of 2025. The Company believes Ladenburg s claims are unlikely to prevail and intends to defend itself vigorously. It is
possible, however, that there could be an unfavorable outcome or resolution of the claims asserted, which could negatively and materially
impact the Company s business, consolidated financial position and results of operations. Litigation is inherently uncertain and
there can be no assurance that the Company will prevail. The Company does not include an estimate of legal fees and other related defense
costs in its estimate of loss contingencies. 

ITEM 1A. 
 RISK FACTORS 

In
addition to the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A,
subsection Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 which could materially
affect our business, financial condition or future results of operations. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us
or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and future results
of operations. The following information updates, and should be read in conjunction with, the risk factors previously disclosed in Item
1A, subsection Risk Factors to Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed
on March 29, 2024. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed under the
caption Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Risks
Related to Our Business 

We
have incurred significant losses since our inception and expect to continue to experience losses for the foreseeable future. 

We
have incurred significant net losses and negative cash flow in each year since our inception, including net losses of approximately 7.2
million and 7.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and approximately 21 million for the year
ended December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, our accumulated deficit was approximately 213 million. We have devoted a significant
amount of our financial resources to research and development, including our nonclinical development activities and clinical trials.
We expect that the costs associated with our plans to begin phase 2 clinical trials, contract manufacturing and file an IND for our concussion
product candidate will continue and, to have successful results, likely will require an increase in the level of our overall expenses
going forward. As a result, we expect to continue to incur substantial net losses and negative cash flow for the foreseeable future.
These losses and negative cash flows have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our shareholders equity and working
capital. Our current cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are not sufficient to fully implement our business strategy and
sustain our operations. As a result of our limited resources, we have undertaken cost-saving initiatives, including reducing our efforts
and staff focused on our COVID vaccine candidate and our lantibiotics program. Our actual costs may ultimately vary from our current
expectation, which could materially impact our use of capital and our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources
will be adequate to support our operations. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization,
we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of substantial expenses or when, or if, we will be able to generate the revenue
necessary to achieve or maintain profitability. Due to of our accumulated losses and substantial doubt that we can continue as a going
concern beyond December 2024, the Company is evaluating various opportunities for its Lantibiotics Program and its N-CoV2-1 vaccine
product candidate, as well as alternative assets that could be acquired or developed. These opportunities could include a wide range
of options including, among other things, a potential sale, spin-off, fund raising, combination or other strategic transaction, which
may also include the winding down of research and development activities. The result of this process may result in the liquidation of
assets for significantly less than amounts that have been invested in them, the write-off of prior expenses incurred in connection with
the development of such assets and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity. Notwithstanding the
above, the Company will seek to maximize the value of such assets to the extent possible. Until we can generate a sufficient amount of
product revenue, if ever, we expect to finance future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or corporate
or government collaboration and licensing arrangements. If we do not succeed in raising additional funds on acceptable terms, we may
be unable to complete existing nonclinical and planned clinical trials or obtain approval of our product candidates from the FDA and
other regulatory authorities. We believe our existing cash will allow us to fund our operating plan only through the fourth quarter of
2024. 

25 

We
may have difficulty raising additional capital, which could deprive us of the resources necessary to implement our business plan, which
would adversely affect our business, results of operation and financial condition. 

We
need to raise additional capital to fund the development and commercialization of our product candidates and to operate our business.
The need to raise additional capital is expected to increase as we continue our work research and development activities and preparation
to start phase 2 clinical trials for ONP-002. In order to support the initiatives envisioned in our business plan, we will need to raise
additional funds through the sale of assets, public or private debt or equity financing, collaborative relationships or other arrangements.
If our operations expand faster or at a higher rate than currently anticipated, we may require additional capital sooner than we expect.
We are unable to provide any assurance or guarantee that additional capital will be available when needed by our company or that such
capital will be available under terms acceptable to our company or on a timely basis. 

Our
ability to raise additional financing depends on many factors beyond our control, including the state of capital markets, the market
price of our common stock and the development or prospects for development of competitive products by others. If additional funds are
raised through the issuance of equity, convertible debt or similar securities of our company, the percentage of ownership of our company
by our company s stockholders will be reduced, our company s stockholders may experience additional dilution upon conversion,
and such securities may have rights or preferences senior to those of our common stock. The preferential rights granted to the providers
of such additional financing may include preferential rights to payments of dividends, super voting rights, a liquidation preference,
protective provisions preventing certain corporate actions without the consent of the fund providers, or a combination thereof. We are
unable to provide any assurance that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us or at all. 

If
adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, with limited capital, we expect to continue to hold research
and development of our lantibiotics and Covid programs and may reduce or slow research and development activity of our ONP-002 lead asset.
Thus, the unavailability of capital could substantially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

With
limited resources we have paused our other product candidate research and development and now rely on the progress and success of ONP-002. 

With
limited capital, we have put the research and development of our COVID vaccine program and our lantibiotics program on hold and have
chosen instead to focus the limited capital on the development of ONP-002. As such, our future success currently depends on the successful
development of ONP-002, our concussion asset, of which there can be no assurances. 

We
are heavily dependent upon the ability and expertise of our management team and a very limited number of employees and consultants; the
loss of such individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. 

We
currently have a very small management team. Our success is dependent upon the ability, expertise and judgment of our senior management
and consultants. While employment agreements are customarily used as a primary method of retaining the services of key employees, these
agreements cannot assure the continued services of such employees. Any loss of the services of such individuals could have a material
adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. Mr. Redmond continues to serve as President and CEO of Odyssey,
which may give rise to conflicts of interest. 

We
believe that our future success with regard to the Neurology Assets depends on the skills and efforts of our senior management and other
key personnel, including Jacob VanLandingham, Ph.D., one of the Company s independent contractors. The loss of the services of
any of these individuals could harm our ability to successfully pursue the development of the Neurology Assets. If any of our executive
officers or key personnel left or was otherwise unable to work and we were unable to find a qualified replacement and/or to obtain adequate
compensation for such loss, we may be unable to manage our business, which could harm our operating results and financial condition. 

On
December 5, 2022, the Mississippi Department of Human Services MDHS filed an Amended Complaint in the Circuit Court of
Hinds County, Mississippi First Judicial District against Mississippi Community Education Center, Inc., a non-profit corporation, Nancy
New, its director, Prevacus, Dr. VanLandingham its founder, and several other defendants, alleging, among other things, a conspiracy
to defraud the MDHS. Prevacus, Inc., is the Company from whom Odyssey purchased the Neurology Assets in 2021. The MDHS is designated
by Mississippi law as the State agency exclusively responsible for administering the federally-authorized and federally-funded anti-poverty
(or welfare program known as the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, or TANF. With regard to
Prevacus and Dr. VanLandingham, the complaint alleges that 2.1 million was funneled through the Mississippi Community Education Center,
a nonprofit run by Nancy New, to Prevacus and PresolMD, another company founded by Dr. VanLandingham. The MDHS, among other things, is
seeking to recover 2.1 million it alleges went to Prevacus and PresolMD. Prevacus and Dr. VanLandingham have denied any wrongdoing and
have denied being aware that the funds received from Community Education Center, Inc. were TANF funds. However, recently, Dr. VanLandingham
plead guilty to one federal charge of wire fraud in connection with this case and is awaiting sentencing, the timing and results of which
are uncertain. The Company does not believe it has any financial exposure related to the reimbursement of the funds paid to Prevacus
and does not believe there are any grounds on which the Company could become embroiled in the foregoing legal proceedings. Dr. VanLandingham
is not an Officer or Director of Oragenics but is instead an independent contractor. Nevertheless, any negative media related to foregoing
legal proceedings, and in particular any negative media related to the Neurology Assets or Dr. VanLandingham, may negatively impact the
Company s ability to raise capital and otherwise continue the development of the Neurology Assets. Furthermore, while the Company
has relationships with other experts in the field, including Frank Peacock, MD, the Company s Chief Clinical Officer, Dr. VanLandingham s
ability to continue to assist in the development of the Neurology Assets may be negatively impacted by the foregoing legal proceedings
which could negatively impact the Company s ability to raise capital and otherwise continue the development of the Neurology Ass ets.

Risks
Related to Our Common Stock 

We
cannot assure you that we will continue to be listed on the NYSE American. 

Our
common stock commenced trading on the NYSE American (formerly the NYSE MKT) on April 10, 2013, and we are subject to certain NYSE American
continued listing requirements and standards. On April 18, 2024 we received notification (the Notice from the NYSE American
that we were no longer in compliance with NYSE American s continued standards, Specifically, the letter stated that the Company
was in compliance with the continued listing standards set forth in Sections 1003(a)(ii) and 1003(a)(iii) of the NYSE American Company
Guide (the Company Guide ). Section 1003(a)(ii) requires a listed company to have stockholders equity of 4 million
or more if the listed company has reported losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in three of its four most recent fiscal
years. Section 1003(a)(iii) requires a listed company to have stockholders equity of 6 million or more if the listed company
has reported losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in its five most recent fiscal years. On August 13, 2024, we received
a second notice from the NYSE American LLC informing us that us that we also are not in compliance with subsection (i) of Section 1003(a),
which requires stockholders equity of no less than 2,000,000 if the Company has sustained losses from continuing operations and/or
net losses in two of its three most recent fiscal years. We reported stockholders equity of 3.2 million as of December 31, 2023,
and 3 million as of September 30, 2024. Additionally, we have reported losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in our five
most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2023. On May 17, 2024, we submitted a plan of compliance (the Plan to the
NYSE American. On June 18, 2024, the NYSE American accepted our Plan; the Company will be able to continue its listing during the Plan
period and will be subject to continued periodic review by the NYSE American staff. If we are not in compliance with the continued listing
standards by October 18, 2025, or if the Company does not make progress consistent with the Plan during the Plan period, the Company
will be subject to delisting procedures as set forth in the NYSE American Company Guide. The Company is committed to undertaking a transaction
or transactions in the future to achieve compliance with the NYSE American s requirements. However, there can be no assurance that
the Company will be able to achieve compliance with the NYSE American s continued listing standards within the required timeframe.
Further, the Company may fall out of compliance with other provisions of the NYSE American continued listing requirements and standards,
including with regard to the Company s stock price. If the Common Stock ultimately were to be delisted for any reason, it could
negatively impact the Company by (i) reducing the liquidity and market price of the Company s Common Stock; (ii) reducing
the number of investors willing to hold or acquire the Common Stock, which could negatively impact the Company s ability to raise
equity financing; (iii) limiting the Company s ability to use a registration statement to offer and sell freely tradable securities,
thereby preventing the Company from accessing the public capital markets; and (iv) impairing the Company s ability to provide
equity incentives to its employees. 

The
issuance of additional equity securities by us in the future would result in dilution to our existing common shareholders. 

Our
Board of Directors has authority, without action or vote of our shareholders, to issue all or a part of our authorized but unissued shares,
except where shareholder approval is required by law or the rules of any exchange on which our shares are listed. Any issuance of additional
equity securities by us in the future could result in dilution to our existing common shareholders. Such issuances could be made at a
price that reflects a discount or a premium to the then-current trading price of our common stock. In addition, our business strategy
may include expansion through internal growth by acquiring complementary businesses, acquiring or licensing additional products or brands,
or establishing strategic relationships with targeted customers and suppliers. In order to do so, or to finance the cost of our other
activities, we may issue additional equity securities that could result in further dilution to our existing common shareholders. These
issuances would dilute the percentage ownership interest of our existing common shareholders, which would have the effect of reducing
their influence on matters on which our shareholders vote and might dilute the book value of our common stock. For example, our outstanding
shares of common stock at December 31, 2023 was 3,080,693, due to additional common stock issuances related to capital raises, at September
30, 2024 our outstanding shares of common stock was 9,387,547. Furthermore, if Odyssey or the holders of Preferred Shares Series A and
B convert their preferred shares into common stock an additional 7,511,220 shares of common stock could be issued resulting in dilution
to our existing common shareholders. Additionally, as of November 13, 2024, 1,139,705 Pre-Funded Warrants remain unexercised.
