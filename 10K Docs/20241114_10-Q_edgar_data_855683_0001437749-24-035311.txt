The forward-looking statements included herein are based on current expectations that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. Milestone Scientific s plans and objectives are based, in part, on assumptions involving the changes in the distribution of its products and continued evolution of its business.

Although Milestone Scientific believes that its assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove inaccurate. Considering the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, our history of operating losses that are expected to continue, requiring additional funding that we may be unable to raise capital when needed (which may force us to delay, curtail or eliminate commercialization efforts of our CompuFlo Epidural Computer Controlled Anesthesia System), the early stage operations of and relative lack of acceptance of our medical products, relying exclusively on two third parties to manufacture our products, changes to our distribution arrangements exposes us to risks of interruption of marketing efforts and building new marketing channels, changes in our informal manufacturing arrangements made by the manufacturer of our products and disruptions at the manufacturing facility of our manufacturers, including shortages of or delays in obtaining chips and other components, exposes us to risks that may harm our business, raising additional funds by issuing securities or through licensing or lending arrangements may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights, if physicians do not accept or use our CompuFlo Epidural Computer Controlled Anesthesia System, our ability to generate revenue from sales will be materially impaired, exposure to the risks inherent in international sales and operations, including China, and developments by competitors may render our products or technologies obsolete or non-competitive, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by Milestone Scientific or any other person that the objectives and plans of Milestone Scientific will be achieved. Prospective investors are cautioned that any forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties and the actual results may differ materially from those included within the forward-looking statements because of various factors. Except as required by the federal securities laws, Milestone Scientific undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

other countries. Milestone Scientific also has 510 (k) marketing clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the CompuFlo Epidural Computer Controlled Anesthesia System in the lumbar thoracic and cervical thoracic junction of the spinal region. 
 
 The Company current marketing focus is self-distribution using its e-commerce platform; however, it is also in the process of meeting with medical facilities and device distributors within the United States, Middle East and Europe so as to develop other channels of distribution. Certain of our medical instruments have obtained European CE mark approval and can be marketed and sold in most European countries. 

million. The operating losses were million and million, for three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 . On September 30, 2024 , Milestone Scientific had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and working capital of approximately million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , and 2023 , we had cash flows used in operating activities of approximately million and million respectively. 
 
 Management has prepared financial forecasts covering a period of 12 months from the date of issuance of these financial statements. These forecasts include several revenue and operating expense assumptions which indicate that the Company s current cash and liquidity is sufficient to finance the operating requirements for at least the next 12 months from the filing date. 
 
 Milestone Scientific is actively pursuing the generation of positive cash flows from operating activities through an increase in revenue from its dental business worldwide, the generation of revenue from its medical devices and disposables business in the United States and worldwide, and a reduction in operating expenses. However, the Company s continued operations will depend on its ability to raise additional capital through various potential sources until it achieves profitability, if ever. 
 
 In addition to its employees, the Company relies on (i) distributors, agents, and third -party logistics providers in connection with product sales and distribution and (ii) raw material and component suppliers in the U.S., Europe, and China. If the Company, or any of these entities encounter any disruptions to its or their respective operations or facilities, or if the Company or any of these third -party partners were to shut down for any reason, including by fire, natural disaster, such as a hurricane, tornado or severe storm, power outage, systems failure, labor dispute, pandemic or other public health crises, or other unforeseen disruption, then the Company or they may be prevented or delayed from effectively operating its or their business, respectively.

i. identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; 
 ii. determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; 
 iii. measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; 
 iv. allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations based on estimated selling prices; and 
 v. recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account in ASC 606. 

The Company derives its revenues from the sale of its products, primarily dental instruments, handpieces, and other related products. The Company sells its products directly to consumers in the United States and through a global distribution network that includes both exclusive and non-exclusive distribution agreements with related and third parties. 
 
 Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of a product to a customer, generally upon date of shipment. The Company has no obligation on product sales for any installation, set-up, or maintenance, these being the responsibility of the buyer. Milestone Scientific's only obligation after sale is the normal commercial warranty against manufacturing defects if the alleged defective unit is returned within the warranty period. 
 
 E-Commerce 
 
 As of January 3, 2023, the Company launched an E-Commerce platform, selling and shipping STA Single Tooth Anesthesia Systems (STA) and handpieces directly to dental offices and dental groups within the United States. Our E-commerce portal accepts online payments via credit and debit cards. The cost of delivery is charged to the customer along with appropriate sales tax. The Company recognizes revenue from product sales at the time the product ships to a customer via a third -party carrier. 
 
 Sales Returns 
 
 The Company records allowances for product returns as a reduction of revenue at the time product sales are recorded. Several factors are considered in determining whether an allowance for product returns is required, including the customers return rights and the Company s historical experience with returns and the amount of product in the distribution channel not consumed by end users and subject to return. The Company relies on historical return rates to estimate returns. 
 
 Financing and Payment 
 
 The Company's payment terms differ by geography and customer, but payments from distributors are required within 90 days or less from the date of shipment. The E-commerce portal sells directly to end users and accepts online payments via credit and debit cards via a third -party. These payments from the third party are typically settled within two business days. 
 
 Disaggregation of Revenue 
 
 The Company operates in operating segments: dental and medical. Therefore, the results of the Company's operations are reported on a consolidated basis for the purposes of segment reporting, consistent with internal management reporting. See Note 8 for revenues by geographical market, based on the customer s location, and product category for the three and nine months periods ended September 30, 2024 , and 2023 , respectively. 
 
 million and million, respectively of cash and cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2024 , Milestone Scientific had approximately million in cash, cash equivalents, in accounts that exceeded the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limit of 250,000.

 , respectively. 

and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. The calculation of diluted earnings per common share is like that of basic earnings per common share, except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if all potentially dilutive common shares, such as those issuable upon the exercise of stock options and warrants, were issued during the period. Since Milestone Scientific had net losses in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , the assumed effects of the exercise of potentially dilutive outstanding stock options, unissued restricted stock awards RSA and warrants, were not included in the calculation as their effect would have been anti-dilutive. Such outstanding options, RSA's and warrants t otaled and fo r the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. 

Financial assets and liabilities are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of an input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of the fair value of assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 the Company did not have assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis. As of December 31, 2023 the Company had the following assets that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis: 

Marketable Securities included US Treasury securities totaling that are considered to be highly liquid and easily transferable at December 31, 2023 . US Treasury securities are valued using inputs observable in active markets for identical securities and are therefore classified at Level 1 within the Company fair value hierarchy.

 OVERVIEW 
 
 Milestone Scientific is a biomedical technology company that patents, designs, develops and commercializes innovative diagnostic and therapeutic injection technologies and devices for medical and dental use. Since our inception, we have engaged in pioneering proprietary, innovative, computer-controlled injection technologies, and solutions for the medical and dental markets. We believe our technologies are proven and well established. Our common stock has been listed on the NYSE American since June 1, 2015, and trades under the symbol MLSS . 
 
 We focus our resources on redefining the worldwide standard of care for injection techniques to make the experience more comfortable for the patient by reducing the anxiety and stress of receiving injections from the healthcare provider. Our computer-controlled injection devices make injections precise, efficient, and virtually painless. 
 
 We have developed a proprietary, revolutionary, computer-controlled anesthetic delivery device, our DPS Dynamic Pressure Sensing Technology System, to meet the needs of various subcutaneous drug delivery injections and fluid aspiration enabling healthcare practitioners to achieve multiple unique benefits that cannot currently be accomplished with the 160-year-old manual syringe. Our proprietary DPS Dynamic Pressure Sensing technology is our technology platform that advances the development of next-generation devices. It regulates the flow rate and monitors the pressure from the tip of the needle, through platform extensions for local anesthesia for subcutaneous drug delivery, used in various dental and medical injections. It has specific medical applications for epidural space identification in regional anesthesia procedures. 
 
 Our device, using The Wand , a single use disposable handpiece, is marketed in dentistry under the trademark CompuDent , and STA Single Tooth Anesthesia System and is suitable for all dental procedures that require local anesthetic. The dental devices currently are sold in the United States, Canada and in over 41 other countries. Milestone Scientific also has 510(k) marketing clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the CompuFlo Epidural Computer Controlled Anesthesia System in the lumbar, thoracic and cervical thoracic junction of the spine region. In addition, Milestone Scientific has obtained CE mark approval and can be marketed and sold in most European countries. 
 
 Our recent receipt of the chronology-Specific CPT Code for the Company's technology by the American Medical Association marks an important milestone, that could increase the potential number of anesthesia pain management clinics adopting the CompuFlo instrument. A CPT code expands the potential for reimbursement of epidural procedures in pain management utilizing the CompuFlo Epidural System, which should help accelerate the commercial roll-out of CompuFlo in the U.S 
 
 Milestone Scientific and its subsidiaries currently hold over 245 U.S. and foreign patents, and many patents pending and patent applications. The Company s patents and patent applications relate to drug delivery methodologies, Peripheral Nerve Block, drug flow rate measurement, pressure/force computer-controlled drug delivery with exit pressure, dynamic pressure sensing, automated rate control, automated charging, drug profiles, audible and visual pressure/force feedback, tissue identification, identification of a target region drug delivery injection unit, drug drive unit for anesthetic, handpiece, and injection device. 
 
 Milestone Scientific remains focused on advancing efforts to achieve the following three primary objectives: 

Establishing Milestone s DPS Dynamic Pressure Sensing technology platform as the standard-of-care in painless and precise drug delivery, providing for the first time, objective visual and audible in-tissue pressure feedback, and continuing to expand platform applications; 

Following obtaining successful FDA clearance of our first medical device, Milestone Scientific is transitioning from a research and development organization to a commercially focused medical device company; and 

22

Expanding our global footprint of our CompuFlo Epidural and CathCheck System by utilizing a targeted field sales force and partnering with distribution companies worldwide. 

Our dental devices have been used to administer over 92 million injections worldwide. Each of our devices has a related single use disposable handpiece, leading to a continuing revenue stream following the sale of the device. At present, we sell disposable handpieces unique to our legacy product (the Wand and CompuDent) to users who have not upgraded to our current dental product, the STA Single Tooth Anesthesia System. 
 
 Building on the success of our proprietary, core technology platform for dental injections, and desiring to pursue other growth opportunities, we have begun to expand the uses and applications of our proprietary, patented technologies to achieve greater operational efficiencies, enhanced patient safety and therapeutic adherence, patient satisfaction, and improved quality of care across a broad range of medical specialties. 
 
 We intend to continue to expand the uses and applications of our DPS Dynamic Pressure Sensing technology. We believe that we and our technology solutions are recognized by key opinion leaders (i.e., academics, anesthesiologists and practicing dentists whose opinions are widely respected), industry experts and medical and dental practitioners as a leader in the emerging, computer-controlled injection industry. 
 
 The Single Tooth Anesthesia System (Dental) 
 
 Since its market introduction in early 2007, the STA Single Tooth Anesthesia System and prior C-CLAD devices have been used to deliver over 92 million safe, effective, and comfortable injections. The instrument has also been favorably evaluated in numerous peer-reviewed, published clinical studies and associated articles. Moreover, there appears to be a growing consensus among users that the STA Instrument is proving to be a valuable and beneficial instrument that is positively impacting the practice of dentistry worldwide.

Operating Activities 
 
 Cash flows used in operating activities decreased of 2.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by the Company s receipt of approximately 2.0 million, net of expenses, from the sale of New Jersey net operating losses (NOL ), that were eligible for sale under the State of New Jersey s Economic Development Authority s New Jersey Technology Business Tax Certificate Transfer program NJEDA Program ). 

28

Investing Activities 
 
 Cash flows provided by investing activities increased 5.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023. The Company sold 3.0 million of marketable securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 which increased cash and equivalents by 3.0 million. The Company purchased approximately 2.5 million in marketable security during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023 increased by approximately 0.2 primarily due to the issuance of additional shares of the Company s common stock due to a Public Placement Offering. 
 
 Consideration of Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 The Company has evaluated whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the consolidated financial statements are issued. The Company has incurred total losses since inception of 126.0 million. The operating losses were 1.5 million and 4.7 million, for three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 . On September 30, 2024 , Milestone Scientific had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 4.8 million and working capital of approximately 6.9 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , and 2023 , we had cash flows used in operating activities of approximately 1.4 million and 4.1 million respectively. 
 
 In April 2024, we received approximately 2.0 million, net of expenses, from the sale of New Jersey net operating losses NOL ), that were eligible for sale under the State of New Jersey s Economic Development Authority s New Jersey Technology Business Tax Certificate Transfer program NJEDA Program ). 
 
 Management has prepared financial forecasts covering a period of 12 months from the date of issuance of these financial statements. These forecasts include several revenue and operating expense assumptions which indicate that the Company s current cash and liquidity is sufficient to finance the operating requirements for at least the next 12 months from the filing date. Milestone Scientific is actively pursuing the generation of positive cash flows from operating activities through an increase in revenue from its dental business worldwide, the generation of revenue from its medical devices and disposables business in the United States and worldwide, and a reduction in operating expenses. However, the Company s continued operations will depend on its ability to raise additional capital through various potential sources until it achieves profitability, if ever. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 Milestone Scientific is a smaller reporting company as defined by Regulation S-K and, as such, is not required to provide the information required by this item. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Accounting Officer, both positions being held by the same person, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 
 
 Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, as ours are designed to do, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Accounting Officer, concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.
