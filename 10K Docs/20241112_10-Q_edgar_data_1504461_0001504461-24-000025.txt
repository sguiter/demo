 segments: 
 
 Our Water Solutions segment transports, treats, recycles and disposes of produced and flowback water generated from crude oil and natural gas production. We also sell produced water for reuse and recycle and brackish non-potable water to our producer customers to be used in their crude oil exploration and production activities. As part of processing water, we aggregate and sell recovered crude oil, also known as skim oil. We also dispose of solids such as tank bottoms, drilling fluids and drilling muds and perform other ancillary services such as truck and frac tank washouts. Our activities in this segment are underpinned by long-term, fixed fee contracts and acreage dedications, some of which contain minimum volume commitments with leading oil and gas companies including large, investment grade producer customers. 
 Our Crude Oil Logistics segment purchases crude oil from producers and marketers and transports it to refineries or for resale at pipeline injection stations, storage terminals, barge loading facilities, rail facilities, refineries, and other trade hubs, and provides storage, terminaling, and transportation services through its owned assets. Our activities in this segment are supported by certain long-term, fixed rate contracts which include minimum volume commitments on our storage tanks and owned and leased pipelines. 
 Our Liquids Logistics segment conducts supply operations for natural gas liquids, refined petroleum products and biodiesel to a broad range of commercial, retail and industrial customers across the United States and Canada. These operations are conducted through our owned terminals, third-party storage and terminal facilities, common carrier pipelines and a fleet of leased railcars. We also provide services for marine exports of butane through our facility located in Chesapeake, Virginia and we also own a propane pipeline in Michigan. We attempt to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations by using back-to-back physical contracts and pre-sale agreements that allow us to lock in a margin on a percentage of our winter volumes. We also enter into financially settled derivative contracts as economic hedges of our physical inventory, physical sales and physical purchase contracts.

Significant Accounting Policies

 million and million at September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively, as a result of acquiring corporations in connection with certain of our acquisitions, which is included within other noncurrent liabilities in our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. The decrease in the deferred tax liability during the six months ended September 30, 2024 was due to the sale of our ranches in April 2024, one ranch of which was treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes (see Note 15). The deferred tax liability is the tax effected cumulative temporary difference between the GAAP basis and tax basis of the acquired assets within the corporation. For GAAP purposes, certain of the acquired assets will be depreciated and amortized over time which will lower the GAAP basis. The deferred tax benefit recorded during the six months ended September 30, 2024 was million with an effective tax rate of . The deferred tax benefit recorded during the six months ended September 30, 2023 was million with an effective tax rate of . 
 
 We evaluate uncertain tax positions for recognition and measurement in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. To recognize a tax position, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on the technical merits of the position. A tax position that meets the more likely than not threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. We had uncertain tax positions that required recognition in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements at September 30, 2024 or March 31, 2024.

 Amounts in the table above do not include accrued expenses and other payables related to the sale of certain freshwater water solutions facilities, as these amounts have been classified as liabilities held for sale within our March 31, 2024 consolidated balance sheet (see Note 15). 

During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we created a new aviation entity whereby we own a interest and a member of our management owns a interest as discussed in Note 15. We also executed a guarantee for the benefit of the lender that obligates us for the payment and performance of the aviation entity with respect to the repayment of the loan. Since we guaranteed the payment of the outstanding loan, we have concluded that the aviation entity is a VIE because the equity is not sufficient to fund the aviation entity s activities without additional subordinated financial support. We have the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the aviation entity and have benefits through our ownership interest. Therefore, we have concluded that we are the primary beneficiary and will consolidate the aviation entity in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and will include the noncontrolling interest as redeemable noncontrolling interest as discussed below.

 Generally, the assets of the VIE can be used only to settle liabilities of the VIE and the liabilities of the VIE are liabilities for which creditors or beneficial interest holders do not have recourse to the general credit of the Partnership. In general, our maximum exposure to loss due to involvement with the VIE is limited to the amount of capital investment in the VIE, if any, or the potential obligation to perform on the guarantee of the outstanding loan.

 million , which is recorded within accrued expenses and other payables in our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet. Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. Although we believe our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, risks of additional costs and liabilities are inherent in our businesses, and there can be no assurance that we will not incur significant costs. Moreover, it is possible that other developments, such as increasingly stringent environmental laws, regulations and enforcement policies thereunder, and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from the operations, could result in substantial costs. Accordingly, we have adopted policies, practices, and procedures in the areas of pollution control, product safety, occupational health, and the handling, storage, use, and disposal of hazardous materials designed to prevent material environmental or other damage, and to limit the financial liability that could result from such events. However, some risk of environmental or other damage is inherent in our businesses.

At September 30, 2024, our primary counterparties were retailers, resellers, energy marketers, producers, refiners, and dealers. This concentration of counterparties may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, as the counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in economic, regulatory or other conditions. If a counterparty does not perform on a contract, we may not realize amounts that have been recorded in our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets and recognized in our net income.

 Items Impacting the Comparability of Our Financial Results 
 
 Our current and future results of operations may not be comparable to our historical results of operations for the periods presented due to commodity price volatility, demand fluctuations, acquisitions, dispositions and other transactions. Our results of operations for the three months and six months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for future periods or for the full fiscal year ending March 31, 2025.

Recent Developments 
 
 Dispositions 
 
 Disposition transactions impact the comparability of our results of operations between our current and prior fiscal years. See Note 15 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for a discussion of dispositions that occurred during the current fiscal year. 

Other Developments 
 
 Global Pandemic, International Conflicts and Market Update 
 
 Since March 2020, and throughout the last four years, global markets and commodity prices have been extremely volatile due to the impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, with further impacts on volatility caused by the war in Ukraine that began in February 2022, the current conflict between Israel and Hamas that began in October 2023 and conflicts involving Iran and its proxy forces. While we have seen continued recovery in commodity prices since the beginning of the pandemic, there is still volatility that we expect to continue at least for the near-term and possibly longer, due to these conflicts. This volatility could result in economic recession or depression and negatively impact future prices for crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products and industrial products. 
 
 In addition, if we see a continuation or acceleration of inflationary conditions, rising interest rates, supply chain disruptions and tight labor markets, we may also see higher costs of operating our assets and executing on our capital projects in fiscal year 2025. In an effort to curb inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates during fiscal year 2023, in May 2023 and most recently in July 2023. If the U.S. Federal Reserve implements additional increases, costs under our variable-rate debt and preferred units will increase (see Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk included in this Quarterly Report). On the other hand, our ability to pass along rate increases reflecting changes in producer and/or consumer price indices to our customers, under our contracts, should help to counterbalance the impact of inflation on our costs. 
 
 Seismic Activity 
 
 The subsurface injection of produced water for disposal has been associated with induced seismic events in Texas and New Mexico. While these events have been of relatively low magnitude, industry and relevant state regulators are, nevertheless, taking proactive measures to attempt to prevent similar induced seismic events. More specifically, we are engaged in various collaborative industry efforts with other disposal operators and relevant state regulatory agencies, working to collect and review data, enhance understanding of regional fault systems, and ultimately develop and implement appropriate longer-term mitigation strategies. As part of this effort, we have implemented reductions in injected volumes at certain facilities, and where appropriate have temporarily shut-in facilities. To date, due to the capacity of our integrated system in the affected areas, the diverse locations of our disposal facilities, and the connectivity of our system, our ability to dispose of produced water has not been materially impacted by these actions, and with our unique positioning outside of the affected areas, we have the ability to grow our asset base. 
 
 Regulatory Developments 
 
 On March 6, 2024, the SEC adopted a new set of rules that require a wide range of climate-related disclosures, including material climate-related risks, information on any climate-related targets or goals that are material to the registrant s business, results of operations, or financial condition, Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions on a phased-in basis by certain larger registrants when those emissions are material and the filing of an attestation report covering the same, and disclosure of the financial statement effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions including costs and losses. Compliance dates under the final rule are phased in by registrant category. Multiple lawsuits have been filed challenging the SEC s new climate rules, which have been consolidated and will be heard in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. On April 4, 2024, the SEC issued an order staying the final rules until judicial review is complete.

Segment Operating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Water Solutions 
 
 The following table summarizes the operating results of our Water Solutions segment for the periods indicated: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change (in thousands, except per barrel and per day amounts) Revenues: Water disposal service fees 148,241 154,751 (6,510) Sale of recovered crude oil 24,708 31,101 (6,393) Recycled water 679 947 (268) Other revenues 8,239 10,445 (2,206) Total revenues 181,867 197,244 (15,377) Expenses: Cost of sales-excluding impact of derivatives 1,752 2,952 (1,200) Derivative (gain) loss (2,319) 4,472 (6,791) Operating expenses 53,611 53,867 (256) General and administrative expenses 1,520 1,183 337 Depreciation and amortization expense 52,523 52,053 470 Loss on disposal or impairment of assets, net 1,951 23,599 (21,648) Total expenses 109,038 138,126 (29,088) Segment operating income 72,829 59,118 13,711 Produced water processed (barrels per day) Delaware Basin 2,349,333 2,156,733 192,600 Eagle Ford Basin 188,250 138,509 49,741 DJ Basin 143,947 146,124 (2,177) Total 2,681,530 2,441,366 240,164 Recycled water (barrels per day) 92,301 35,341 56,960 Total (barrels per day) 2,773,831 2,476,707 297,124 Skim oil sold (barrels per day) (1) 3,776 4,378 (602) Service fees for produced water processed /barrel) (2)(3) 0.60 0.69 (0.09) Recovered crude oil for produced water processed /barrel) (2) 0.10 0.14 (0.04) Operating expenses for produced water processed /barrel) (2) 0.22 0.24 (0.02) 
 
 (1) As of June 30, 2023, approximately 53,000 barrels of skim oil were stored and were sold during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 (2) Total produced water barrels processed during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 246,700,755 and 224,605,594, respectively. These amounts do not include 7,693,542 barrels and 20,763,928 barrels for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to payments received from producers for committed volumes not delivered, as discussed further below. 
 (3) Excluding payments made by certain producers for committed volumes not delivered and the one-time item discussed below, service fees for produced water processed /barrel) would have been 0.59/barrel and 0.62/barrel during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Water Disposal Service Fee Revenues. During July 2023, we entered into a transaction in which a portion of the total consideration received was allocated to revenue due to the termination of a minimum volume water disposal contract. Also, revenue was higher in the prior year quarter due to the timing and recognition of payments made by certain producers for committed volumes not delivered. Excluding these items, revenue increased due primarily to an increase in produced water volumes processed from contracted customers and higher fees charged for interruptible spot volumes. These increases were partially offset by lower fees for produced water processed during the quarter due to rate changes for certain existing contracts, the expiration of certain higher fee per barrel contracts which were replaced with lower fee per barrel contracts with an extended term and higher volumes received under contracts with lower fees per barrel. 
 
 Recovered Crude Oil Revenues. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in skim oil barrels sold as a result of lower skim oil recovered as certain producers recycled their water for use in their operations, lower realized crude oil prices 
 38 

Table of Contents 

received from the sale of skim oil barrels and the sale during the prior year quarter of approximately 53,000 barrels of skim oil that were stored at June 30, 2023 due to tighter pipeline specifications. 
 
 Recycled Water Revenues. Revenue from recycled water includes the sale of produced water and recycled water for use in our customers completion activities. The decrease was due primarily to lower pricing for recycled water, partially offset by an increase in recycled water volumes related to timing of water to be used in completions. 
 
 Other Revenues. Other revenues primarily include reimbursements from construction projects, booster operating fees and generator rentals, water pipeline revenues, solids disposal revenues, land surface use revenues and brackish non-potable water revenues. The decrease was due primarily to lower land surface use revenues, mining revenues and lease revenue from certain surface use and compensation agreements primarily due to the sale of our ranches in April 2024 (see Note 15 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report). We also had lower reimbursements from construction projects. These decreases were partially offset by higher reimbursements from booster operating fees and generator rentals. 
 
 Cost of Sales-Excluding Impact of Derivatives . The decrease was due primarily to lower third-party disposal fees, lower recycling costs and lower trucking expenses related to skim oil sales. 
 
 Derivative (Gain) Loss . We enter into derivatives in our Water Solutions segment to protect against the risk of a decline in the market price of the crude oil we expect to recover when processing produced water and selling recovered skim oil. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had 0.4 million of net unrealized losses on derivatives and 2.7 million of net realized gains on derivatives. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had 4.5 million of net unrealized losses on derivatives and less than 0.1 million of net realized losses on derivatives. 
 
 Operating and General and Administrative Expenses . The increase was due primarily to higher business insurance expense for remediation costs incurred, higher utilities expense due to increased produced water volumes processed and lower severance taxes in the prior year quarter as a result of a severance tax refund received in September 2023 that related to prior periods. These increases were partially offset by lower chemical expense due to purchasing fewer chemicals and using chemicals more efficiently and lower repairs and maintenance expense due to the timing of repairs and tank cleaning. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense . The increase was due primarily to depreciation of newly developed facilities and infrastructure, partially offset by certain long-term assets being fully amortized, impaired or sold during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 and six months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Loss on Disposal or Impairment of Assets, Net. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a net loss of 3.5 million primarily related to the write down of the value of certain saltwater disposal wells as well as abandonment of certain capital projects and the retirement of certain other assets. In addition, we recorded a gain of 1.5 million from insurance recoveries for certain saltwater disposal facilities and boosters damaged in a prior period. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a net loss of 21.2 million primarily related to the sale of certain assets and a net loss of 2.4 million related to the abandonment of certain capital projects and the retirement of certain assets.

Crude Oil Logistics 
 
 The following table summarizes the operating results of our Crude Oil Logistics segment for the periods indicated: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change (in thousands, except per barrel amounts) Revenues: Crude oil sales 225,013 475,103 (250,090) Crude oil transportation and other sales 18,828 14,747 4,081 Total revenues (1) 243,841 489,850 (246,009) Expenses: Cost of sales-excluding impact of derivatives 216,593 439,698 (223,105) Derivative (gain) loss (4,361) 15,366 (19,727) Operating expenses 10,249 9,946 303 General and administrative expenses 677 956 (279) Depreciation and amortization expense 6,285 9,573 (3,288) Gain on disposal or impairment of assets, net (442) (467) 25 Total expenses 229,001 475,072 (246,071) Segment operating income 14,840 14,778 62 Crude oil sold (barrels) 2,868 5,636 (2,768) Crude oil transported on owned pipelines (barrels) 5,807 6,484 (677) Crude oil storage capacity - owned and leased (barrels) (2) 5,232 5,232 Crude oil storage capacity leased to third-parties (barrels) (2) 1,650 2,250 (600) Crude oil inventory (barrels) (2) 450 660 (210) Crude oil sold /barrel) 78.456 84.298 (5.842) Cost per crude oil sold /barrel) (3) 75.521 78.016 (2.495) Crude oil product margin /barrel) (3) 2.935 6.282 (3.347) 
 
 (1) Revenues include 0.1 million and 0.1 million of intersegment sales during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, that are eliminated in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 (2) Information is presented as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 (3) Cost and product margin per barrel excludes the impact of derivatives. 
 
 Crude Oil Sales and Cost of Sales-Excluding Impact of Derivatives. The decreases in sales and cost of sales, excluding the impact of derivatives, were due primarily to lower sales volumes due to lower production on acreage dedicated to us in the DJ Basin during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Lower crude oil prices also contributed to the decrease. 
 
 The decrease in the crude oil product margin was primarily due to lower contracted volumes purchased and sold year over year as discussed above. Crude oil product margin per barrel decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the sale of higher priced inventory into a market in which prices were declining, whereas during the three months ended September 30, 2023, we experienced the opposite in which we were selling lower priced inventory into a market in which prices were increasing. This decrease is partially offset by higher price and quality differentials realized in the current period compared to the prior period. Crude oil product margin calculations do not include gains and losses from derivatives that may offset the movement in the physical margin. 
 
 Derivative (Gain) Loss. Our cost of sales during the three months ended September 30, 2024 included 0.3 million of net realized gains on derivatives and 4.0 million of net unrealized gains on derivatives. Our cost of sales during the three months ended September 30, 2023 included 10.8 million of net realized losses on derivatives and 4.6 million of net unrealized losses on derivatives. The amounts for the three months ended September 30, 2023 included net realized gains of 9.4 million and net unrealized losses of 4.8 million associated with derivative instruments related to our hedge of the CMA Differential Roll, defined and discussed below under Non-GAAP Financial Measures. The CMA hedge expired as of December 31, 2023 and we did not enter into another hedge.

Crude Oil Transportation and Other Sales. The increase was primarily due to higher tariff revenue on the Grand Mesa Pipeline as a result of signing on a new shipper during the open season that ended January 5, 2024. Additionally, the three months ended September 30, 2024 also benefited from higher terminaling revenue from an acreage dedication in the Eagle Ford Basin as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. These increases were partially offset by lower storage fees at our Cushing terminal during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior period. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, physical volumes on the Grand Mesa Pipeline averaged approximately 63,000 barrels per day, compared to approximately 70,000 barrels per day during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Lower contracted volumes were shipped on the Grand Mesa Pipeline due to lower production on acreage dedicated to us in the DJ Basin. 
 
 Operating and General and Administrative Expenses . The increase was primarily due to higher ad valorem taxes due to higher assessed values on our Grand Mesa Pipeline assets in the State of Colorado, which we are currently protesting, and higher compensation expense incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024. These increases were partially offset by lower utilities expense on the Grand Mesa Pipeline and at our Cushing terminal due to lower volumes flowing through the system during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense. The decrease was primarily due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated during the year ended March 31, 2024. 
 
 Gain on Disposal or Impairment of Assets, Net . During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a net gain of 0.4 million primarily due to a gain on the sale of certain assets. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a net gain of 0.5 million primarily due to disposals and retirements of certain real estate assets.

 Refined Products Sales and Cost of Sales-Excluding Impact of Derivatives. The decreases in sales and cost of sales, excluding the impact of derivatives, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to lower prices during the current quarter and a decrease in volumes due to lower demand. 
 
 Refined Products product margins, excluding the impact of derivatives, decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2024. This decrease was primarily related to lower commodity prices, aggressive prices in the market from our competitors and lower volumes in some key markets due to supplier issues. 
 
 Refined Products Derivative (Gain) Loss. Our Refined Products product margin during the three months ended September 30, 2024 included realized gains of less than 0.1 million and the three months ended September 30, 2023 included realized losses of 0.1 million. 
 
 Propane Sales and Cost of Sales-Excluding Impact of Derivatives. The decreases in sales and cost of sales, excluding the impact of derivatives, were due primarily to lower volumes. Volumes decreased due to lower contracted volumes during the three months ended September 30, 2024, due to reduced retail customer demand. This decrease was partially offset by higher average propane prices during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Propane product margins, excluding the impact of derivatives, decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to lower volumes and selling higher priced inventory into a market in which prices were declining. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we sold lower priced inventory into a market in which prices were increasing. Also, we incurred higher than anticipated costs to clean and repair railcars coming off lease during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Propane Derivative (Gain) Loss. Our cost of propane sales during the three months ended September 30, 2024 included net unrealized losses of 1.1 million on derivatives and 2.6 million of net realized gains on derivatives. Our cost of propane sales during the three months ended September 30, 2023 included 0.9 million of net unrealized gains on derivatives

and 3.7 million of net realized losses on derivatives. 
 
 Butane Sales and Cost of Sales-Excluding Impact of Derivatives. The increases in sales and cost of sales, excluding the impact of derivatives, were primarily due to increased commodity prices during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to prices during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was also due to a strong start to the gasoline blending season and stronger exports during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Butane product margins, excluding the impact of derivatives, decreased primarily due to the prior year period benefiting from a lower of cost or realizable value adjustment recorded during the three months ended June 30, 2023. Excluding this adjustment, margins increased due to increased commodity prices and volumes during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Butane Derivative Loss. Our cost of butane sales during the three months ended September 30, 2024 included 5.2 million of net unrealized losses on derivatives and 0.3 million of net realized losses on derivatives. Our cost of butane sales during the three months ended September 30, 2023 included 4.5 million of net unrealized losses on derivatives and 3.1 million of net realized gains on derivatives. 
 
 Other Products Sales and Cost of Sales-Excluding Impact of Derivatives. The decreases in sales and cost of sales, excluding the impact of derivatives, were due to a decrease in commodity prices, primarily biodiesel prices and prices for renewable identification numbers RINs ), during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the three months ended September 30, 2023. This was offset by increased biodiesel volumes and increased sales of asphalt due to consistent supply of product compared to the prior year. 
 
 Other products sales product margins, excluding the impact of derivatives, decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to selling higher priced biodiesel inventory into a market in which prices were declining. We had entered into long-term biodiesel contracts in the prior year, when the prices were higher, for delivery in the current period. 
 
 Other Products Derivative Gain. Our derivatives of other products during the three months ended September 30, 2024 included 2.9 million of net unrealized losses on derivatives and 9.4 million of net realized gains on derivatives. Our derivatives of other products during the three months ended September 30, 2023 included 0.5 million of net unrealized gains on derivatives and 6.4 million of net realized gains on derivatives. 
 
 Service Sales and Cost of Sales. The sales includes storage, terminaling and transportation services income. Terminal sales and cost of sales decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to the timing of volumes received under a six-month throughput volume commitment, as higher volumes were received during the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year period. 
 
 Operating and General and Administrative Expenses . The increase during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023 is due primarily to an increase to the provision for expected credit losses and an increase in sales commissions. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense . Depreciation and amortization expense remained consistent year over year. 
 
 Gain on Disposal or Impairment of Assets, Net . During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a net gain of 6.9 million on the sale of two terminals in July 2023.

Corporate and Other 
 
 The operating loss within Corporate and Other includes the following components for the periods indicated: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change (in thousands) Other Revenues Service revenues 74 74 Cost of sales Derivative gain (3,381) 3,381 Expenses: General and administrative expenses 8,179 13,307 (5,128) Depreciation and amortization expense 702 1,517 (815) Total expenses 8,881 14,824 (5,943) Operating loss (8,807) (11,443) 2,636 
 
 Service Revenues. These revenues relate to payments made by the noncontrolling interest holder for usage of the airplane acquired in June 2024. 
 
 Cost of Sales - Derivative Gain. Our cost of sales during the three months ended September 30, 2023 included 0.8 million of net realized gains on derivatives and 2.6 million of net unrealized gains on derivatives. We entered into economic hedges to protect our liquidity positions and leverage from a significant increase in commodity prices that drive our working capital demands. There were no open hedge positions that would impact cost of sales as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 General and Administrative Expenses. The expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased due to lower legal expenses as several large cases ended, the reimbursement of legal expenses relating to a dispute associated with commercial activities in prior periods and lower compensation expense due to the elimination of share-based compensation expense due to all outstanding long-term incentive plan awards being fully vested in November 2023. Business insurance was also lower for the period, as we paid an insurance company to be released from any future supplementary calls on our indemnity policy related to our former crude marine business (which was sold on March 30, 2023) during the three months ended September 30, 2023, as well as accruing for higher claims in the prior year. These decreases were partially offset by higher incentive compensation expense. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense. The decrease during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was due to software that became fully depreciated during the year ended March 31, 2024. 

Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Entities 
 
 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities was 1.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 0.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was due primarily to higher earnings from certain membership interests related to specific land and water services operations and a lower loss from our interest in an aircraft company which was dissolved on April 30, 2024.

Interest Expense 
 
 The following table summarizes the components of our consolidated interest expense for the periods indicated: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change (in thousands) Senior secured notes 45,500 38,437 7,063 Senior secured term loan B credit facility Term Loan B 16,668 16,668 ABL Facility 6,401 5,203 1,198 Senior unsecured notes 10,297 (10,297) Other indebtedness (70) 554 (624) Total debt interest expense 68,499 54,491 14,008 Amortization of debt issuance costs 2,929 4,136 (1,207) Unrealized loss on interest rate swaps 7,027 7,027 Realized gain on interest rate swaps (1,051) (1,051) Total interest expense 77,404 58,627 18,777 
 
 The debt interest expense increased 14.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to higher interest rates on Term Loan B, the 900.0 million of 8.125 senior secured notes that mature on February 15, 2029 2029 Senior Secured Notes and the 1.3 billion of 8.375 senior secured notes that mature on February 15, 2032 2032 Senior Secured Notes ). 

Gain on Early Extinguishment of Liabilities, Net 
 
 Gain on early extinguishment of liabilities, net of 0.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of debt issuance costs previously written off that were reversed. We did not repurchase any debt during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Other Income, Net 
 
 Other income, net of 1.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of an unrealized gain on an investment and interest income on loan receivables. Other income, net of 0.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 consisted primarily of interest income on loan receivables (see Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for a further discussion). 

Income Tax Expense 
 
 Income tax expense was 0.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to income tax expense of 0.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. See Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for a further discussion. 

Noncontrolling Interests - Redeemable and Nonredeemable 
 
 Noncontrolling interests represent the portion of certain consolidated subsidiaries that are owned by third-parties. Noncontrolling interest income was 0.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 0.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was due primarily to higher income from certain water solutions operations.

 Water Solutions 
 
 The following table summarizes the operating results of our Water Solutions segment for the periods indicated: 
 Six Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change (in thousands, except per barrel and per day amounts) Revenues: Water disposal service fees 289,239 297,703 (8,464) Sale of recovered crude oil 55,484 54,118 1,366 Recycled water 2,939 5,167 (2,228) Other revenues 15,615 21,558 (5,943) Total revenues 363,277 378,546 (15,269) Expenses: Cost of sales-excluding impact of derivatives 3,577 5,521 (1,944) Derivative (gain) loss (3,144) 4,472 (7,616) Operating expenses 106,436 108,949 (2,513) General and administrative expenses 2,731 2,361 370 Depreciation and amortization expense 105,235 106,476 (1,241) (Gain) loss on disposal or impairment of assets, net (8,745) 22,318 (31,063) Total expenses 206,090 250,097 (44,007) Segment operating income 157,187 128,449 28,738 Produced water processed (barrels per day) Delaware Basin 2,255,861 2,154,906 100,955 Eagle Ford Basin 182,311 135,737 46,574 DJ Basin 135,867 157,745 (21,878) Other Basins 1,481 (1,481) Total 2,574,039 2,449,869 124,170 Recycled water (barrels per day) 98,334 67,213 31,121 Total (barrels per day) 2,672,373 2,517,082 155,291 Skim oil sold (barrels per day) (1) 4,099 4,046 53 Service fees for produced water processed /barrel) (2)(3) 0.61 0.66 (0.05) Recovered crude oil for produced water processed /barrel) (2) 0.12 0.12 Operating expenses for produced water processed /barrel) (2) 0.23 0.24 (0.01) 
 (1) As of March 31, 2023, approximately 34,380 barrels of skim oil were stored and were sold during the six months ended September 30, 2023. 
 (2) Total produced water barrels processed during the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 471,049,065 and 448,325,889, respectively. These amounts do not include 19,393,348 barrels and 23,873,967 barrels for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to payments received from producers for committed volumes not delivered, as discussed further below. 
 (3) Excluding the one-time item discussed below, service fees for produced water processed /barrel) would have been 0.64/barrel during the six months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Water Disposal Service Fee Revenues. During July 2023, we entered into a transaction in which a portion of the total consideration received was allocated to revenue due to the termination of a minimum volume water disposal contract. Excluding this item, revenue decreased due primarily to lower fees for produced water processed during the period due to rate changes for certain existing contracts, the expiration of certain higher fee per barrel contracts which were replaced with lower fee per barrel contracts with an extended term and higher volumes received under contracts with lower fees per barrel. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in produced water volumes processed from contracted customers and higher fees charged for interruptible spot volumes. 
 
 Recovered Crude Oil Revenues. The increase was due primarily to an increase in skim oil barrels sold from increased produced water processed and higher realized crude oil prices received from the sale of skim oil barrels, partially offset by 
 47

certain producers recycling their water for use in their operations. Also, during the six months ended September 30, 2023 , we sold approximately 34,380 barrels of skim oil that were stored as of March 31, 2023 due to tighter pipeline specifications. 
 
 Recycled Water Revenues. The decrease was due primarily to lower pricing for recycled water, partially offset by an increase in recycled water volumes related to timing of water to be used in completions. 
 
 Other Revenues. The decrease was due primarily to lower land surface use revenues, mining revenues and lease revenue from certain surface use and compensation agreements primarily due to the sale of our ranches in April 2024 (see Note 15 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report). We also had lower reimbursements from construction projects. These decreases were partially offset by higher reimbursements from booster operating fees and generator rentals. 
 
 Cost of Sales-Excluding Impact of Derivatives . The decrease was due primarily to lower recycling costs and lower third-party disposal fees, partially offset by costs incurred that will be reimbursed by producers for generator and fuel costs at various booster stations. 
 
 Derivative (Gain) Loss . During the six months ended September 30, 2024, we had 0.5 million of net unrealized gains on derivatives and 2.7 million of net realized gains on derivatives. During the six months ended September 30, 2023, we had 4.5 million of net unrealized losses on derivatives and less than 0.1 million of net realized losses on derivatives. 
 
 Operating and General and Administrative Expenses . The decrease was due primarily to lower chemical expense due to purchasing fewer chemicals and using chemicals more efficiently and lower repairs and maintenance expense due to the timing of repairs and tank cleaning. These decreases were partially offset by higher utilities expense due to increased produced water volumes processed, higher business insurance expense for remediation costs incurred and lower severance taxes in the prior year quarter as a result of a severance tax refund in September 2023 related to prior periods. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense . The decrease was due primarily to certain long-term assets being fully amortized, impaired or sold during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 and six months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by depreciation of newly developed facilities and infrastructure. 
 
 (Gain) Loss on Disposal or Impairment of Assets, Net . During the six months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a net gain of 10.5 million primarily related to the sale of certain assets (see Note 15 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report) and a gain of 1.8 million from insurance recoveries for certain saltwater disposal facilities and boosters damaged in a prior period. In addition, we recorded a net loss of 3.6 million primarily related to the write down of the value of certain saltwater disposal wells as well as abandonment of certain capital projects and the retirement of certain other assets. During the six months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a net loss of 16.2 million primarily related to the sale of certain assets and a net loss of 6.1 million related to the abandonment of certain capital projects and the retirement of certain assets.

 (1) Revenues include 0.2 million and 0.3 million of intersegment sales during the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, that are eliminated in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 (2) Information is presented as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 (3) Cost and product margin per barrel excludes the impact of derivatives. 
 
 Crude Oil Sales and Cost of Sales-Excluding Impact of Derivatives. The decreases in sales and cost of sales, excluding the impact of derivatives, were due primarily to lower sales volumes due to lower production on acreage dedicated to us in the DJ Basin during the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was partially offset by higher crude oil prices and price differentials. 
 
 During the six months ended September 30, 2024, product margin decreased primarily due to the lower contracted volumes shipped on the Grand Mesa Pipeline, which is discussed above. During the six months ended September 30, 2024, margin per barrel decreased as higher priced inventory was sold into a market of declining prices. In the prior year period, while we experienced a decline in margin due to declining prices during the three months ended June 30, 2023, the market experienced a steeper increase in prices during the three months ended September 30, 2023, which resulted in improved margins for the prior period. The decrease in margin per barrel year over year is partially offset by higher price and quality differentials realized in the current period compared to the prior period. Crude oil product margin calculations do not include gains and losses from derivatives that may offset the movement in the physical margin. 
 
 Derivative (Gain) Loss. Our cost of sales during the six months ended September 30, 2024 included 0.8 million of net realized losses on derivatives and 6.0 million of net unrealized gains on derivatives. Our cost of sales during the six months ended September 30, 2023 included 1.5 million of net realized gains on derivatives and 9.7 million of net unrealized losses on derivatives. The amounts for the six months ended September 30, 2023 included net realized gains of 0.7 million and net unrealized gains of 0.4 million associated with derivative instruments related to our hedge of the CMA Differential Roll, defined and discussed below under Non-GAAP Financial Measures. The CMA hedge expired as of December 31, 2023 and we did not enter into another hedge.

Table of Contents 

Crude Oil Transportation and Other Sales. The increase was primarily due to higher tariff revenue on the Grand Mesa Pipeline as a result of signing a new shipper during the open season that ended on January 5, 2024. Additionally, the six months ended September 30, 2024 also benefited from higher terminaling revenue from an acreage dedication in the Eagle Ford Basin as compared to the prior period. These increases were partially offset by lower throughput fees due to lower volumes, and lower storage fees at our Cushing terminal during the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior period. 
 
 During the six months ended September 30, 2024, physical volumes on the Grand Mesa Pipeline averaged approximately 63,000 barrels per day, compared to approximately 71,000 barrels per day during the six months ended September 30, 2023. Lower contracted volumes were shipped on the Grand Mesa Pipeline due to lower production on acreage dedicated to us in the DJ Basin. 
 
 Operating and General and Administrative Expenses . The decrease was primarily due to lower utilities expense and lower materials and supplies expense on the Grand Mesa Pipeline and at our Cushing terminal due to lower volumes flowing through the system during the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, the six months ended September 30, 2024 benefited from lower cleaning, repairs and maintenance costs on our owned railcars, lower environmental costs at one of our terminals, and lower corporate cost allocations. These decreases were partially offset by higher ad valorem taxes on our Grand Mesa Pipeline assets due to a higher assessed value by the State of Colorado, which we are currently protesting, and higher compensation expense. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense. The decrease was primarily due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated during the year ended March 31, 2024. 
 
 (Gain) Loss on Disposal or Impairment of Assets, Net . During the six months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a net gain of 0.4 million primarily due to a gain on the sale of certain assets. During the six months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a net loss of 0.4 million primarily due to disposals and retirements of certain assets including linefill and certain real estate assets.

 Refined Products Sales and Cost of Sales-Excluding Impact of Derivatives. The decreases in sales and cost of sales, excluding the impact of derivatives, during the six months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to a decrease in commodity prices and a decrease in volumes due to demand. 
 
 Refined Products product margins, excluding the impact of derivatives, decreased during the six months ended September 30, 2024. This decrease was due primarily to higher margins during the three months ended June 30, 2023 due to higher demand in several markets experiencing tighter supply. 
 
 Refined Products Derivative (Gain) Loss. Our Refined Products product margin during the six months ended September 30, 2024 included realized gains of 0.1 million and the six months ended September 30, 2023 included realized losses of 0.2 million. 
 
 Propane Sales and Cost of Sales-Excluding Impact of Derivatives. The decreases in sales and cost of sales, excluding the impact of derivatives, were due primarily to decreased volumes during the six months ended September 30, 2024. Propane volumes decreased during the six months ended September 30, 2024 due to lower contracted volumes and reduced retail customer demand. 
 
 Propane product margins, excluding the impact of derivatives, decreased as we sold higher priced inventory into a market of declining prices during the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to selling lower priced inventory into a market with rising prices during the six months ended September 30, 2023. Also contributing to the decrease is the continued consolidation in the retail propane industry. Also, we incurred higher than anticipated costs to clean and repair railcars coming off lease during the six months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Propane Derivative (Gain) Loss. Our cost of propane sales included 6.3 million of net unrealized losses on derivatives and 8.1 million of net realized gains on derivatives during the six months ended September 30, 2024. During the 
 52 

Table of Contents 

six months ended September 30, 2023, our cost of propane sales included 3.2 million of net unrealized gains on derivatives and 3.9 million of net realized losses on derivatives. 
 
 Butane Sales and Cost of Sales-Excluding Impact of Derivatives. The increases in sales and cost of sales, excluding the impact of derivatives, during the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023, were due to higher butane prices, higher demand during the end of the gasoline blending season in April 2024 and a stronger start to the gasoline blending season in August through September 2024. Also, export markets were stronger during the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Butane product margins, excluding the impact of derivatives, increased during the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023, due to increased prices and volumes, as discussed further above. 
 
 Butane Derivative Loss (Gain). Our cost of butane sales during the six months ended September 30, 2024 included 7.7 million of net unrealized losses on derivatives and 0.1 million of net realized gains on derivatives. Our cost of butane sales included 2.3 million of net unrealized gains on derivatives and 2.7 million of net realized gains on derivatives during the six months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Other Products Sales and Cost of Sales-Excluding Impact of Derivatives. The increases in sales and cost of sales, excluding the impact of derivatives, were primarily due to higher volumes, partially offset by lower commodity prices for biodiesel and RINs during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Other products sales product margins, excluding the impact of derivatives, during the six months ended September 30, 2024 increased due to the increase in biodiesel and asphalt volumes and higher commodity prices for other natural gas liquids. 
 
 Other Products Derivatives Loss (Gain). Our derivatives of other products during the six months ended September 30, 2024 included 16.0 million of net unrealized losses on derivatives and 9.2 million of net realized gains on derivatives. Our derivatives of other products during the six months ended September 30, 2023 included no unrealized gains/losses on derivatives and 8.3 million of net realized gains on derivatives. 
 
 Service Sales and Cost of Sales. The sales includes storage, terminaling and transportation services income. Revenues and cost of sales during the six months ended September 30, 2024 were consistent with the six months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Operating and General and Administrative Expenses . The decrease during the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023 was due to a decrease in travel and entertainment expenses due to a push in the prior year to visit all customers, lower office lease expense due to the sale of certain terminals in the prior year, and a lower allocation of overhead costs. The decrease was offset by an increase to the provision for expected credit losses and sales commissions. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense . The decrease during the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023 was due to a customer relationship intangible asset being fully amortized as of June 30, 2023. 
 
 Gain on Disposal or Impairment of Assets, Net. During the six months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a net gain of 6.9 million due to the sale of two terminals in July 2023 and recorded a net gain of 0.8 million due to disposal of certain other assets.

Corporate and Other 
 
 The operating loss within Corporate and Other includes the following components for the periods indicated: 
 Six Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change (in thousands) Other Revenues Service revenues 74 74 Cost of sales Derivative loss 833 (833) Expenses: General and administrative expenses 19,470 29,646 (10,176) Depreciation and amortization expense 1,357 3,113 (1,756) Total expenses 20,827 32,759 (11,932) Operating loss (20,753) (33,592) 12,839 
 
 Service Revenues. These revenues relate to payments made by the noncontrolling interest holder for usage of the airplane acquired in June 2024. 
 
 Cost of Sales - Derivative Loss. Our cost of sales during the six months ended September 30, 2023 included 0.4 million of net realized losses on derivatives and 0.4 million of net unrealized losses on derivatives. We entered into economic hedges to protect our liquidity positions and leverage from a significant increase in commodity prices that drive our working capital demands. There were no open hedge positions that would impact cost of sales as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 General and Administrative Expenses. The expenses during the six months ended September 30, 2024 were lower than the six months ended September 30, 2023 due to lower legal expenses as several large cases ended and from the reimbursement of legal expenses relating to a dispute associated with commercial activities in prior periods, lower compensation expense due to incentive compensation and due to the elimination of share-based compensation expense due to all outstanding long-term incentive plan awards being fully vested in November 2023. Business insurance expense was also lower in the current period, as we paid the insurance company to be released from any future supplementary calls on our indemnity policy related to our former crude marine business (which we sold on March 30, 2023) during the prior year periods, as well as accruing for higher claims in the prior year. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense . The decrease during the six months ended September 30, 2024 was due to software that became fully depreciated during the year ended March 31, 2024. 

Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Entities 
 
 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities was 1.8 million during the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.9 million during the six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 0.9 million during the six months ended September 30, 2024 was due primarily to higher earnings from certain membership interests related to specific land and water services operations and a lower loss from our interest in an aircraft company which was dissolved on April 30, 2024.

Interest Expense 
 
 The following table summarizes the components of our consolidated interest expense for the periods indicated: 
 Six Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change (in thousands) Senior secured notes 91,000 76,875 14,125 Term Loan B 34,052 34,052 ABL Facility 9,545 9,805 (260) Senior unsecured notes 21,260 (21,260) Other indebtedness 1,128 1,969 (841) Total debt interest expense 135,725 109,909 25,816 Amortization of debt issuance costs 5,775 8,240 (2,465) Unrealized loss on interest rate swaps 7,473 7,473 Realized gain on interest rate swaps (1,830) (1,830) Total interest expense 147,143 118,149 28,994 
 
 The debt interest expense increased 25.8 million during the six months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to higher interest rates on Term Loan B, the 2029 Senior Secured Notes, and the 2032 Senior Secured Notes. 

Gain on Early Extinguishment of Liabilities, Net 
 
 Gain on early extinguishment of liabilities, net of 6.9 million during the six months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of a net gain (inclusive of debt issuance costs written off) primarily related to the early extinguishment of a portion of the outstanding senior unsecured notes. We did not repurchase any debt during the six months ended September 30, 2024. 

Other Income, Net 
 
 Other income, net of 2.0 million during the six months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of an unrealized gain on an investment and interest income on loan receivables. Other income, net of 0.6 million during the six months ended September 30, 2023 consisted primarily of interest income on loan receivables (see Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for a further discussion). 

Income Tax Benefit (Expense) 
 
 Income tax benefit was 4.5 million during the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to income tax expense of 0.5 million during the six months ended September 30, 2023. See Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for a further discussion. 

Noncontrolling Interests - Redeemable and Nonredeemable 
 
 Noncontrolling interest income was 1.7 million during the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.5 million during the six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 1.2 million during the six months ended September 30, 2024 was due primarily to higher income from certain water solutions operations. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 In addition to financial results reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP ), we have provided the non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be a substitute for those reported in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other entities, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures. 
 
 We define EBITDA as net income (loss) attributable to NGL Energy Partners LP, plus interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), and depreciation and amortization expense. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA excluding net unrealized gains and losses on derivatives, lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments, gains and losses on disposal or impairment of assets, gains and losses on early extinguishment of liabilities, equity-based compensation expense, revaluation of 
 55 

Table of Contents 

liabilities and other. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to net income, income before income taxes, cash flows from operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, as those items are used to measure operating performance, liquidity or the ability to service debt obligations. We believe that EBITDA provides additional information to investors for evaluating our ability to make quarterly distributions to our unitholders and is presented solely as a supplemental measure. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides additional information to investors for evaluating our financial performance without regard to our financing methods, capital structure and historical cost basis. Further, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as we define them, may not be comparable to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, or similarly titled measures used by other entities. 
 
 For purposes of our Adjusted EBITDA calculation, we make a distinction between realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives. During the period when a derivative contract is open, we record changes in the fair value of the derivative as an unrealized gain or loss. When a derivative contract matures or is settled, we reverse the previously recorded unrealized gain or loss and record a realized gain or loss. In our Crude Oil Logistics segment, we purchase certain crude oil barrels using the West Texas Intermediate WTI calendar month average CMA price and sell the crude oil barrels using the WTI CMA price plus the Argus CMA Differential Roll Component CMA Differential Roll per our contracts. To eliminate the volatility of the CMA Differential Roll, we entered into derivative instrument positions in January 2021 to secure a margin of approximately 0.20 per barrel on 1.5 million barrels per month from May 2021 through December 2023. Due to the nature of these positions, the cash flow and earnings recognized on a GAAP basis differed from period to period depending on the current crude oil price and future estimated crude oil price which were valued utilizing third-party market quoted prices. We recognized in Adjusted EBITDA the gains and losses from the derivative instrument positions entered into in January 2021 to properly align with the physical margin we hedged each month through the term of this transaction. This representation aligns with management s evaluation of the transaction. The derivative instrument positions we entered into related to the CMA Differential Roll expired as of December 31, 2023, and we have not entered into any new derivative instrument positions related to the CMA Differential Roll. 
 
 As previously reported, for purposes of our Adjusted EBITDA calculation, we did not draw a distinction between realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives of certain businesses within our Liquids Logistics segment. The primary hedging strategy of these businesses is to hedge against the risk of declines in the value of inventory over the course of the contract cycle, and many of the hedges cover extended periods of time. The inventory valuation adjustment row in the reconciliation table reflects the difference between the market value of the inventory of these businesses at the balance sheet date and its cost. We include this in Adjusted EBITDA because the unrealized gains and losses for derivative contracts associated with the inventory of this segment, which are intended primarily to hedge inventory holding risk and are included in net income, also affect Adjusted EBITDA. Beginning April 1, 2024, and going forward, we will now be drawing a distinction between realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives and will no longer include the activity on the inventory valuation adjustment row in the reconciliation table for these certain businesses within our Liquids Logistics segment. This change aligns with how management now views and evaluates the transactions within these businesses and is also consistent with the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA used in our other businesses. If this change was made as of April 1, 2023, Adjusted EBITDA for the three months and six months ended September 30, 2023 would have been 175.8 million and 311.8 million, respectively.

Liquidity, Sources of Capital and Capital Resource Activities 
 
 General 
 
 Our principal sources of liquidity and capital resource requirements are cash flows from our operations, borrowings under the 600.0 million asset-based revolving credit facility ABL Facility ), issuing long-term notes, common and/or preferred units, loans from financial institutions, asset securitizations or asset sales. We expect our primary cash outflows to be related to capital expenditures, interest, repayment of debt maturities and distributions. 
 
 We believe that our anticipated cash flows from operations and the borrowing capacity under the ABL Facility will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs. Our borrowing needs vary during the year due in part to the seasonal nature of certain businesses within our Liquids Logistics segment. Our greatest working capital borrowing needs generally occur during the period of June through December, when we are building our natural gas liquids inventories in anticipation of the butane blending and propane heating seasons. Our working capital borrowing needs generally decline during the period of January through March, when the cash inflows from our Liquids Logistics segment are the greatest. In addition, our working capital borrowing needs vary with changes in commodity prices. A significant increase in commodity prices could drive up our working capital demands and limit our ability to continue to delever our balance sheet and restrict our financial flexibility. To protect our liquidity and leverage, we have in the past and may in the future enter into economic hedges that mitigate this exposure when we are building inventory. There were no open hedge positions as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Cash Management 
 
 We manage cash by utilizing a centralized cash management program that concentrates the cash assets of our operating subsidiaries in joint accounts for the purposes of providing financial flexibility and lowering the cost of borrowing, transaction costs and bank fees. Our centralized cash management program provides that funds in excess of the daily needs of our operating subsidiaries are concentrated, consolidated or otherwise made available for use within our consolidated group. All of our wholly-owned operating subsidiaries participate in this program. Under the cash management program, depending on whether a participating subsidiary has short-term cash surpluses or cash requirements, we provide cash to the subsidiary or the subsidiary provides cash to us. 
 
 Short-Term Liquidity 
 
 Our principal sources of short-term liquidity consist of cash flows from our operations and borrowings under the ABL Facility, which we believe will provide liquidity to operate our business, manage our working capital requirements and repay current maturities. 
 
 Commitments under the ABL Facility are 600.0 million, subject to a borrowing base, and includes a sub-limit for letters of credit of 200.0 million. At September 30, 2024, 274.0 million had been borrowed under the ABL Facility and we had letters of credit outstanding of 79.4 million. The ABL Facility is scheduled to mature at the earliest of (a) February 2, 2029 or (b) 91 days prior to the earliest maturity date in respect to any of our indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount of 50.0 million or greater, subject to certain exceptions. 
 
 For additional information related to the ABL Facility, see Note 6 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our current assets exceeded our current liabilities by approximately 174.5 million. 

Long-Term Financing 
 
 We expect to fund our long-term financing requirements by issuing long-term notes, common units and/or preferred units, loans from financial institutions, asset securitizations or asset sales. 
 
 Senior Secured Notes 
 
 On February 2, 2024, we closed on our private offering of 900.0 million of the 2029 Senior Secured Notes and 1.3 billion of the 2032 Senior Secured Notes. Interest on the 2029 Senior Secured Notes and 2032 Senior Secured Notes is payable on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on May 15, 2024.

Term Loan B 
 
 On February 2, 2024, we entered into a new seven-year 700.0 million senior secured Term Loan B. The Term Loan B matures on February 2, 2031 and will amortize in equal quarterly installments in aggregate annual amounts equal to 1.0 of the original principal amount beginning with the quarter ended June 30, 2024, with the balance payable on maturity.

 Capital expenditures for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025 are expected to be approximately 210 million. 

Distributions Declared 
 
 On February 4, 2021, the board of directors of our GP temporarily suspended all distributions, including common unit distributions which began with the quarter ended December 31, 2020 and preferred unit distributions which began with the quarter ended March 31, 2021. 
 
 On April 4, 2024, the board of directors of our GP declared a cash distribution of 55.4 of the outstanding distribution arrearages through the quarter ended March 31, 2024 to the holders of the Class B Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units Class B Preferred Units ), the Class C Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units Class C Preferred Units and the 9.00 Class D Preferred Units Class D Preferred Units ). The total distribution of 120.0 million was made on April 18, 2024 to the holders of record at the close of trading on April 12, 2024. 
 
 On April 9, 2024, the board of directors of our GP declared a cash distribution to fully pay the remaining distribution arrearages and interest through the quarter ended March 31, 2024 to the holders of the Class B Preferred Units, the Class C Preferred Units and the Class D Preferred Units. The total distribution of 98.1 million, which included a distribution of 27.3 million earned during the quarter ended March 31, 2024, was made on April 25, 2024 to the holders of record at the close of trading on April 19, 2024. 
 
 As of April 25, 2024, all preferred unit distributions in arrears have been paid. 
 
 On June 21, 2024, the board of directors of our GP declared a cash distribution for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 to the holders of the Class B Preferred Units, the Class C Preferred Units and the Class D Preferred Units. The total distribution of 28.8 million was made on July 15, 2024 to the holders of record at the close of trading on July 1, 2024.

 Operating Activities. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities during the six months ended September 30, 2024 was due primarily to fluctuations in working capital, particularly accounts receivable and accounts payable, due to lower crude oil volumes and lower crude oil prices, lower purchases and sales of natural gas liquids due to seasonal demand and the timing of invoices and payments on construction projects as well as fluctuations in inventory due to building our natural gas liquids inventories in anticipation of the butane blending and propane heating seasons, and lower earnings from operations. 
 
 On June 13, 2024, we paid LCT Capital, LLC LCT 63.3 million related to the legal judgment against us, of which 27.2 million represented interest and 0.1 million of costs awarded to LCT.

Environmental Legislation 
 
 See our Annual Report for a discussion of proposed environmental legislation and regulations that, if enacted, could result in increased compliance and operating costs. However, at this time we cannot predict the structure or outcome of any future legislation or regulations or the eventual cost we could incur in compliance. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements that are applicable to us, see Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires the selection and application of appropriate accounting principles to the relevant facts and circumstances of our operations and the use of estimates made by management. We have identified certain more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that are most important to the portrayal of our consolidated financial position and results of operations. The application of these accounting policies, which requires subjective or complex judgments regarding estimates and projected outcomes of future events, and changes in these accounting policies, could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes in the critical accounting estimates previously disclosed in our Annual Report. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 A portion of our long-term debt is variable-rate debt. Changes in interest rates impact the interest payments of our variable-rate debt but generally do not impact the fair value of the liability. Conversely, changes in interest rates impact the fair value of our fixed-rate debt but do not impact its cash flows. 
 
 The ABL Facility is variable-rate debt with interest rates that are generally indexed to the prime rate or a secured overnight financing rate SOFR ). At September 30, 2024, we had 274.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the ABL Facility at a weighted average interest rate of 7.83 . A change in interest rates of 0.125 would result in an increase or decrease of our annual interest expense of 0.3 million, based on borrowings outstanding at September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Term Loan B is variable-rate debt with interest rates that are generally indexed to SOFR. At September 30, 2024, there was 696.5 million of outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan B with an interest rate of SOFR rate of 4.85 plus a margin of 3.75 . A change in interest rates of 0.125 would result in an increase or decrease of our annual interest expense of 0.9 million, based on borrowings outstanding at September 30, 2024. 
 
 In March and April 2024, we entered into interest rate swaps totaling 400.0 million to reduce the variability of cash outflows associated with our floating-rate, SOFR-based borrowings, including borrowings on the Term Loan B. In September 2024, for the 200.0 million interest rate swap entered into in April 2024, we entered into a transaction to extend the original maturity date and to blend the existing swap rate (see Note 9 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for a further discussion). An increase of 10 in the value of the underlying interest rate swaps would result in a net change in the fair value of our interest rate swaps of 0.7 million at September 30, 2024. 
 
 The current distribution rate for the Class B Preferred Units is a floating rate of the three-month CME Term SOFR plus a tenor spread adjustment plus a spread of 7.213 (see Note 8 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for a further discussion). A change in interest rates of 0.125 would result in an increase or decrease of our Class B Preferred Unit distribution of 0.1 million, based on the Class B Preferred Units outstanding at September 30, 2024. 
 
 The current distribution rate for the Class C Preferred Units is a floating rate of the three-month CME Term SOFR plus a spread of 7.384 (see Note 8 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for a further discussion). A change in interest rates of 0.125 would result in an increase or decrease of our Class C Preferred Unit distribution of less than 0.1 million, based on the Class C Preferred Units outstanding at September 30, 2024. 
 
 The current distribution rate for the Class D Preferred Units is a floating rate of the three-month CME Term SOFR plus a spread of 7.00 (see Note 8 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly 
 63 

Table of Contents 

Report for a further discussion). A change in interest rates of 0.125 would result in an increase or decrease of our Class D Preferred Unit distribution of 0.2 million, based on the Class D Preferred Units outstanding at September 30, 2024. 

Commodity Price Risk 
 
 Our operations are subject to certain business risks, including commodity price risk. Commodity price risk is the risk that the market value of crude oil, natural gas liquids, or refined and renewables products will change, either favorably or unfavorably, in response to changing market conditions. Procedures and limits for managing commodity price risks are specified in our market risk policy. Open commodity positions and market price changes are monitored daily and are reported to senior management and to marketing operations personnel. 
 
 The crude oil, natural gas liquids, and refined and renewables products industries are margin-based and cost-plus businesses in which our realized margins depend on the differential of sales prices over our supply costs. We have no control over market conditions. As a result, our profitability may be impacted by sudden and significant changes in the price of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and refined and renewables products. 
 
 We engage in various types of forward contracts and financial derivative transactions to reduce the effect of price volatility on our product costs, to protect the value of our inventory positions, and to help ensure the availability of product during periods of short supply. We attempt to balance our contractual portfolio by purchasing volumes when we have a matching purchase commitment from our wholesale and retail customers. We may experience net unbalanced positions from time to time. In addition to our ongoing policy to maintain a balanced position, for accounting purposes we are required, on an ongoing basis, to track and report the market value of our derivative portfolio. 
 
 Although we use financial derivative instruments to reduce the market price risk associated with forecasted transactions, we do not account for financial derivative transactions as hedges. All changes in the fair value of our physical contracts that do not qualify as normal purchases and normal sales and settlements (whether cash transactions or non-cash mark-to-market adjustments) are reported either within revenue (for sales contracts) or cost of sales (for purchase contracts) in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations, regardless of whether the contract is physically or financially settled, and within cash flows from operations in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. 
 
 The following table summarizes the hypothetical impact on the September 30, 2024 fair value of our commodity derivatives of an increase of 10 in the value of the underlying commodity (in thousands): 
 Increase (Decrease) To Fair Value Crude oil (Water Solutions segment) 9 Crude oil (Crude Oil Logistics segment) (1,135) Propane (Liquids Logistics segment) 948 Butane (Liquids Logistics segment) (7,435) Refined Products (Liquids Logistics segment) (1,684) Other Products (Liquids Logistics segment) (2,125) 
 
 Changes in commodity prices may also impact the volumes that we are able to transport, dispose, store and market, which also impact our cash flows. 

Credit Risk 
 
 Our operations are also subject to credit risk, which is the risk of loss from nonperformance by suppliers, customers or financial counterparties to a contract. Procedures and limits for managing credit risk are specified in our credit policy. Credit risk is monitored daily and we believe we minimize exposure through the following: 
 
 requiring certain customers to prepay or place deposits for our products and services; 
 requiring certain customers to post letters of credit or other forms of surety; 
 monitoring individual customer receivables relative to previously-approved credit limits; 
 requiring certain customers to take delivery of their contracted volume ratably rather than allow them to take delivery at their discretion; 
 64 

Table of Contents 

entering into master netting agreements that allow for offsetting counterparty receivable and payable balances for certain transactions; 
 reviewing the receivable aging regularly to identify issues or trends that may develop; and 
 requiring marketing personnel to manage their customers receivable position and suspend sales to customers that have not timely paid outstanding invoices. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, our primary counterparties were retailers, resellers, energy marketers, producers, refiners, and dealers. 

Fair Value 
 
 We determine the fair value of our exchange traded derivative financial instruments utilizing publicly available prices, and for non-exchange traded derivative financial instruments, we utilize pricing models for similar instruments including publicly available prices and forward curves generated from a compilation of data gathered from third-parties. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13(a)-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure the information required to be disclosed in our filings and submissions under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of our GP, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 We completed an evaluation under the supervision and with participation of our management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of our GP, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures at September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of our GP have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, such disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 
 There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13(a)-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
