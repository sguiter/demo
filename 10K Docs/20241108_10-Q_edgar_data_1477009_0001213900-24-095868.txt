back to the December 31, 2023 balance and recording an uncertain tax benefit (UTB) liability to reflect the expected tax liability should
the Internal Revenue Service reject the uncertain tax position taken by the company regarding 280E, net of the valuation allowance.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

This Management s Discussion and Analysis MD A is intended to provide an understanding of our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by
focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Condensed
Consolidated Unaudited Financial Statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the Consolidated Financial Statements
and related notes and MD A appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023.
The results of operations for an interim period may not give a true indication of results for future interim periods or for the year. 

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking
Statements 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including
the financial statements and related notes, contains forward-looking statements that discuss, among other things, future expectations
and projections regarding future developments, operations and financial conditions. All forward-looking statements are based on management s
existing beliefs about present and future events outside of management s control and on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect.
If any underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated, projected or
intended. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in
expectations or events or circumstances after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

When this report uses the words we, 
 us, or our, and the Company, they refer to TREES Corporation (formerly, General Cannabis
Corp ). 

Our Products, Services, and Customers

cultivator in the States of Colorado and Oregon. 

We presently operate five (5) cannabis dispensaries
as follows: 

Englewood, Colorado 

o 
 5005 S. Federal Boulevard Recreational license only 

Denver, Colorado 

o 
 East Hampden Avenue (formerly Green Man) Recreational license
 only 

Longmont, Colorado 

o 
 12626 N. 107 th Street (formerly Green Tree/Ancient Alternatives)
 Medical and Recreational licenses 

Two (2) in Oregon 

o 
 SW Corbett Avenue, Portland, OR Medical and Recreational
 licenses 

o 
 NE 102 nd Avenue, Portland, OR Medical and Recreational
 licenses 

We also operate two (2) cultivation facilities
in Colorado as follows: 

SevenFive Farm 3705 N. 75 th Street, Boulder 
 Retail cultivation license only 

6859 N. Foothills Highway E-100 (formerly Green Tree/Hillside Enterprises)
 Retail cultivation license only 

16 

Our principal business model is to acquire, integrate
and optimize cannabis companies in the retail and cultivation segments utilizing the combined experience of entrepreneurs and synergistic
operations of our vertically integrated network. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, SevenFive had zero dollars in revenue
and during the three months ended September 30, 2023, 89 of SevenFive s revenue was with five customers, respectively. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 100 of SevenFive s revenue was with three customers and 50 of SevenFive s
revenue was with one customer, respectively. The customers in 2024 are related party dispensaries and the revenues associated with these
customers are eliminated in consolidation. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, 92 of Hillside Cultivation s (formerly noted as Green Tree) revenue was with three customers, and 84 of Hillside Cultivation s
(formerly noted as Green Tree) revenue was with four customers, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
98 of Hillside Cultivation s (formerly noted as Green Tree) revenue was with three customers, and 78 of Hillside Cultivation s
(formerly noted as Green Tree) revenue was with three customers, respectively. The customers in 2024 are related party dispensaries and
the revenues associated with these customers are eliminated in consolidation. 

Hillsides Cultivation s revenue includes
revenue from an external wholesale vendor totaling 5,084 which has been applied to open accounts payable for the retail segment of the
Company for the same vendor. Accounts payable and the associated cost of goods sold expense have been increased for the retail segment
to account for this adjustment.

Revenues 

The reversal of the acquisition of a portion of the Green Tree assets,
which were returned in Q3 2023, contributed to the decrease in revenues and expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared
to September 30, 2023, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Cost of sales decreased for three and nine months
ended September 30, 2024, as compared to September 30, 2023 due to the reversal of the acquisition of a portion of the Green Tree assets. 

Selling, general and administrative expense decreased
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to September 30, 2023 due to the decreased expenses resulting from
the reversal of the acquisition of one dispensary and one cultivation facility in the third quarter of 2023 and one additional dispensary
license in the first quarter of 2023, resulting in a decrease in employees and rent expense.

Employee awards are issued under our 2020 Omnibus
Incentive Plan, which was approved by shareholders on November 23, 2020. Expense varies primarily due to the number of stock options
and restricted stock awards granted and the share price on the date of grant. The decrease in expense for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2024, as compared to September 30, 2023, is due to issuing less restricted stock awards at a higher per unit grant date
value in the second quarter of 2024. 

Professional fees consist primarily of accounting
and legal expenses. Professional fees increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to increased accounting and legal
fees related to our 2023 tax return and the related tax position therein (See Note 6 Income Tax Payable for details). Professional fees
decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to September 30, 2023 due to the lack of unusual accounting activity
in the first and second quarters of 2024 as compared to the 2023 periods. 

Depreciation and amortization decreased due to
the reversal of the acquisition of a portion of the Green Tree assets and a revaluation of the Green Tree and Green Man acquisitions
as of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to September 30, 2023.

Amortization of debt discount decreased during
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to September 30, 2023 due to the change in outstanding debt related to
the Green Tree acquisition reversal. Interest expense increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared
to September 30, 2023, due to the resumption of interest in Q3 2023 of the 12 Notes. The gain on warrant derivative liability reflects
the change in the fair value of the 2019 Warrants which expired in Q2 2024. The loss on contingent earnout reflects the change in the
fair value of the Green Tree Contingent Earnout liability which expired in Q2 2024.

The decrease in revenues for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023, is due to the closure of three cultivations during Q2 2023 and a reduction
in grow operations at one of the remaining cultivations facilities in Q1 2023. The decrease in cost and expenses for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023 is attributed to the closure of three cultivations during Q2 2023 and
a reduction in grow operations at one of the remaining cultivations facilities in Q1 2023. The costs and expense incurred between
our dispensaries and cultivation locations are eliminated in consolidation. 

Liquidity 

Sources of liquidity 

Our sources of liquidity historically have included
the cash exercise of common stock options and warrants, debt, and the issuance of common stock or other equity-based instruments. We
anticipate our significant uses of resources will include funding operations. 

Sources and uses of cash 

We had cash of 245,367 and 969,676 as of September
30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities were as follows: 

Nine months ended September 30, 

2024 
 2023 
 
 Net cash used in operating activities 
 (481,939 
 (1,147,432

 (45,631 
 (265,858 
 
 Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities 
 (196,739 
 (918,852 

Net cash used in operating activities increased
in 2024 due to the expiration and subsequent gain of the Green Tree contingent earnout and gain on extinguishment of debt due to the
Centri promissory note. 

Net cash used in investing activities for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 from September 30, 2023 decreased as a result of a lack of acquisition activity in 2024. 

Net cash used in financing activities for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased from September 30, 2023 due to the partial reversal of the acquisition of a portion of
the Green Tree assets and the issuance of the 2024 Working Capital Note. 

Capital Resources 

We had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of September
30, 2024. Part of our growth strategy, however, is to acquire operating businesses. We expect to fund such activity through cash
on hand, the issuance of debt, common stock, warrants for our common stock or a combination thereof.

Critical Accounting Policies 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the amounts of revenues
and expenses. Critical accounting policies are those that require the application of management s most difficult, subjective, or
complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may
change in subsequent periods. In applying these critical accounting policies, our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate
assumptions to be used in making certain estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 

We define critical accounting policies as those
that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and which may potentially result in materially different results under
different assumptions and conditions. In applying these critical accounting policies, our management uses its judgment to determine the
appropriate assumptions to be used in making certain estimates. These estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. 

Business Combinations 

Amounts paid for acquisitions are allocated to
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. The fair value of identifiable
intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management, including expected future
cash flows. We allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net assets and liabilities acquired to goodwill. Identifiable
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives. Acquisition-related costs, including advisory, legal, accounting,
valuation, and other costs, are expensed in the periods in which the costs are incurred. The results of operations of acquired businesses
are included in the consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date. 

Goodwill and Intangibles 

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price
over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill and long-lived intangible assets are tested
for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of ASC No. 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other ASC
No. 350 ). ASC No. 350 requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level
below an operating segment) on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely
than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carry value. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment,
including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting
units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. We test goodwill annually in December, unless an event occurs that
would cause us to believe the value is impaired at an interim date. See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2023, for discussion of the Company s significant accounting policies. 

Intangible assets with finite useful lives are
amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. 

Impairment of Long-lived Assets 

We periodically evaluate whether the carrying
value of property and equipment has been impaired when circumstances indicate the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable.
The carrying amount is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual
disposition of the asset. If the carrying value is not recoverable, the impairment loss is measured as the excess of the asset s
carrying value over its fair value. 

Our impairment analyses require management to
apply judgment in estimating future cash flows as well as asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets, assessing
the probability of different outcomes, and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows. If the carrying
value is not recoverable, we assess the fair value of long-lived assets using commonly accepted techniques, and may use more than one
method, including, but not limited to, recent third-party comparable sales and undiscounted cash flow models. If actual results are not
consistent with our assumptions and estimates, or our assumptions and estimates change due to new information, we may be exposed to an
impairment charge in the future. 

21 

Debt with Equity-linked Features 

We may issue debt that has separate warrants, conversion features,
or other equity-linked attributes. 

Debt with warrants When we issue
debt with warrants, we treat the warrants as a debt discount, record as a contra-liability against the debt, and amortize the balance
over the life of the underlying debt as amortization of debt discount expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The offset
to the contra-liability is recorded as additional paid in capital in our consolidated balance sheets. If the debt is retired early, the
associated debt discount is then recognized immediately as amortization of debt discount expense in the consolidated statement of operations.
The debt is treated as conventional debt. 

We determine the value of the non-complex warrants
using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model Black-Scholes using the stock price on the date of issuance, the risk-free
interest rate associated with the life of the debt, and the volatility of our stock. For warrants with complex terms, we use the binomial
lattice model to estimate their fair value. 

Convertible Debt - When we issue debt
with a conversion feature, we must first assess whether the conversion feature meets the requirements to be treated as a derivative.
If the conversion feature within convertible debt meets the requirements to be treated as a derivative, we estimate the fair value of
the convertible debt derivative using Black-Scholes upon the date of issuance, using the stock price on the date of issuance, the risk-free
interest rate associated with the life of the debt, and the estimated volatility of our stock. 

Modification of Debt - When we change
the terms of existing notes payable, we evaluate the amendments under ASC 470-50, Debt Modification and Extinguishment to determine
whether the change should be treated as a modification or as a debt extinguishment. This evaluation includes analyzing whether there
are significant and consequential changes to the economic substance of the note. If the change is deemed insignificant then the change
is considered a debt modification, whereas if the change is substantial the change is reflected as a debt extinguishment. 

Equity-based Payments 

We estimate the fair value of equity-based instruments
issued to employees or to third parties for services or goods using Black-Scholes or the Binomial Model, which requires us to estimate
the volatility of our stock and forfeiture rate. 

Revenue Recognition 

ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts
with Customers ASC 606 requires that an entity recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services
to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or
services. ASC 606 defines a five-step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, judgment and estimates may be required
within the revenue recognition process including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable
consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. 

The following five steps are applied to achieve
that core principle: 

Step 1: Identify the contract with the customer; 

Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract; 

Step 3: Determine the transaction price; 

Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations
 in the contract; and 

Step 5: Recognize revenue when the company satisfies a performance
 obligation.

and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes those policies and procedures
that: 

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately
 and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; 

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
 to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures of are being made only
 in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and 

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection
 of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of inherent limitations, our internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can
provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal controls
over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2024, which were identified in connection with management s evaluation required
by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, which have materially affected, or are reasonable likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
