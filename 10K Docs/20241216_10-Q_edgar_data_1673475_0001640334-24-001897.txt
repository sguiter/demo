Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.

The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term by adding interest expense determined using the effective interest method to the amortization of right-of-use asset. Amortization of the right-of-use asset is calculated as the difference between the straight-line expense and the interest expense on the lease liability over the lease term. Lease expense is presented as a single line item in the operating expense in the statement of operations. The right-of-use assets are tested for impairment in accordance with ASC 360.

We expect to generate additional losses for the foreseeable future while we establish our business. We will require additional funds for our budgeted expenses over the next 12 months. These funds may be raised through equity financing, debt financing, or other sources, which may result in further dilution in the equity ownership of our shares. There is still no assurance that we will be able to maintain operations at a level sufficient for an investor to obtain a return on his investment in our common stock. Further, we may continue to be unprofitable. We need to raise additional funds in the immediate future in order to proceed with our budgeted expenses. We anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common stock in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuance of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our planned business activities. We presently do not have any arrangements for additional financing for the expansion of our future operations, and no potential lines of credit or sources of financing are currently available for the purpose of proceeding with our plan of operations. If we are not successful in raising sufficient capital to execute our business plan, we will be required to scale down or delay our plan of operation to accommodate our available resources. 34 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations Not required for smaller reporting companies Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. A change in managements estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Management has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued. Our company s management believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on our financial statements. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by our company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of October 31, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of October 31, 2024. Our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective for the following reasons: We did not maintain effective controls to identify and maintain segregation of duties in identifying, authorizing, approving, accounting for, and disclosing significant estimates, related-party transactions, significant unusual transactions, and other non-routine events and transactions. Specifically, we only have one individual, our sole officer and director, who reviews, evaluates, approves, and records transactions and initiates journal entries, approves journal entries, and posts journal entries to the general ledger. There is no independent review of any financial duties performed by this individual. C hanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting During the period covered by this report there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on the Effectiveness of Internal Controls Our management do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting are or will be capable of preventing or detecting all errors or all fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements, due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns may occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk. 36 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
