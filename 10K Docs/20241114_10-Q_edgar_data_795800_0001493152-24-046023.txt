PART
I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Report for Premium Nickel Resources Ltd. (the Company 
or PNRL (as defined herein), contains forward-looking statements that relate to future events or our future financial
performance. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels
of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements
expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. These risks and other factors include those listed under Risk Factors 
 in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 28, 2024 and elsewhere in this Report. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking
statements by terminology such as may, will, should, expects, plans, 
 anticipates, believes, estimates, predicts, potential, continue 
or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. 

Forward-looking
statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements
to be materially different from any future results, performances or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.
We discuss many of these risks in greater detail under the heading Risk Factors of the 2023 Form 10-K. Given these
uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Also, forward-looking statements represent our
management s beliefs and assumptions only as of the date hereof. You should read this Report and the documents that we have filed
as exhibits to this Report completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what
we expect. 

Except
as required by law, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements publicly, or to update the reasons actual results
could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the
future. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. 

Unless
otherwise indicated, all references to , C and dollars in this Report refer to Canadian
dollars, references to US in this Report refer to United States dollars and references to BWP in this
Report refer to Botswanan Pula. On September 30, 2024, the daily exchange rate: (i) for one United States dollar expressed in
Canadian dollars was US 1.00 = C 1.3499 (or C 1.00 = US 0.7408); (ii) for one Botswanan Pula expressed in Canadian dollars was BWP
1.00 = C 0.1019 (or C 1.00 = BWP 9.8135); and (iii) for one Botswanan Pula expressed in United States dollars was BWP 1.00 =
US 0.0764 (or US 1.00 = BWP 13.0890). This quarter or the quarter means the third quarter Q3 of 2024.
 Year-to-date or year-to-date period means the nine months ended September 30 YTD ). 

CAUTIONARY
STATEMENTS TO INVESTORS ON RESERVES AND RESOURCES 

This Report uses the terms mineral resources , indicated
mineral resources and inferred mineral resources as such terms are defined under Canadian National Instrument 43-101
- Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects NI 43-101 ). NI 43-101 is a rule developed by the Canadian Securities Administrators,
which establishes standards for all public disclosure a Canadian issuer makes of scientific and technical information concerning mineral
projects. 

On October 31, 2018, the SEC adopted new mining disclosure rules S-K
1300 that are more closely aligned with current industry and global regulatory practices and standards, including NI 43-101, with
which we comply because we are also a reporting issuer under Canadian securities laws. While S-K 1300 is more closely aligned
with NI 43-101 than the prior mining disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, there are some differences. Accordingly,
there is no assurance any mineral resources that the Company may report as indicated mineral resources and inferred
mineral resources under NI 43-101 will be the same as the reserve or resource estimates prepared under S-K 1300. Investors should
not assume that any part or all of indicated mineral resources or inferred mineral resources will ever be converted into a higher category
of mineral resources or into mineral reserves. Mineralization described using these terms has a greater amount of uncertainty as to their
existence and feasibility than mineralization that has been characterized as reserves. Accordingly, investors are cautioned not to assume
that any indicated mineral resources or inferred mineral resources on the Company s projects are or
will be economically or legally mineable. Further, inferred resources have a greater amount of uncertainty as to their existence
and as to whether they can be mined legally or economically. Therefore, investors are also cautioned not to assume that all or any part
of the inferred resources exist. In accordance with Canadian rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources cannot form
the basis of feasibility or other economic studies, except in limited circumstances where permitted under NI 43-101. 

It should be noted that the Company filed technical reports prepared in
accordance with S-K 1300 as Exhibits 96.1 and 96.2 to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 28, 2024.

Notes
to the Unaudited Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements 

 For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

 (Expressed
in Canadian dollars) 

The
Company s head and registered office is located at One First Canadian Place, 100 King Street West, Suite 3400, Toronto, Ontario,
Canada M5X 1A4. 

The
principal assets of the Company are the Selebi and Selebi North nickel-copper-cobalt Ni-Cu-Co mines in Botswana
and related infrastructure (together, the Selebi Mines ), as well as the nickel, copper, cobalt, platinum-group elements Ni-Cu-Co-PGE Selkirk mine in Botswana, together with associated infrastructure and four surrounding prospecting
licenses (collectively, the Selkirk Mine and together with the Selebi Mines, the Mines ). 

Going
Concern 

The
Company, being in the exploration stage, is subject to risks and challenges similar to companies in a comparable stage of exploration
and development. These risks include the challenges of securing adequate capital for exploration and advancement of the Company s
material projects, operational risks inherent in the mining industry, and global economic and metal price volatility, and there is no
assurance management will be successful in its endeavors. As at September 30, 2024, the Company had no source of operating cash flows,
nor any credit line currently in place. The Company incurred a net loss of for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.
The Company s committed cash obligations and expected level of expenses will vary depending on its operations. 

These
unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the assumption that the Company will continue as
a going concern, meaning it will continue in operation for the foreseeable future and will be able to realize assets and discharge liabilities
in the ordinary course of operations. The ability of the Company to continue operations as a going concern is ultimately dependent upon
achieving profitable operations and its ability to obtain adequate financing. To date, the Company has not generated profitable operations
from its resource activities and will need to invest additional funds in carrying out its planned evaluation, development and operational
activities. It is not possible to predict whether financing efforts will be successful or if the Company will attain a profitable level
of operations. These material uncertainties cast substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
These condensed interim consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification
of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities and the reported expenses and comprehensive loss that might be necessary
should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. These adjustments could be material. 

The
properties in which the Company currently has an interest are in pre-revenue stage. As such, the Company is dependent on external
financing to fund its activities. In order to carry out the planned development and cover administrative costs, the Company will use its existing working capital and raise additional amounts as needed. Although the Company has been successful in its
past fundraising activities, there is no assurance as to the success of future fundraising efforts or as to the sufficiency of funds
raised in the future. The Company will continue to assess new properties and seek to acquire interests in additional properties if
there is sufficient geologic or economic potential and if adequate financial resources are available to do so.

The
following is a description of the Company s exploration and evaluation assets and the related spending commitments. 

Botswana
Assets - Selebi and Selkirk 

In
September 2021, the Company executed the Selebi Asset Purchase Agreement the Selebi APA with the BCL liquidator
to acquire the Selebi Mines formerly operated by BCL. In January 2022, the Company closed the transaction and ownership of the Selebi
Mines transferred to the Company. 

Pursuant
to the Selebi APA, the aggregate purchase price payable to the seller for the Selebi Mines shall be the sum of (USD ),
which amount shall be paid in instalments: 

(USD payable on the closing date, and payment of care and maintenance funding
 contributions in respect of the Selebi Mines from March 22, 2021 to the closing date of
 (USD ). These payments have been made. 

(USD payable upon the earlier of: (a) approval by the Botswana Ministry of Mineral Resources, Green Technology and Energy Security
 MMRGTES of the Company s Section 42 and Section 43 applications (for the further extension of the
 mining license and conversion of the mining license into an operating license, respectively), and (b) on the expiry date of the
 study phase, January 31, 2026, which pursuant to the Selebi APA has been extended for one year from the original expiry date of
 January 31, 2025. This extension follows successful completion by the Company of the work and investment milestones required by the
 Selebi APA. 

(USD payable on the completion of mine construction and production start-up (commissioning)
 by the Company on or before January 31, 2030, but not later than after the approval
 by the Minister of MMRGTES of the Company s Section 42 and Section 43 applications.

Notes
to the Unaudited Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements 

 For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

 (Expressed
in Canadian dollars) 

The
total acquisition cost of the Selebi Mines included the first instalment of (USD and the payment of the care and
maintenance funding contribution of (USD ). As per the terms and conditions of the Selebi APA, the Company has the
option to cancel the second and third payments and return the Selebi Mines to the liquidator if the Company determines
that the Selebi Mines are not economical. The Company also has an option to pay in advance the second and third payments if the Company determines that the Selebi Mines are economical. 

In
addition to the Selebi APA, the purchase of the Selebi Mines is also subject to a contingent consideration agreement as well as a royalty
agreement with the liquidator. 

The
Company also negotiated a separate asset purchase agreement (the Selkirk APA with the liquidator of TNMC in
January 22 to acquire the Selkirk deposit and related infrastructure formerly operated by TNMC. The transaction
closed in August 2022. 

The
Selkirk APA does not provide for a purchase price or initial payment for the purchase of the assets. The acquisition cost of the
Selkirk Mine of 
(USD was the care and maintenance funding contribution from April 1, 2021 to the closing date of the Selkirk APA. The Selkirk APA
provides that if the Company elects to develop the Selkirk Mine first, the payment of the second Selebi instalment of 
(USD would be upon the approval by the Minister of MMRGTES of the Company s Section 42 and Section 43 applications (for the further
extension of the Selkirk mining license and conversion of the Selkirk mining license into an operating license, respectively). For
the third Selebi instalment of 
(USD ),
if the Selkirk Mine were to be commissioned earlier than the Selebi Mines, the payment would trigger on the Selkirk Mine s
commission date. 

In
August 2023, the Company entered into a binding commitment letter with the liquidator of BCL, which is subject to customary final documentation,
to acquire a interest in two additional deposits Phikwe South and the Southeast Extension located adjacent to and immediately north of the Selebi North shaft. The impact is to increase the Selebi mining license area. While the

addition, the value of cash and other financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies can fluctuate with changes
in currency exchange rates. 

The
Company primarily operates in Canada, Barbados and Botswana and undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currencies such as the
United States dollar and Botswana Pula, and consequently is exposed to exchange rate risks. Exchange rate risks are managed by matching
levels of foreign currency balances and related obligations and by maintaining operating cash accounts in non-Canadian dollar currencies.

Credit
Risk 

Credit
risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to discharge an
obligation. The Company s credit risk is primarily associated with liquid financial assets. The Company limits exposure to
credit risk on liquid financial assets by holding cash and cash equivalents at highly-rated financial institutions. 

Liquidity
Risk 

Liquidity
risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are
settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Company manages the liquidity risk inherent in these financial
obligations by regularly monitoring actual cash flows against its annual budget, which forecasts expected cash availability to meet
future obligations. 

The
Company will defer discretionary expenditures, as required, in order to manage and conserve cash required for current liabilities.

Capital
Risk Management 

The
Company manages its capital to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern, so that adequate funds are available or are
scheduled to be raised to meet its ongoing administrative and operating costs and obligations. This is achieved by the Board of Directors 
review and ultimate approval of budgets that are achievable within existing resources, and the timely matching and release of the next
stage of expenditures with the resources made available from capital raises and debt funding from related or other parties. In doing
so, the Company may attempt to issue new shares, restructure or issue new debt. Although the Company has been successful in its past equity capital raises and debt funding, there is no assurance
that the Company will be able to continue successfully raising equity capital or debt funding in the same manner in the future.

Summary
of Activities 

In
2023, PNRL commenced its Phase 2 drill program undertaking a combination of resource and continued exploration drilling at the Selebi
Mines to demonstrate the size potential of the Selebi Mines mineral system, with the aim of establishing an initial mineral resource
estimate MRE on the Selebi Mines (the Initial MRE that will serve as the basis for future
engineering studies. The resource drilling at the Selebi Mines commenced underground from the Selebi North infrastructure in August 2023
and is currently ongoing with three drills turning. Assay results for completed holes are released as they are received and confirmed
by the Company. 

On
September 20, 2024, the Company filed the Initial MRE for its Selebi Mines in accordance with Canadian standards. The Initial MRE reflects
a significant expansion of the 2016 historic estimate. 

During
the third quarter and up to November 10, 2024, the Company has drilled approximately 17,167 metres in 36 holes at Selebi North. Assays
for a total of 30,915 metres across 71 completed holes, with 3 more in progress, have not been accounted for in the Initial
MRE. These assay results will continue to be released as they are received and confirmed by the Company. 

The
Company plans to continue its work at the Selkirk Mine and its surrounding prospecting licences, which is the Company s second
asset in Botswana, located approximately 75 kilometres north of the Selebi Mines. The focus of this work will be to understand the legacy
work done by previous owners, which had advanced the Selkirk Mine to a bankable feasibility study for re-development as an open pit mine. 

The
Company s Q3 2024 activities included a re-sampling program of historical drill core to support a MRE in respect of the Selkirk
Mine, anticipated to be delivered in Q4 2024. In 2023, the Company completed test work to evaluate an alternative ore processing and
tailings management strategy to those used in previous economic studies, the results of which are set forth in the Selkirk Technical
Report (as defined herein). 

For
more information relating to the contemplated activities and milestones for the Mines, please see Exploration
and Evaluation Activities below.

Exploration 

Exploration
work completed at the Selebi Mines from 2021 to October 2024 consisted of the sourcing and digitization of existing historical information,
confirming collar and down hole location information of selected historical holes, and drilling. PNRL also completed gyro, electromagnetic
surveys BHEM ), televiewer, and downhole physical property surveys on selected high priority historical and recent
exploration holes. A focused structural model over a portion of the Selebi deposit was developed by SRK Consulting Ltd. SRK ),
and a 3D model of mineralization for use in targeting was created at Selebi North by SLR. 

In
August 2023, an underground drilling program at Selebi North was initiated, which is currently active with three drills turning. As of
November 10, 2024, a total of 60,899 metres has been completed in 156 holes from eight underground drill bays, with three of those holes currently
in progress. This new drilling is a combination of infill and exploration drilling to follow the extension of the mineralization down
dip and down plunge. The core is sampled and sent to ALS Chemex in Johannesburg for analysis. Assay results are reported as they are
received. All holes are surveyed with a gyro instrument and selected holes are surveyed with borehole electromagnetics. To date, a total
of 59 underground holes have been surveyed.

Mineral
Processing and Metallurgical Testing 

The
historical BCL operations consisted of an integrated mining, concentrating and smelting complex which operated for over 40 years over
the Selebi Phikwe project area. The smelter processed Selebi and Phikwe concentrates and toll treated nickel concentrates received from
the Nkomati Nickel Mine and the Phoenix Mine. The concentrator plant and smelter were placed on care and maintenance in 2016 and are
located adjacent to the Selebi Mines at the historical Phikwe Mine. 

PNRL
intends to use pre-concentration methods to separate the minerals from waste materials to produce a mill feed and flotation to produce
a concentrate for commercial sale, or for further refining, and does not plan to restart the existing concentrator or smelter. Concentrate
options will be investigated in the next phase of work and include a bulk concentrate and separate nickel and copper concentrates. In
2021, PNRL carried out due diligence work that included metallurgical sampling and testing. Metallurgical study programs were carried
out by SGS Canada Inc. SGS in Lakefield, Ontario in 2021 and 2023 for separate copper and nickel concentrate production
at a conceptual level. The conceptual process flowsheet developed by SGS includes the key unit operations of crushing, grinding, and
flotation. 

PNRL
and DRA collaborated in the analyses of historical data collected on key flotation parameters observed in the production of separate
nickel and copper concentrates, such as metal upgrade ratios and mass pull, to simulate estimated metal grades and recoveries for bulk
concentrate. 

Selkirk
Mine, Botswana 

The
Selkirk Mine is located in the northeast of Botswana approximately 28 km southeast of the city of Francistown, and 450 km northeast of
the national capital Gaborone. 

The
Selkirk Mine is accessed year-round via paved and gravel roads from Gaborone and Francistown. The Selkirk Mine infrastructure includes
relict surface infrastructure supporting the historical underground mine, and the original decline. The Selkirk Mine is quite flat, and
beyond the mine footprint is covered in grassland with dispersed and clustered trees typical of a tree savanna biome. 

The
Selkirk Mine consists of a single mining licence covering an area of 1,458 hectares (14.58 km2) and four prospecting licences covering
a total of 12,670 hectares (126.7 km2). The mining licence, 2022/7L, is centred approximately at 21 19 13 S and 27 44 17 
E and is held by PNGPL, a subsidiary of PNRL. The mining licence was renewed for ten years commencing on May 27, 2022, ending on May
26, 2032. The four prospecting licences (PL050/2010, PL051/2010, PL210/2010, and PL071/2011) are currently being renewed and are expected to be valid to September 30, 2026. 

Exploration 

Exploration
work completed by PNRL to date has consisted of the sourcing and digitization of existing historical information, confirming collar
location information on selected historical holes, re-logging selected drill core, sampling mineralized drill core found untouched
on surface, and submitting a number of samples for proof-of-concept metallurgical testing. PNRL has engaged SLR to complete an MRE.
Following the data verification exercise, the Company has resampled core in from 17 holes to obtain additional PGM analyses to be
used in the MRE at the Selkirk Mine. Re-sampled core was sent to ALS Chemex in Johannesburg for analysis.

 Co, US 2,716.85/troy ounce Au, US 1,017.20/troy ounce Pt and US 1,048.50/troy ounce Pd with no adjustments for recoveries or payabilities. 
 
 (3) 
 NiEq was calculated using
 the formula NiEq=Ni+0.58 CuEq. 

Exploration programs have also been ongoing at the
prospecting licences located adjacent to the Selkirk mining licence, with a differential Global Positioning System of seven historical
drillhole collars and two surface electromagnetics surveys completed in Q2 2024. The strongest electromagnetic anomaly occurs over the Rooikoppie Prospect,
a gossan that was targeted by BCL drill holes. These five holes were located, Differential Global Positioning System coordinates collected, and two holes, DRKP001 and 002, were sampled in
Q3 2024. Assays showed no significant results in Ni, Cu, or PGEs.

Mineral
Processing and Metallurgical Testing 

PNRL
intends to use flotation to produce a concentrate for commercial sale or for further refining. Concentrate options will be investigated
in the next phase of work and include a bulk concentrate and separate nickel and copper concentrates. Metallurgical study programs were
carried out by SGS in Lakefield, Ontario in 2021 and 2023 for separate copper and nickel concentrate production at a conceptual level.
The conceptual process flowsheet developed by SGS includes the key unit operations of crushing, grinding, and flotation. 

PNRL
analyzed select SGS test results on key flotation parameters observed in the production of separate nickel and copper concentrates to
simulate estimated metal grades and recoveries for bulk concentrate. The area is in a rural district and the available infrastructure
is minimal. Strategic services (e.g., electricity and water supplies) could be provided by the Botswana Power Corporation and from existing
governmental water pipelines within the Francistown Road Reserve, and potable water could be sourced on site from boreholes. A railway
line crosses the western margin of the Selkirk area. 

Maniitsoq
Nickel-Copper-PGM Project, Southwest Greenland 

The
Maniitsoq project is centred on the 75 kilometre by 15 kilometre Greenland Norite Belt which hosts numerous high-grade nickel-copper
sulphide occurrences associated with mafic and ultramafic intrusions. The property is located 100 kilometres north of Nuuk, the capital
of Greenland, and is accessible year-round either by helicopter or by boat from Nuuk or Maniitsoq, the latter located on the coast approximately
15 kilometres to the west. The Company acquired the Maniitsoq project in 2011 due to its potential for the discovery of significant magmatic
sulfide deposits in a camp-scale belt. The Maniitsoq property consists of three exploration licences, Sulussagut No. 2011/54 and Ininngui
No. 2012/28, comprising 2,182 and 110.9 square kilometres, respectively, and the Carbonatite property No. 2018/21 (63 square kilometres),
and a prospecting licence, No. 2020/05, for West Greenland. The Greenland properties have no mineral resources or reserves. Mineral exploration
licence MEL 2018/21 and prospecting licence 2020/05 are in effect until December 31, 2024. MEL 2011/54 expires
December 31, 2025, while MEL 2012/28 expires December 31, 2026. 

Exploration
Activities 

Remaining targets were reviewed and prioritized in preparation for a potential
field program in 2023, which was deferred. No
exploration work was carried out in Greenland to date in 2024. 

No
material expenditures or activities are contemplated on the Maniitsoq property at this time. 

Canadian
Nickel Projects - Sudbury, Ontario 

Post
Creek Property 

The
Post Creek property is located 35 kilometres east of Sudbury in Norman, Parkin, Alymer and Rathburn townships and consists of 73 unpatented
mining claim cells in two separate blocks, covering a total area of 912 hectares held by the Company. The Company acquired the property
through an option agreement in April 2010, which was subsequently amended in March 2013. As at the date of this MD A, the Company
holds a 100 interest in the Post Creek property and is obligated to pay advances on a net smelter return of 10,000 per annum, which
will be deducted from any payments to be made under the net smelter return. 

The
Post Creek property lies adjacent to the Whistle Offset Dyke Structure which hosts the past producing Whistle Offset and Podolsky
Cu-Ni-PGM mines. Post Creek lies along an interpreted northeast extension of the corridor containing the Whistle Offset Dyke and Footwall
deposits and accounts for a significant portion of all ore mined in the Sudbury nickel district and, as such, represents favourable exploration
targets. Key lithologies are Quartz Diorite and metabreccia related to offset dykes and Sudbury Breccia associated with Footwall rocks
of the Sudbury Igneous Complex which both represent potential controls on mineralization. 

39 

No
exploration work was completed to date in 2024 on the Post Creek Property. The claims have sufficient work credits to keep them in good
standing until 2027. No material expenditures or activities are contemplated on the Post Creek property at this time. 

Halcyon
Property 

The
Halcyon property is located 35 kilometres northeast of Sudbury in the Parkin and Aylmer townships and consists of 63 unpatented mining
cells for a total of 864 hectares. Halcyon is adjacent to the Post Creek property and is approximately 2 kilometres north of the producing
Podolsky Mine of FNX Mining. The property was acquired through an option agreement and as at the date of this MD A, the Company holds
a 100 interest in the Halcyon property and is obligated to pay advances on a net smelter return of 8,000 per annum, which will be deducted
from any payments to be made under the net smelter return. 

No
exploration work was completed on the Halcyon Property to date in 2024. The claims are in good standing through 2027. No material expenditures
or activities are contemplated on the Halcyon property at this time. 

Quetico
Property 

The
Quetico property is located within the Thunder Bay Mining District of Ontario and in January 2024 consisted of 99 claim cells in two
blocks. Cells were acquired to assess: (a) the Quetico Sub-province corridor, which hosts intrusions with Ni-Cu-Co-PGM mineralization
related to a late 2690 Ma Archean magmatic event; and (b) the Neoproterozoic (1100 Ma MCR) magmatic event and related intrusions. 

No
work was carried out on the Quetico property in 2024. The last remaining claims expired on April 26, 2024. 

Financial
Capability 

The Company, being in the exploration stage, is subject to risks and challenges
similar to companies in a comparable stage of exploration and development. These risks include the challenges of securing adequate capital
for exploration and advancement of the Company s material projects, operational risks inherent in the mining industry, and global
economic and metal price volatility, and there is no assurance management will be successful in its endeavors. As at September 30, 2024,
the Company had no source of operating cash flows, nor any credit line currently in place. 

As
at September 30, 2024, the Company had working capital (calculated as total current assets less total current liabilities) of 15,092,693
(December 31, 2023 14,999,619) and reported an accumulated deficit of 135,712,148 (December 31, 2023 104,566,816). 

As at
September 30, 2024, the Company had 17,358,377 in available cash (December 31, 2023 19,245,628). There are no sources of
operating cash flows. The properties in which the Company currently has an interest are in the pre-revenue stage. As such, the
Company is dependent on external financing to fund its activities. In order to carry out the planned development and cover
administrative costs, the Company will need to use its existing working capital and raise additional amounts as needed. Subject to
any changes in the Company s operational plan, the Company has the funds to complete its planned mineral resource estimate for
the Selkirk Mine, and to advance underground exploration drilling and studies at the Selebi Mines into the first half of 2025.
Although the Company has been successful in its past fundraising activities, there is no assurance as to the success of future
fundraising efforts or as to the sufficiency of funds raised in the future.

Net
Loss 

The
net loss of 31,145,332 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was higher by 8,945,819 compared to the prior year comparable period
net loss of 22,199,513 largely due to increased exploration activities relating to the Botswana assets, the interest expense on a
three-year term loan (the Term Loan with Cymbria Corporation Cymbria ), and an increase in
share-based payments. 

Total
Assets 

Total
assets as at September 30, 2024 decreased by 682,137 from the December 31, 2023 balance. Lower cash balances in the current period
and depreciation of property, plant and equipment were largely offset by the purchase of spare parts from BCL. 

41 

Current
Liabilities and Non-Current Financial Liabilities 

Current
liabilities as at September 30, 2024 decreased by 311,473 from December 31, 2023 due to a decrease in lease liabilities resulting from
the repayment of interest and principal on the Syringa Lodge lease. Non-current financial liabilities as at September 30, 2024 increased
by 798,200 from December 31, 2023 as a result of the accretion of costs associated with the Term Loan. 

Overall
Performance and Results of Operations 

As at the date of this Report, the Company has not earned revenue nor proved
the economic viability of its projects. The Company s expenses are not subject to seasonal fluctuations or general trends other than factors
affecting costs such as inflation and input prices. The Company s expenses and cash requirements will fluctuate from period to period
depending on the level of activity at the projects, which may be influenced by the Company s ability to raise capital to fund these activities.
Comparisons of activity made between periods should be viewed with this in mind. The Company s quarterly results may be affected by many
factors such as timing of exploration activity, share-based payment costs, capital raised, marketing activities and other factors that
affect the Company s exploration, evaluation and re-development activities.

following table summarizes the Company s Operations for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and September

General
 and administrative expenses increased by 378,133 and 406,157 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,
 respectively, mainly due to higher travel and marketing costs as well as higher professional fees relating to additional regulatory
 reporting requirements in 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 2,708,304 of the general and administrative expenses
 were related to management fees, office costs, insurance fees, consulting fees, and various other overhead expenses at the Mines
 (nine months ended September 30, 2023 - 2,694,115). 

Depreciation 
 increased by 203,081 and 847,223 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively,
 due to property, plant and equipment acquisitions in late 2023 which started to depreciate in 2024. 

General
 exploration expenses increased by 2,988,188 and 5,345,605 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,
 respectively, as the Company ramped-up drilling, geophysics, engineering, and other activities at the Mines over the
 year. 

42 

Share-based
 payments represents the Company s long-term incentive program compensation granted to employees, directors, officers and consultants.
 Share-based payment was 933,619 and 1,712,843 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to
 nil in 2023. 

DSUs granted, net , or deferred share units, represents the Company s long-term incentive program compensation granted to directors of the Company, net of period end mark to market adjustments. The decrease of 87,926 and 149,934 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, is due to downward mark to market adjustments on outstanding units resulting from a decrease in the Company s share price, partially offset by an increase in size of the Board of Directors. 

Interest
 income and expense represents interest income earned on cash and cash equivalent deposits and interest expense on the
 Company s lease liabilities. Net interest income increased by 150,568 and 217,839 for the three and nine months ended
 September 30, 2024, respectively, as the Company held higher cash balances arising from the June 2024 Financing in guaranteed investment certificates. Further,
 the final installment on the drilling equipment lease was paid in April 2024, resulting in lower interest expense for the current
 year periods. 

Interest and financing cost on debt comprises the accrued interest on the Company s debt instruments, as well as the accretion of related transaction costs and fees. The increase of 68,732 and 906,354 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, relates to the additional 5.9 million of principal on the Term Loan that was added in December 2023.

Activities 

Net
cash used in operating activities YTD 2024 increased by 3,454,621 compared to YTD 2023, a result of a ramp-up in drilling,
geophysics, engineering, and other activities at the Mines over the year. 

Investing
Activities 

Key
investing activities relate to the acquisition of property, plant and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities YTD 2024
decreased by 3,231,309 compared to YTD 2023. The higher spending in YTD 2023 was related to the upfront purchase of tools and parts
for the three drills which were leased in 2023. 

43 

Financing
Activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities YTD 2024 decreased by 5,287,994 compared to YTD 2023. During the first nine months of 2023, the
Company obtained a term loan for gross proceeds of approximately 15.0 million and closed private placements for gross proceeds of approximately
 24.0 million, using a portion of those funds to repay a 7.0 million promissory note from Pinnacle Island LP. During the first nine
months of 2024, the Company closed private placements for gross proceeds of approximately 27.5 million, and had no additional borrowings. 

Liquidity 

Capital
Resources 

As
at September 30, 2024, the Company had 17,358,377 in available cash (December 31, 2023 19,245,628). The Company has no sources
of operating cash flows. Subject to any changes in the Company s operational plan, the Company
has the funds to complete its planned mineral resource estimate for the Selkirk Mine, and to advance underground exploration drilling
and studies at the Selebi Mines into the first half of 2025. Given the Company s
current financial position and the ongoing exploration and evaluation expenditures, the Company will need to raise additional
capital through the issuance of equity or other available financing alternatives to continue funding its
operating, exploration and evaluation activities, and re-development of its mineral properties. Although the Company has been
successful in its past fund-raising activities, there is no assurance as to the success of future fundraising efforts or as to the
sufficiency of funds raised in the future. 

Going
Concern 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred a loss of 12,004,960 and reported an accumulated deficit of
 135,712,148 as at September 30, 2024 (December 31, 2023 104,566,816). At the end of Q3 2024, the Company required
additional funds to continue its planned operations and meet its future obligations, commitments and forecasted expenditures through
September 30, 2025. Management is aware, in making its assessment, of material uncertainties related to events and conditions that
may cast a substantial doubt upon the Company s ability to continue as a going concern, and accordingly, the appropriateness
of the use of accounting principles applicable to a going concern. The accompanying Financial Statements do not include any
adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities, and the
reported expenses and comprehensive loss that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. These adjustments could be material. In assessing whether a going concern assumption is appropriate,
management considers all available information about the future, which is at least, but not limited to, twelve months from the end
of the reporting period. 

Financings 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company completed the following financing transactions: 

On

The net proceeds of the June 2024 Financing will be used by the Company
to advance the exploration and development of the Mines in Botswana and for general corporate and working capital purposes. See Use
of Proceeds for more details. 

44 

On
December 14, 2023, the Company closed a financing (the December 2023 Financing comprised of a brokered private
placement of units (the Private Placement and an amended Term Loan. The Private Placement was entered into by
the Company with Cormark Securities Inc. and BMO Capital Markets, as co-lead agents, and Canaccord Genuity Corp., Fort Capital

Working
Capital 

As
at September 30, 2024, the Company had a positive working capital of 15,092,693 (December 31, 2023 14,999,619). The marginal
increase in working capital is mainly due to an increase in spare parts inventory, partially offset by a decrease in lease liabilities. 

Contractual
Obligations and Contingencies 

Selebi
Mines 

As
per the Selebi APA, the aggregate purchase price payable to the seller for the Selebi Mines is the sum of USD 56,750,000 which
amount shall be paid in three instalments: 

USD
 1,750,000 payable on the closing date, and payment of care and maintenance funding contributions in respect of the Selebi Mines
 from March 22, 2021 to the closing date of USD 5,178,747. These payments have been made. 

USD
 25,000,000 upon the earlier of: (a) approval by the Botswana Ministry of Mineral Resources, Green Technology and Energy Security
 MMRGTES of the Company s Section 42 and Section 43 applications (for the further extension of the
 mining licence and conversion of the mining licence into an operating licence, respectively); and (b) on the expiry date of the
 study phase, January 31, 2026, which pursuant to the Selebi APA has been extended for one year from the original expiry date of
 January 31, 2025. This extension follows successful completion by the Company of the work and investment milestones required by the
 Selebi APA. 

The
 third instalment of USD 30,000,000 is payable on the completion of mine construction and production start-up by the Company on or
 before January 31, 2030, but not later than four years after the approval by the Minister of MMRGTES of the Company s Section
 42 and Section 43 applications. 

As
per the terms and conditions of the Selebi APA, the Company has the option to cancel the second and third payments and return the
Selebi Mines to the liquidator if the Company determines that the Selebi Mines are not economical. The Company also has an
option to pay in advance the second and third payments if the Company determines that the Selebi Mines are economical. The
Company s accounting policy is to measure and record contingent consideration when the conditions associated with the contingency
are met. As of September 30, 2024, none of the conditions of the second and third instalments have been met, hence these amounts are not accrued
in the Financial Statements. 

In
addition to the Selebi APA, the purchase of the Selebi Mines is also subject to a contingent compensation agreement as well as a royalty
agreement with the liquidator. 

Phikwe
South and the Southeast Extension 

In
August 2023, the Company announced that it had entered into a binding commitment letter with the liquidator of BCL to acquire a 100 
interest in two additional deposits, Phikwe South the Southeast Extension, located adjacent to and immediately north of the Selebi North
historical workings. The acquisition of the Phikwe South and the Southeast Extension deposits is subject to customary closing conditions
and is expected to close in Q4 2024. 

The
upfront cost to the Company to acquire these additional mineral properties is US 1,000,000. In addition, the Company has agreed to additional
work commitments of US 5,000,000 in the aggregate over the next four years. As a result of the extension of the Selebi mining licence,
the remaining asset purchase obligations of the Company outlined in the Selebi APA will each increase by 10 , US 5,500,000 in total,
while the trigger events remain unchanged. 

Selkirk
Mine 

In
regard to the Selkirk Mine, the purchase agreement does not provide for a purchase price or initial payment for the purchase of the
assets. The Selkirk purchase agreement provides that if the Company elects to develop Selkirk first, the payment of the second
Selebi instalment of US 25 million would be due upon the approval by the Minister of MMRGTES of the Company s Section 42 and
Section 43 applications (for the further extension of the Selkirk mining licence and conversion of the Selkirk mining licence into
an operating licence, respectively). For the third Selebi instalment of US 30 million, if Selkirk were commissioned earlier than
Selebi, the payment would trigger on Selkirk s commission date. 

46 

Right-of-Use
Assets 

On
July 9, 2022, the Company executed a sales agreement with Tuli Tourism Pty Ltd. the Seller for the Syringa Lodge in
Botswana and obtained possession of the property in August 2022. Pursuant to the agreement, the aggregate purchase price payable to the Seller
shall be the sum of 3,213,404 (BWP 30,720,000), payable in three installments. A deposit of 482,011 (BWP 4,608,000) was paid in August
2022, and a second installment of 1,306,906 (BWP 13,056,000) was paid in July 2023. On September 12, 2024, the sales agreement was amended
and the Company paid 50 of the final installment of 653,061 (BWP 6,528,000) with the remaining balance of 665,203 (BWP 6,528,000)
due on November 30, 2024. Title of the asset transfers to the Company upon payment of the remaining balance. All other terms and conditions
remained the same. 

On
March 14, 2023, the Company entered into a drilling equipment supply agreement with Forage Fusion Drilling Ltd. Forage of Hawkesbury, Ontario to purchase specific drilling equipment on a rent to own basis with the purchase price to be paid
in monthly payments. Pursuant to the agreement, the aggregate purchase price payable to Forage is 2,942,000. A payment of 1,700,000
was paid in March 2023 to purchase all the tooling, diamonds and critical spares required for 32,000 metres of drilling. The balance,
covering the purchase of the drills, was payable in twelve equal monthly instalments of 103,500. The equipment arrived at the site in
July 2023 and is now 100 owned by PNRL. 

Post
Creek 

Commencing
August 1, 2015, the Company is obligated to pay advances on the Post Creek net smelter return of 10,000 per annum. To date in 2024,
the Company paid 10,000, which will be deducted from any payments to be made under the net smelter return. 

Halcyon 

Commencing
August 1, 2015, the Company is obligated to pay advances on the Halcyon net smelter return of 8,000 per annum. To date in 2024, the
Company paid 8,000, which will be deducted from any payments to be made under the net smelter return. 

Contingencies 

There
are no environmental liabilities associated with the Mines as at the acquisition dates as all liabilities incurred prior to the
acquisitions are the responsibility of the sellers, BCL and TNMC, respectively. The Company has an obligation for the rehabilitation
costs arising subsequent to the acquisitions. As of September 30, 2024, management is not aware of or anticipating any contingent
liabilities that could impact the financial position or performance of the Company related to its exploration and evaluation
assets. 

The
Company s exploration and evaluation assets are affected by the laws and environmental regulations that exist in the various jurisdictions
in which the Company operates. It is not possible to estimate the future contingent liabilities and the impact on the Company s
operating results due to future changes in the Company s re-development of its projects or future changes in such laws and environmental
regulations.

4. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

We
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based
on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, management concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024 due to the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting
that were disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K, namely: lack of controls and process over significant estimates and judgment applied in
assessing complex accounting transactions; lack of segregation of duties over posting and reviewing complex accounting transactions;
and lack of communication between legal consultants and management related to SEC filing requirements. As a result of the material
weaknesses identified, we performed additional analysis and other post-closing procedures. Notwithstanding these material
weaknesses, management has concluded that the unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as at
September 30, 2024 in conformance with US GAAP. 

Remediation
of Previously Identified Material Weaknesses 

The
Company s management, under the oversight of the Audit Committee, has implemented corrective actions to remediate past control
deficiencies that contributed to certain material weaknesses, including obtaining specific resources to address the identified weaknesses.
As we continue to evaluate and enhance our internal control over financial reporting, we may determine that additional measures to address
the material weaknesses or adjustments to the remediation plan may be required. The material weaknesses will not be considered remediated
until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls
are operating effectively. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Except
as noted above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under
the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

We
have no knowledge of any material, active, pending or threatened legal, administrative or judicial proceeding against us or our subsidiaries,
nor are we, or any subsidiary, involved as a plaintiff or defendant in any material proceeding or pending litigation. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

Risks and other factors include those listed under Risk Factors 
in the 2023 Form 10-K and elsewhere in this Report, as well as the risk identified below. 

Lack
of Established Mineral Reserves 

The Company is a mineral exploration and development company that is focused
on the redevelopment of the previously producing Mines. To that end, the Company s properties have no established mineral reserves
at this time. While the Selebi project has an Initial MRE in accordance with Canadian standards, the Company has not yet established any
proven or probable mineral reserves on the Selebi Mines project. The lack of established mineral reserves means that the economic viability
of the Selebi project has not been confirmed. There is no assurance that further exploration will lead to the discovery of an economically
viable mineral deposit. 

Further, there is no assurance that any of the Company s projects
can be mined profitably. Accordingly, it is not assured that the Company will realize any profits in the short to medium term, if at all.
Any profitability in the future from the business of the Company will be dependent upon the development and commercial mining of economically
viable mineral deposits, which in itself is subject to numerous risk factors. 

The exploration and development of mineral deposits involves a high degree
of financial risk over a significant period of time that even a combination of management s careful evaluation, experience and knowledge
may not eliminate. Few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. Major expenses may be required to establish
resources and reserves by drilling and to construct mining and processing facilities at a particular site. It is impossible to ensure
that current work programs of the Company will result in profitable commercial mining operations. The profitability of the Company s
operations will be, in part, directly related to the cost and success of its work programs, which may be affected by a number of factors.
Substantial expenditures are required to establish mineral reserves that are sufficient to support commercial mining operations.
