of the Company s consolidated revenue. Revenue is typically recognized at a point in time when control transfers to the customer upon completion of professional services. These services generally involve a single distinct performance obligation. The consideration expected to be received in exchange for such services is normally the contractually stated amount. The Company occasionally sells separately priced non-standard/extended warranty services or preventative maintenance plans with the sale of products. The transfer of control over the service plans is over time. The Company recognizes the related revenue

 to . The Company recognizes estimated liabilities associated with standard warranty periods for its products in accordance with the provisions of ASC 450, Contingencies, as the Company has the ability to ascertain the likelihood of the liabilities and can reasonably estimate the amount of the liabilities. A provision for the estimated cost related to standard warranties is recorded as cost of revenue at the time revenue is recognized. The Company s estimate of the costs to service the warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions. To the extent that the Company s experience in warranty claims or costs associated with servicing those claims differ from the original estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities are recorded at that time, with offsetting adjustments to cost of revenue. Practical Expedients and Exemptions These costs are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. Contract Liabilities Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and advance payments from customers, including amounts that are refundable. These contract liabilities are classified as either current or long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet based on the timing of when the Company expects to recognize the related revenue. As of September 27, 2024 and December 31, 2023, contract liabilities were million and million, respectively, and are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The increase in the contract liability balance during the nine months ended September 27, 2024 is primarily due to cash payments received in advance of satisfying performance obligations, partially offset by million of revenue recognized during the period that was included in the contract liability balance as of December 31, 2023. Disaggregated Revenue See Note 16 for the Company s disaggregation of revenue by segment, geography and end market.

The segment sells these products directly, utilizing a highly technical sales force, and indirectly, through resellers and distributors. 
 End Markets 
 We primarily operate in two end markets: the medical market and the advanced industrial market. 
 Medical Market 
 For the nine months ended September 27, 2024, the medical market accounted for approximately 56 of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the medical market is generally affected by hospital and other healthcare provider capital spending, growth rates of surgical procedures, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, aggregation of purchasing by healthcare networks, changes in technology requirements, timing of OEM customers product development and new product launches, changes in customer or patient preferences, and general demographic trends. 
 28 

Advanced Industrial Market 
 For the nine months ended September 27, 2024, the advanced industrial market accounted for approximately 44 of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the advanced industrial market is affected by several factors, including changing technology requirements and preferences of our customers, productivity or quality investments in a manufacturing environment, financial conditions of our customers, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, and general economic conditions. We believe that the PMI on manufacturing activities specific to different regions around the world may provide an indication of the impact of general economic conditions on our sales into the advanced industrial market. 
 Strategy 
 Our strategy is to drive sustainable, profitable growth through short-term and long-term initiatives, including: 
 disciplined focus on our diversified business model of providing functionality to long life-cycle OEM customer platforms in attractive medical and advanced industrial niche markets; 

improving our business mix to increase medical sales as a percentage of total revenue by: 

- introducing new products aimed at attractive medical applications, such as minimally invasive and robotic surgery, ophthalmology, patient monitoring, drug delivery, clinical laboratory testing and life science equipment;

broadening our product and service offerings through the acquisition of innovative and complementary technologies and solutions in medical and advanced industrial technology applications; 

expanding sales and marketing channels to reach new target customers; 

improving our existing operations to expand profit margins and improve customer satisfaction by implementing lean manufacturing principles, strategic sourcing across our major production sites; and optimizing and limiting the growth of our fixed cost base; and 

attracting, retaining, and developing world-class talented, diverse, and motivated employees. 

Significant Events and Updates 
 Acquisition of Motion Solutions 
 On January 2, 2024, we completed the acquisition of Motion Solutions Parent Corp. Motion Solutions ), an Irvine, California-based provider of highly engineered integrated solutions, specializing in proprietary precision motion and advanced motion control solutions, for a total purchase price of 192.0 million in cash, net of working capital adjustments. The acquisition was financed with borrowings under our revolving credit facility. The addition of Motion Solutions enhances our product portfolio and further expands our presence in attractive medical and precision medicine spaces. The Motion Solutions acquisition is included in our Medical Solutions reportable segment. 
 Business Environment 
 Inflationary Pressures 
 During the nine months ended September 27, 2024, we continued to experience higher than normal inflation of raw material and component prices and labor costs. We have generally been able to offset increases in these costs through various productivity cost reduction initiatives, as well as increasing our selling prices to pass through some of these higher costs to our customers. Given the timing of our actions compared to the timing of these inflationary pressures, there may be periods during which we are unable to fully 
 29 

recover the increases in our costs. Additionally, the inflationary pressures gave rise to significant increases in interest rates in recent periods as various governments used monetary policy to contain and reduce inflation. As a result, our year to date weighted average interest rate increased from approximately 6.1 as of September 29, 2023 to approximately 6.7 as of September 27, 2024. These higher interest rates have caused access to credit to be more expensive and have impacted demand from some of our OEM customers, as they see some of their end market customers deferring new capital equipment orders due to the higher interest rate environment. 
 Geopolitical Conflicts 
 In February 2022, Russian forces invaded Ukraine. In response, the U.S., the European Union EU ), and several other countries imposed economic and trade sanctions and other restrictions (collectively, global sanctions targeting Russia and Belarus. Russia then imposed retaliatory economic measures against the U.S., the EU, and several other countries. Our historical sales to Russia were not material. We also do not have any assets, employees or third-party contractors in Russia or Ukraine. However, the duration of the conflict and further sanctions could have further impact on the global economy and inflation. 
 In early October 2023, Israel declared war on Hamas. We are monitoring the social, political and economic environment in Israel and in the region for any impact on our businesses. Our historical sales to Israel were around 1 of our total sales. We do not have any assets, employees, or third-party contractors in Israel. Due to the uncertainty around the duration of the conflict, future impacts are unknown to our businesses.

Gross profit and gross profit margin can be influenced by a number of factors, including product mix, pricing, volume, manufacturing efficiencies and utilization, costs for raw materials and outsourced manufacturing, trade tariffs, freight costs, headcount, inventory excess and obsolescence, and warranty expenses. 
 Precision Medicine and Manufacturing 
 Precision Medicine and Manufacturing segment gross profit for the three months ended September 27, 2024 decreased 9.2 million, or 25.3 , versus the prior year period, primarily due to a decrease in both revenue and gross profit margin. Precision Medicine and Manufacturing segment gross profit margin was 44.6 for the three months ended September 27, 2024, versus a gross profit margin of 50.8 for the prior year period. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to lower factory utilization due to a decline in production volumes and unfavorable product mix. 
 Precision Medicine and Manufacturing segment gross profit for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 decreased 17.6 million, or 16.5 , versus the prior year period, primarily due to a decrease in both revenue and gross profit margin. Precision Medicine and Manufacturing segment gross profit margin was 47.1 for the nine months ended September 27, 2024, versus a gross profit margin of 49.8 for the prior year period. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to lower factory utilization due to a decline in production volumes, and unfavorable product mix. 
 Medical Solutions 
 Medical Solutions segment gross profit for the three months ended September 27, 2024 increased 8.3 million, or 24.5 , versus the prior year period, primarily due to an increase in revenue. Medical Solutions segment gross profit margin was 40.8 for the three months ended September 27, 2024, which was unchanged from the prior year period. Gross profit margins were favorably impacted by higher factory productivity in our minimally invasive surgery and detection and analysis products, fully offset by the dilutive effect of the Motion Solutions acquisition on gross profit margin. 
 Medical Solutions segment gross profit for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 increased 22.0 million, or 21.9 , versus the prior year period, primarily due to an increase in revenue. Medical Solutions segment gross profit margin was 39.3 for the nine months ended September 27, 2024, versus a gross profit margin of 41.0 for the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to an inventory related charge associated with our visualization solutions product line closure, which resulted in a 0.8 percentage point reduction in gross profit margin, and higher amortization expense on intangible assets and inventory fair value adjustments primarily from the current year acquisition, which resulted in a 2.1 percentage point reduction in gross profit margin. Improved efficiency in factory productivity in our minimally invasive surgery and detection and analysis products, partially offset by the dilutive effect of the Motion Solutions acquisition on gross profit margin, resulted in a 1.2 percentage point increase in gross profit margin. 
 Robotics and Automation 
 Robotics and Automation segment gross profit for the three months ended September 27, 2024 increased 7.9 million, or 24.2 , versus the prior year period, primarily due to an increase in both revenue and gross profit margin. Robotics and Automation segment

Interest Income (Expense), Net 
 Net interest expense was 8.1 million for the three months ended September 27, 2024, versus 6.8 million for the prior year period. The increase in net interest expense was primarily due to an increase in average debt levels to fund the Motion Solutions acquisition and an increase in the weighted average interest rate on our senior credit facilities, partially offset by an increase in interest income. The weighted average interest rate on our senior credit facilities was 6.83 during the three months ended September 27, 2024, versus 6.68 during the prior year period. 
 Net interest expense was 24.6 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2024, versus 19.9 million for the prior year period.

 Income Tax Provision (Benefit) 
 Our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 27, 2024 was 20.8 , versus 7.7 for the prior year period. Our effective tax rate of 20.8 for the three months ended September 27, 2024 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions and R D tax credits, partially offset by disallowed compensation deductions, uncertain tax position accruals, and Pillar Two inclusion. 
 Our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 29, 2023 of 7.7 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, R D tax credits, and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of share-based compensation awards, partially offset by disallowed compensation deductions and uncertain tax position accruals. 
 Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 was 18.3 , versus 11.2 for the prior year period. Our effective tax rate of 18.3 for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible 
 35 

Income, U.K. patent box deductions, R D tax credits, and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of share based compensation awards, partially offset by disallowed compensation deductions, uncertain tax position accruals, and Pillar Two inclusion. For the nine months ended September 27, 2024, the tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards had a benefit of 3.1 on our effective tax rate. 
 Our effective tax rate of 11.2 for the nine months ended September 29, 2023 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, R D tax credits and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of share based compensation awards, partially offset by disallowed compensation deductions and uncertain tax position accruals. For the nine months ended September 29, 2023, the tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards had a benefit of 4.5 on our effective tax rate. 
 On December 12, 2022, the EU member states agreed to implement the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development s OECD Pillar Two Model Rules. These rules, which impose a global corporate minimum income tax rate of 15 , have been enacted or introduced in proposed legislation in 35 countries. Additional countries are actively considering changes to their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the OECD s proposals. We have estimated the impact of this minimum tax in our effective tax rate analysis, and it does not have a material impact on our financial results in the current period. We continue to closely monitor the progression of legislative activities. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities. Our primary ongoing cash requirements are funding operations, capital expenditures, investments in businesses, and repayment of our debt and related interest payments. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We believe our future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating and capital expenditure cash needs for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 12 months. The availability of borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility provides another potential source of liquidity for any future capital expenditures and other liquidity needs. In addition, we have the ability to expand our borrowing capacity by up to 350.0 million by exercising the accordion option under our revolving credit agreement. We may also seek to raise additional capital, which could be in the form of bonds, convertible debt or preferred or common equity, to fund business development activities or other future investing cash requirements, subject to approval by the lenders in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended, the Credit Agreement ). There is no assurance that such capital will be available on reasonable terms or at all. 
 Significant factors affecting the management of our ongoing cash requirements are the adequacy of available bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms. The sources of our liquidity are subject to all of the risks of our business and could be adversely affected by, among other factors, risks associated with events outside of our control, such as economic consequences of geopolitical conflicts, monetary policy changes in the U.S. and other countries and their impact on the global financial markets, a decrease in demand for our products, our ability to integrate current and future acquisitions, deterioration in certain financial ratios, availability of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and other market changes in general. See Risks Relating to Our Common Shares and Our Capital Structure included in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Our cash requirements primarily consist of principal and interest payments associated with our Senior Credit Facilities (as defined below), operating and finance leases, purchase commitments, and pension obligations. Such contractual obligations are described in our Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, each included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Through September 27, 2024, we have not entered into any other material new or modified contractual obligations since December 31, 2023. 
 Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund our operations may be dependent upon the operating income and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries. However, as local laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness restrict certain of our subsidiaries from paying dividends and transferring assets to us, there is no assurance that our subsidiaries will be permitted to provide us with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans when necessary. 
 As of September 27, 2024, 55.9 million of our 92.7 million cash and cash equivalents was held by subsidiaries outside of Canada and the U.S. Generally, our intent is to use cash held in these foreign subsidiaries to fund our local operations or acquisitions by those local subsidiaries and to pay down borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities. Approximately 93.8 million of our outstanding term loan and revolver borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities were held in our subsidiaries outside of Canada and the U.S. as of September 27, 2024. Additionally, we may use intercompany loans to address short-term cash flow needs for various subsidiaries. 
 36 

Senior Credit Facilities 
 In December 2019, we entered into the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended from time to time, the Credit Agreement ), originally consisting of a 100.0 million U.S. dollar equivalent euro-denominated (approximately 90.2 million) 5-year term loan facility and a 350.0 million 5-year revolving credit facility (collectively, the Senior Credit Facilities ). The Senior Credit Facilities had an original maturity date of December 2024 and included an uncommitted accordion option pursuant to which the commitments under the revolving credit facility may be increased by an additional 200.0 million in aggregate, subject to certain customary conditions. The term loan facility requires quarterly scheduled principal repayments of approximately 1.1 million beginning in March 2020 with the remaining principal balance due upon maturity. We may make additional principal payments at any time, which will reduce the next quarterly installment payment due. We may pay down outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility with cash on hand and cash generated from future operations at any time. 
 On March 27, 2020, we entered into an amendment (the First Amendment to the Credit Agreement and exercised a portion of the uncommitted accordion option. The First Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Credit Agreement by 145.0 million, from 350.0 million to 495.0 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion option to 200.0 million for potential future expansion. 
 On October 5, 2021, we entered into an amendment (the Fourth Amendment to the Credit Agreement to exercise the accordion option. The Fourth Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Credit Agreement by 200.0 million, from 495.0 million to 695.0 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion option to 200.0 million for potential future expansion. 
 On March 10, 2022, we entered into an amendment (the Fifth Amendment to the Credit Agreement to extend the maturity date thereof from December 31, 2024 to March 10, 2027, update the pricing grid, replace LIBOR with SOFR as the reference rate for U.S. dollar borrowings, and increase the uncommitted accordion option from 200 million to 350 million. 
 As of September 27, 2024, we had 76.6 million term loan and 383.8 million revolver borrowings outstanding under our Senior Credit Facilities. The borrowings outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities bear interest at rates based on (a) the Base Rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement, plus a margin ranging between 0.00 and 0.75 per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio, or (b) the Term SOFR Screen Rate, the Alternative Currency Daily Rate or the Alternative Currency Term Rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement, plus a margin ranging between 0.75 and 1.75 per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio. In addition, we are obligated to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility, ranging between 0.20 and 0.30 per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio. As of September 27, 2024, we had outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement denominated in Euro and U.S. dollars of 93.8 million and 366.5 million, respectively. 
 The Credit Agreement contains various covenants that we believe are usual and customary for this type of agreement, including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The following table summarizes these financial covenants and our compliance therewith as of September 27, 2024: 

Requirement

(1) Maximum consolidated leverage ratio shall be increased to 4.00 for four consecutive quarters following a designated acquisition, as defined in the Fifth Amendment. 
 Share Repurchase Plans 
 Our Board of Directors may approve share repurchase plans from time to time. Under these repurchase plans, shares may be repurchased at our discretion based on ongoing assessment of the capital needs of the business, the market price of our common shares, and general market conditions. Shares may also be repurchased through an accelerated share purchase agreement, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. Repurchases may be made under certain SEC regulations, which would permit common shares to be repurchased when we would otherwise be prohibited from doing so under insider trading laws. While the share repurchase plans are generally intended to offset dilution from equity awards granted to our employees and directors, the plans do not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common shares. No time limit is typically set for the completion of the share repurchase plans, and the plans may be suspended or discontinued at any time. We expect to fund share repurchases through cash on hand and cash generated from operations. 
 In February 2020, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan (the 2020 Repurchase Plan authorizing the repurchase of 50.0 million worth of common shares. Share repurchases have been made under the 2020 Repurchase Plan pursuant to 
 37 

Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We did not repurchase any shares during the nine months ended September 27, 2024. We had 49.5 million available for share repurchases under the 2020 Repurchase Plan as of September 27, 2024.

Operating Cash Flows 
 Cash provided by operating activities was 97.0 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2024, versus 81.1 million for the prior year period. Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 increased from the prior year period primarily as a result of less cash paid for income taxes. 
 Investing Cash Flows 
 Cash used in investing activities was 206.1 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2024, primarily driven by 191.2 million cash consideration, net of cash acquired and net working capital adjustments for the Motion Solutions acquisition. We also paid 14.9 million for capital expenditures. 
 Cash used in investing activities was 13.7 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2023, all related to capital expenditures. 
 We expect to use an aggregate of approximately 18 million to 20 million in 2024 for capital expenditures related to investments in new property, plant and equipment for our existing businesses. 
 Financing Cash Flows 
 Cash provided by financing activities was 92.6 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2024, primarily driven by 198.0 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund the Motion Solutions acquisition, partially offset by 96.0 million of term loan and revolving credit facility repayments and 8.9 million of payroll tax payments upon vesting of share-based compensation awards. 
 Cash used in financing activities was 92.8 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2023, primarily due to 82.0 million of term loan and revolving credit facility repayments and 10.2 million of payroll tax payments upon vesting of share-based compensation awards.
