Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking
statements. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report may be forward-looking statements.
The forward-looking statements are contained principally in the sections entitled Risk Factors, and Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, but are also contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.
In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as may, might, will, 
 should, expects, plans, anticipates, could, would, 
 intends, targets, projects, contemplates, believes, estimates, 
 predicts, potential or continue or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions.
Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause our actual results,
performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the
forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about: 

Failure of future market acceptance of our mobile esports products and services; 

Increased levels of competition; 

Changes in political, economic or regulatory conditions generally and in the markets in which we operate; 

Our ability to retain and attract senior management and other key employees; 

Our ability to protect our trade secrets or other proprietary rights, operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others and prevent others from infringing on the proprietary rights of the Company; and 

Other risks, including those described in the Risk Factors discussion. 

You should carefully review and consider the information
regarding certain factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results set forth under the heading
 Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. There have
been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed therein, except as set in the Risk Factors section of
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of important factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those
expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report are only predictions,
and we may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations included in our forward-looking statements. We have based these
forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe
may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Because forward- looking statements are inherently subject to
risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions
of future events. The events and circumstances reflected in our forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur and actual results
could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. 

These forward-looking statements speak only as of
the date of this Quarterly Report. While we may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we have
no current intention of doing so except to the extent required by applicable law. You should therefore not rely on these forward-looking
statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

ownership of K2 Gamer in November 2022 subject
to required approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan SECP ), which approval was granted in July 2023.
We acquired 90 of K2 Gamer so that it could be our operating subsidiary in Pakistan. 

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Gamer Pakistan and K2 Gamer (collectively, the Company ). Gamer
Pakistan owns a 90 controlling interest in K2 Gamer. The value of the non-controlling interest in K2 Gamer is immaterial. 

The functional currency of K2 Gamer is the Pakistan
Rupee PKR ). The assets and liabilities of K2 Gamer are translated to United States Dollars USD at period
end exchange rates, while statements of operations accounts are translated at the average exchange rate during the period. The effects
of foreign currency translation adjustments are included in other comprehensive loss, which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) in stockholders equity. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Interim financial statements 

The unaudited consolidated financial statements are prepared by the Company,
pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). The information furnished herein
reflects all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, which in the opinion of management, are necessary to fairly
state the Company s financial position, the results of its operations, and cash flows for the periods presented. Certain information
and footnote disclosures normally present in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America were omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The results of operations for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the year ending December 31, 2024. 

in an escrow account for up to 24 months from the closing of the IPO. During September 2024, the restriction on these funds was
removed and the Company entered into a note receivable agreement for 300,000 of the funds (See Note 4). As of September 30, 2024,
the remaining funds of approximately 112,000 remained in the escrow account and were released to the Company in October 2024.
Therefore, as of September 30, 2024, the funds were recorded as a current asset and as of December 31, 2023 they were recorded as a
noncurrent asset.

potentially dilutive securities outstanding at September 30, 2023. 

as of September 30, 2024. The Company had minimal revenue-generating operations from which it generated revenues through September 30, 2024.
The Company expects that it will operate at a loss for the foreseeable future. During October 2023, the Company raised gross
proceeds of approximately 
through its initial public offering IPO ), with net proceeds of approximately 
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions. 

Management believes the net proceeds from the
IPO will be sufficient to meet its cash, operational and liquidity requirements for at least months after the date of this annual
report. However, the Company anticipates that it will be required to raise additional funds through public or private equity
financings in the future to expand its business. Should such financing not be available in that time-frame, the Company might be
required to reduce its activities. 

While management of the Company believes that it will be successful in
its capital formation and planned operating activities, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional equity
capital or be successful in the development and commercialization of the products it develops or initiate collaboration agreements thereon.
However, the failure of the Company to achieve its business objectives could have a material adverse effect on the Company s results
of operations and could require the Company to need additional equity or debt financing to continue its operations. These conditions,
among other factors, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of
assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of the Company to continue as a going
concern.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

You should read the following discussion and analysis
of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing in
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion and other parts of this Quarterly Report contain forward-looking statements that
involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. As a result of many factors,
including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors section of this Quarterly Report, our actual results could differ
materially from the results described in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. 

Overview 

We are a development-stage interactive esports event
promotion and product marketing company, founded in November 2021. Our initial focus is on creating college, inter-college, inter-university
and professional esports events for men s and women s teams, particularly esports opportunities involving colleges and universities
in Pakistan. Though creating sports opportunities involving colleges and universities in Pakistan likely will remain our primary focus
for at least 12 months, thereafter, over time, we intend to expand the range of our esports offerings, expand to other markets and eventually
consider live sports. We will endeavor to integrate competitive events that include our teams and leagues with regional and global teams
and leagues sponsored by others, including companies formed by certain of our stockholders to promote sports, including esports, in other
countries. We have not conducted any operations ourselves, but conduct our operations in Pakistan through K2 Gamer, our 90 owned subsidiary
(such acquisition was entered into in November 2022 but was not approved by the SECP until July 2023), and ESP, the affiliate of K2 Gamer
with whom K2 Gamer has an assignment and consulting agreement. We acquired 90 of K2 Gamer so that it could be our operating subsidiary
in Pakistan. Mr. Muhammed Jamal Qureshi is an owner, CEO and a director of K2 Gamer and ESP. 

From inception in November 2021 through the present
date, we have focused on having K2 Gamer and/or ESP enter into agreements with universities to undertake esports tournaments endorsed
by the universities in which their students will participate, and for which the universities will provide marketing support, building
the necessary infrastructure for our business, and conducting initial tournaments. The purpose of our initial tournaments was to refine
our logistics and technology, demonstrate competence to universities, and provide a showcase to potential marketing partners, advertisers
and other sponsors. We have not yet generated any significant income, nor has K2 Gamer or ESP. 

During 2024, we anticipate that we will organize or
co-organize approximately 12 or more tournaments and we intend to commence solicitation of marketing partners, advertisers and other sponsors,
with the goal of beginning to generate revenue thereafter. There is no assurance that we will succeed in this endeavor, achieve revenues,
achieve revenues that exceed the cost of the tournaments, or generate a profit, based on our selling, general and administrative expenses. 

Recent Events 

Issuance of Common Stock in IPO 

During October 2023, we raised gross proceeds of approximately
 6,800,000 through our initial public offering IPO ), with net proceeds of approximately 5,835,000 after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions. In addition, the Company issued warrants to the underwriters to purchase up to 170,000 shares of the Company s
common stock at an exercise price of 5.20 per share. The warrants have a term of five years. 

On June 4, 2024, the Staff of Nasdaq notified Gamer
Pakistan Inc. Company that unless the Company timely requests a hearing before a Hearings Panel (the Panel ),
the Company s securities will be delisted from The Nasdaq Stock Market for the reasons set forth below. The Company timely requested
a hearing before the Panel, which hearing will be held on July 18, 2024. Nasdaq has granted the Company s request that any trading
suspension or delisting action be stayed through the hearing date. Pursuant to the Nasdaq Listing Rules, the Panel may grant an additional
extension period. However, there can be no assurance that the Panel will grant the Company an additional extension, or that the Company
will be able to regain compliance by the end of any additional extension period. 

The reason for the delisting notice is as follows: 

On December 4, 2023, Nasdaq had notified the Company
that the bid price of its listed security had closed at less than 1 per share over the previous 30 consecutive business days, and, as
a result, did not comply with Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the Rule ). In accordance with Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company
was provided 180 calendar days, or until June 3, 2024, to regain compliance with the Rule. The Company has not regained compliance with
the Rule and is not eligible for a second 180-day period, because the Company does not meet the 5,000,000 minimum stockholders 
equity requirement for initial listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market or any of the alternatives set forth under Listing Rule 5550(b).

Table of Contents 

Separately, on April 18 and May 17, 2024, the Staff
notified the Company that since it failed to file the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and the Form 10-Q for the period
ended March 31, 2024, the Company no longer met the filing requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Stock Market set forth under
Listing Rule 5250(c)(1). In light of the foregoing and in accordance with Listing Rule 5810(c)(2)(A), the Staff cannot accept a plan to
regain compliance. As such, these matters are an additional and separate basis for delisting the Company s securities from The Nasdaq
Stock Market. 

On August 5, 2024, the Company s was delisted
from the Nasdaq Stock Market. 

Due to the ongoing political and economic uncertainty
in Pakistan, the Company has decided to cease operations in Pakistan and reduce overhead expenses wherever possible while it continues
to seek alternative opportunities for the Company. 

Components of Statements of Operations 

Revenue and Cost of Revenue

General and Administrative Expenses 

General and administrative expenses were approximately
 508,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 166,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase
in general and administrative expenses was primarily driven by an increase of approximately 73,000 in consulting fees, 183,000 in professional,
accounting, legal and business development fees, 53,000 in payroll, 68,000 in board stipend and insurance fees, and approximately 32,000
of expenses in Pakistan, offset by a decrease of 70,000 in public filing fees. 

General and administrative expenses were approximately
 1,972,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 298,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase
in general and administrative expenses was primarily driven by an increase of approximately 452,000 in consulting fees, 645,000 in professional,
accounting, legal and business development fees, 273,000 in payroll, 182,000 in public filing fees, board stipend and insurance fees,
and approximately 116,000 of expenses in Pakistan. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash and restricted
cash of approximately 1,337,000 and 3,771,000, respectively. 

We have financed our operations through the issuance
of common stock. In October 2023, we issued 1,700,000 shares of common stock for total gross proceeds of 6,800,000 through an initial
public offering IPO ). We received net proceeds after commissions and fees of approximately 5,835,000. 

Funding Requirements 

We believe the net proceeds of the IPO will be sufficient to meet our cash,
operational and liquidity requirements for approximately the next 12 to 15 months. 

We cannot specify with certainty all of the particular
uses for the net proceeds to us from the IPO. Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in the application of these proceeds. 

We intend to use the net proceeds from the IPO for
operating expenses, marketing, event expenses, streaming, retention of additional staff in Pakistan, working capital and general corporate
purposes, including perhaps acquisitions of game licenses, technology platform agreements and strategic partnerships. Investors are cautioned,
however, that expenditures may vary substantially from these uses. Investors will be relying on the judgment of our management, who will
have broad discretion regarding the application of the proceeds of the IPO. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend
upon numerous factors, including the amount of cash generated by our operations and the amount of competition we face and other operational
factors. We may find it necessary or advisable to use portions of the proceeds from the IPO for other purposes. 

Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated
with establishing a new business in Pakistan, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our working capital requirements. Our future
funding requirements will depend on many factors, including without limitation: 

Failure of future market acceptance of our mobile esports products and services; 

Increased levels of competition; 

Changes in political, economic or regulatory conditions generally and in the markets in which we operate; 

Our ability to retain and attract senior management and other key employees; 

Our ability to protect our trade secrets or other proprietary rights, operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others and prevent others from infringing on the proprietary rights of the Company; and 

Other risks, including those described in the Risk Factors discussion. 

See Risk Factors for additional risks
associated with our substantial capital requirements.

Operating Activities 

Net cash used in operating activities increased by approximately 1,825,000
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to
an increase in general and administrative expenses of approximately 1,675,000 and a change in accounts payable and accrued expenses of
 118,000, prepaid expenses and other current assets of 25,000, and related party payable of approximately 44,000. 

Investing Activities 

Net cash used in investing activities increased by approximately 301,000
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to
the 300,000 loaned to WestPark Capital Group, LLC. 

Financing activities 

Net cash provided in financing activities decreased by approximately 293,000
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change was primarily due to approximately
 260,000 of proceeds from a related party note payable and 90,000 in advances from a related party received in the nine months ended
September 30, 2023 compared to nil proceeds in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This was offset by the payment of approximately
 57,000 of deferred offering costs in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to nil payments in the nine months ended September
30, 2024. 

JOBS Act 

As an emerging growth company under
the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended, or the JOBS Act, we can take advantage of an extended transition period for
complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting
standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected to opt out of this
provision and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards when they are required to be adopted by public companies
that are not emerging growth companies. 

Subject to certain conditions, as an emerging growth
company, we rely on certain of these exemptions, including without limitation: 

reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements; 

no advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements; and 

exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. 

We may take advantage of these exemptions for up to
five years or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company
on the date that is the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of 1.07
billion or more; (ii) the last day of 2027; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in nonconvertible
debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of
the SEC. We may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these exemptions. Accordingly, the information contained herein may be
different from the information you receive from other public companies in which you hold stock.

Smaller Reporting Company 

As a smaller reporting company, as defined
in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, in addition to providing reduced disclosure
about our executive compensation arrangements and business developments, among other reduced disclosure requirements available to smaller
reporting companies, we present only two years of audited financial statements in addition to any required unaudited interim financial
statements with correspondingly reduced Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
disclosure. Accordingly, the information contained herein may be different from the information you receive from other public companies
in which you hold stock. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We did not have during the periods presented, and
we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.

Not applicable. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

At September 30, 2024, management, with the
participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the
Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 

At September 30, 2024, management has not
completed an effective assessment of the Company s internal controls over financial reporting based on the 2013 Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) framework. Management has concluded that, during the period covered by this report, our internal
controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of U.S. GAAP. Management identified the following
material weaknesses set forth below in our internal control over financial reporting. 

1. We lack the necessary corporate accounting resources
to maintain adequate segregation of duties. 

2. We did not perform an effective risk assessment
or monitor internal controls over financial reporting or our cyber security environment. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION. 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 

We are not currently subject to any legal proceedings
or claims, however, we may become subject to legal proceedings and claims arising in connection with the normal course of our business. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

RISK FACTORS 

You should carefully review and consider the information
regarding certain factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results set forth under the heading
 Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. There have
been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed therein, except as set forth below;

Table of Contents 

We will require additional financing in order
to implement and execute our business plan, and we cannot be certain that such additional financing will be available on reasonable terms
when required, or at all. 

At September 30, 2024, we had a cash and restricted cash balance of approximately
 1,337,000. While management estimates this amount is sufficient to continue with operating activities over the next 12 months, we likely
will need to raise additional capital to fund our operations while we implement and execute our business plan and expand our business.
However, the failure of the Company to achieve its business objectives could have a material adverse effect on the Company s results
of operations and could require the Company to need additional equity or debt financing to continue its operations. These conditions,
among other factors, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

We currently do not have any contracts or commitments
for additional financing. Any future equity financing may involve substantial dilution to existing shareholders. There can be no assurance
that such additional capital will be available on a timely basis, or on terms acceptable to the Company. If adequate funds are not available
or are not available on acceptable terms when needed, the Company may not be able to fund its business or its expansion, take advantage
of strategic acquisitions or investment opportunities or respond to competitive pressures. Such inability to obtain additional financing
when needed could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, results of operations, cash flow, financial condition
and prospects. 

If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or
convertible debt securities, we will reduce the percentage ownership of our then-existing stockholders, and the holders of those newly-issued
equity or convertible debt securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those possessed by our then-existing stockholders
and/or note holders. Additionally, future sales of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock or other equity-related securities
could depress the market price of our Common Stock in the public market, and could impair our current or future ability to raise capital
through the sale of additional equity or equity-linked securities or the sale of debt. We cannot predict the effect that future sales
of our Common Stock or other equity-related securities would have on the market price of our Common Stock.
