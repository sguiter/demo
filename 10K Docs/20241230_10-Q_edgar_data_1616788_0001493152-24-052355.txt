and health care research development through its wholly owned subsidiary in Hong Kong. 

(June 30, 2024 - ), and an accumulated deficit of (June 30, 2024 - ).
The Company s continued existence is dependent upon its ability to continue to execute its operating plan and to obtain additional
debt or equity financing. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
There can be no assurance that the necessary debt or equity financing will be available, or will be available on terms acceptable to
the Company, in which case the Company may be unable to meet its obligations. Should the Company be unable to realize its assets and
discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business, the net realizable value of its assets may be materially less than the amounts
recorded in the audited financial statements. The audited financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability
of recorded asset amounts that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in existence.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Forward-Looking
Statements 

This
report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. We use words such as anticipate, believe, plan, expect,
future, intend and similar expressions to identify such forward-looking statements. You should not place too much reliance on these forward-looking
statements. The Company s actual results are likely to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements
for many reasons. 

Plan
of Operation 

Legacy
Ventures International, Inc. Legacy or the Company ), was incorporated on March 4, 2014 under the laws of
the State of Nevada. The Company currently has no ongoing operations except for the incurring of general and administrative expenditures. 

On
December 27, 2023, the Company incorporate Ever Green Living Ventures Ltd, a company incorporated in Hong Kong. The Company owns 100 
of Ever Green Living Ventures Ltd. The Company plans to engage in Biotech research development and health care research development
through its wholly owned subsidiary in Hong Kong. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company s primary source of liquidity consisted of 1,092 (June 30, 2024 - 842) in cash. The Company
financed its operations through a combination of advances from a shareholder and a director. 

The
Company has sustained net losses which have resulted in a total stockholders deficiency at September 30, 2024, and is currently
experiencing a shortfall in operating capital which raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern. The Company anticipates a net loss for the period ending September 30, 2024 and with the expected cash requirements for the
coming months, without additional cash inflows from a corporate transaction, there is substantial doubt as to the Company s ability
to continue operations. 

We
may seek to secure additional debt or equity capital to finance substantial business development initiatives. There is presently no agreement
in place with any source of financing for the Company and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise any additional
funds, or that such funds will be available on acceptable terms. Funds raised through future equity financing will likely be substantially
dilutive to current shareholders. Lack of additional funds will materially affect the Company and its business, and may cause the Company
to cease operations. Consequently, shareholders could incur a loss of their entire investment in the Company. 

Net
Cash Used in Operating Activities 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operations was 13,293 and 9,836 for the three months ended September 30, 2023,
respectively. Cash used in operating activities was primarily the result of net loss from operations and settlement of accrual liabilities. 

Net
Cash Used in Investing Activities 

There
was no cash used in or provided by investing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Net
Cash Provided by Financing Activity 

There
was cash provided by financing activities of 13,543 and 9,000, respectively for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
as a result of the advances from a shareholder. 

10 

Results
of Operations 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024 

Operating
expenses. Operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 20,465 compared with 6,744 for the three months ended
September 30, 2023. Operating expenses were similar in both period which arise from professional fee charged by auditor, valuation surveyor
and consultant. 

Other
expenses. There were other expenses of 6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. There were no other expenses the three months
ended September 30, 2023. Other expenses arise from the bank charges. 

Net
loss. Net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 20,471, compared with net loss of 6,744 for the three months ended
September 30, 2023. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company s
financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or
capital resources that is material to investors. 

Personnel 

The
Company has no full-time employees, but utilizes other project-based contract personnel to carry out the Company s business. We
utilize contract personnel on a continuous basis, primarily in connection with the filing of reports with the Securities and Exchange
Commission which require a high level of specialization for one or more of the service components offered. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

Not
Required. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

The
Securities and Exchange Commission defines the term disclosure controls and procedures to mean a Company s controls
and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files
or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified
in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls
and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive
and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. The Company maintains such a system of controls and procedures in an effort to ensure that all information which it is required
to disclose in the reports it files under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified under the SEC s rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated
to principal executive and principal financial officers to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. 

As
of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
participation of the Company s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b). Based upon this evaluation,
the Company s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures
as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report were ineffective due to a lack of segregation of duties, due to limited
administrative and financial personnel and related resources and as the Company only has one director. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no significant changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period ended
September 30, 2024, that have materially or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal controls over financial
reporting.
