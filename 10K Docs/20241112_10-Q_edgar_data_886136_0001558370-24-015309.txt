In 2012, Congress mandated that the FCC conduct an incentive auction of broadcast television spectrum as set forth in the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 ("Spectrum Act"). The Spectrum Act authorized the FCC to conduct incentive auctions in which licensees could voluntarily relinquish their spectrum usage rights in order to permit the assignment by auction of new initial licenses subject to flexible use service rules, in exchange for a portion of the resulting auction proceeds. The Spectrum Act appropriated 1.75 billion to the TV Broadcaster Relocation Fund ("Reimbursement Fund") for costs reasonably incurred by Full Power and Class A broadcast television licensees reassigned to new channels (the "repack"), as well as Multichannel Video Programming Distributors ("MVPDs") that incurred costs related to continuing to carry the signals of reassigned broadcast stations. The 2018 Reimbursement Expansion Act appropriated 1 billion in additional funds for the Reimbursement Fund and expanded eligible entities for reimbursement to include FM stations affected by the repack. During the first quarter of 2023, we received approximately in reimbursement for our FM stations. This reimbursement was recorded in other (income), expense, net, in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. We do not anticipate receiving any additional reimbursements.

Introduction The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto of Saga Communications, Inc. and its subsidiaries contained elsewhere herein and the audited financial statements and Management s Discussion and Analysis contained in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The following discussion is presented on a consolidated basis. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), which require us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures and contingencies. We evaluate estimates used in preparation of our financial statements on a continual basis. There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies that are described in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. We use certain financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP) to assess our financial performance. For example, we evaluate the performance of our markets based on station operating income (operating income plus corporate general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, other operating (income) expenses, and impairment of intangible assets). Station operating income is generally recognized by the broadcasting industry as a measure of performance, is used by analysts who report on the performance of the broadcasting industry and serves as an indicator of the market value of a group of stations. In addition, we use it to evaluate individual stations, market-level performance, overall operations and as a primary measure for incentive based compensation of executives and other members of management. Station operating income is not necessarily indicative of amounts that may be available to us for debt service requirements, other commitments, reinvestment or other discretionary uses. Station operating income is not a measure of liquidity or of performance in accordance with GAAP, and should be viewed as a supplement to, and not a substitute for our results of operations presented on a GAAP basis.

 Financial Condition and Results of Operations General We are a media company primarily engaged in acquiring, developing and operating broadcast properties including opportunities complimentary to our core radio business including digital, e-commerce and non-traditional revenue initiatives. We actively seek and explore opportunities for expansion through the acquisition of additional broadcast properties. We review acquisition opportunities on an ongoing basis. For additional information with respect to acquisitions, see Liquidity and Capital Resources below. We own or operate broadcast properties in 28 markets, including 82 FM and 32 AM radio stations and 79 metro signals. Radio Stations Our radio stations primary source of revenue is from the sale of advertising for broadcast on our stations. Depending on the format of a particular radio station, there are a predetermined number of advertisements available to be broadcast each hour. Most advertising contracts are short-term and generally run for a few weeks only. The majority of our revenue is generated from local advertising, which is sold primarily by each radio market s sales staff. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately 90 and 89 , respectively, of our radio stations gross revenue was from local advertising. To generate national advertising sales, we engage independent advertising sales representative firms that specialize in national sales for each of our broadcast markets. Our revenue varies throughout the year. Advertising expenditures, our primary source of revenue, generally have been lowest during the winter months, which include the first quarter of each year. Furthermore, we expect political revenue in 2024 to increase from 2023 levels as a result of more elections at the national, state and local levels. Our net operating revenue, station operating expense and operating income varies from market to market based upon each market s rank or size which is based upon population and the available radio advertising revenue in that particular market. The broadcasting industry and advertising in general is influenced by the state of the overall economy, including unemployment rates, inflation, energy prices and consumer interest rates. Our stations primarily broadcast in small to midsize markets. Historically, such markets have been more stable than major metropolitan markets during downturns in advertising spending, but may not experience increases in such spending as significant as those in major metropolitan markets in periods of economic improvement. Our financial results are dependent on a number of factors, the most significant of which is our ability to generate advertising revenue through rates charged to advertisers. The rates a station is able to charge are, in large part, based on a station s ability to attract audiences in the demographic groups targeted by its advertisers. In a number of our markets, this is measured by periodic reports generated by independent national rating services. In the remainder of our markets it is measured by the results advertisers obtain through the actual running of an advertising schedule. Advertisers measure these results based on increased demand for their goods or services and/or actual revenues generated from such demand. Various factors affect the rates a station can charge, including the general strength of the local and national economies, population growth, ability to provide popular programming, local market competition, target marketing capability of radio compared to other advertising media, and signal strength.

Table of Contents 
 When we acquire and/or begin to operate a station or group of stations we generally increase programming and advertising and promotion expenses to increase our share of our target demographic audience. Our strategy sometimes requires levels of spending commensurate with the revenue levels we plan on achieving in two to five years. During periods of economic downturns, or when the level of advertising spending is flat or down across the industry, this strategy may result in the appearance that our cost of operations is increasing at a faster rate than our growth in revenues, until such time as we achieve our targeted levels of revenue for the acquired station or group of stations. The number of advertisements that can be broadcast without jeopardizing listening levels (and the resulting ratings) is limited in part by the format of a particular radio station. Our stations strive to maximize revenue by constantly managing the number of commercials available for sale and adjusting prices based upon local market conditions and ratings. While there may be shifts from time to time in the number of advertisements broadcast during a particular time of day, the total number of advertisements broadcast on a particular station generally does not vary significantly from year to year. Any change in our revenue, with the exception of those instances where stations are acquired or sold, is generally the result of inventory sell-out ratios and pricing adjustments, which are made to ensure that the station efficiently utilizes available inventory. Our radio stations employ a variety of programming formats. We periodically perform market research, including music evaluations, focus groups and strategic vulnerability studies. Because reaching a large and demographically attractive audience is crucial to a station s financial success, we endeavor to develop strong listener loyalty. Our stations also employ audience promotions to further develop and secure a loyal following. We believe that the diversification of formats on our radio stations helps to insulate us from the effects of changes in musical tastes of the public on any particular format. The primary operating expenses involved in owning and operating radio stations are employee salaries and related benefits costs, sales commissions, programming expenses, depreciation, and advertising and promotion expenses. The radio broadcasting industry is subject to rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and the emergence of new media technologies and services. These new technologies and media are gaining advertising share against radio and other traditional media. We are continuing to expand our digital initiative to provide a seamless experience across multiple platforms. Our goal is to allow our listeners to connect with our brands on demand, wherever, however and whenever they choose. We continue to create and expand opportunities through targeted digital advertising, online community news, entertainment and events and an array of digital services that include online promotions, mobile messaging, and email marketing.

We had an increase of approximately 666,000 that was attributable to stations that we did not own or operate for the entire comparable period, offset by a decrease of 1,697,000 generated by stations we owned or operated for the comparable period in 2023 same station ). The decrease in same station revenue was primarily a result of decreases in gross local revenue of 2,635,000 and gross national revenue of 107,000, partially offset by increases in gross political revenue of 442,000, non-spot revenue of 240,000 and gross interactive revenue of 95,000 and a decrease in agency commissions of 226,000, from the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in gross local revenues was attributable to decreases at our Clarksville, Tennessee; Columbus, Ohio; Des Moines, Iowa; Manchester, New Hampshire; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and Norfolk, Virginia markets. The decrease in gross national revenue is primarily due to a decrease at our Norfolk, Virginia market partially offset by an increase at our Columbus, Ohio market. The decrease in agency commissions is due to the decrease in national and local agency revenue. The gross political revenue increased due to an increase in the number of national, state and local elections. The increase in non-spot revenue is due to increases at our Manchester, New Hampshire; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Portland, Maine; and Yankton, South Dakota markets. The increase in gross interactive revenue is primarily due to an increase in our streaming and website advertising revenue. Station operating expense was 23,458,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 22,760,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 698,000 or 3.1 . We had an increase of approximately 775,000 that was attributable to stations that we did not own or operate for the entire comparable period, offset by a decrease of 77,000 generated by stations we owned or operated for the comparable period in 2023. The decrease in same station operating expense was primarily a result of decreases in compensation-related expenses and music licensing expenses of 363,000 and 90,000, respectively, partially offset by increases in bad debt expenses, interactive consulting and content expenses, sales survey expenses and advertising and promotion expenses of 165,000, 115,000, 40,000 and 35,000, respectively, from the third quarter of 2023.

 We had operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 1,645,000 compared to 3,492,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 1,847,000. The decrease in operating income was the result of a decrease in net operating revenue and an increase in station operating expenses noted above, and an increase in corporate general and administrative expenses of 114,000 and an increase in other operating (income) expense, net of 4,000. The increase in corporate general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increases in stock-based compensation, computer software and cyber security expenses and compensation-related expenses of 224,000, 110,000, and 29,000, respectively, partially offset by decreases in insurance related costs and other consulting expenses of 132,000 and 101,000, respectively. We generated net income of 1,267,000 0.20 per share on a fully diluted basis) during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2,729,000 0.45 per share on a fully diluted basis) for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 1,462,000. The decrease in net income is primarily due to the decrease in operating income, described above, an increase in interest expense of 77,000, a decrease in interest income of 136,000, partially offset by an increase in other income of 78,000 and a decrease in income tax expense of 520,000. The increase in interest expense is due to an increase in debt outstanding. The decrease in interest income is related to the decrease in the amount of short-term investment accounts. The increase in other income is due to the gain on insurance claims of 78,000 received as a result of weather-related damages. The gain on insurance claim is recorded in other (income) expense, net in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operation. The decrease in our income tax expense is due to lower income before income tax expense from the third quarter of 2024.

The decrease in gross local revenues was attributable to decreases at our Clarksville, Tennessee; Columbus, Ohio; Des Moines, Iowa; Manchester, New Hampshire; and Milwaukee, Wisconsin markets. The decrease in gross national revenue is primarily due to a decrease at our Norfolk, Virginia market partially offset by increases at our Bellingham, Washington; Columbus, Ohio and Springfield, Illinois markets. The decrease in agency commissions is due to the decrease in national and local agency revenue. The increase in gross interactive revenue is primarily due to an increase in our streaming and website advertising revenue.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources Debt Arrangements and Debt Service Requirements On December 19, 2022, we entered into the Third Amendment to our Credit Facility, (the Third Amendment ), which extended the maturity date to December 19, 2027, reduced the lenders to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and the Huntington National Bank (the Lenders ), established an interest rate equal to the secured overnight financing rate SOFR as administered by the SOFR Administrator (currently established as the Federal Reserve Bank of New York) as the interest base, and increased the basis points. We have pledged substantially all of our assets (excluding our FCC licenses and certain other assets) in support of the Credit Facility and each of our subsidiaries has guaranteed the Credit Facility and has pledged substantially all of their assets (excluding their FCC licenses and certain other assets) in support of the Credit Facility. Approximately 266,000 of debt issuance costs related to the Credit Facility were capitalized and are being amortized over the life of the Credit Facility. These debt issuance costs are included in other assets, net in the consolidated balance sheets. As a result of the Second Amendment to our Credit Facility, the Company incurred an additional 120,000 of transaction fees related to the Credit Facility that were capitalized. As a result of the Third Amendment, the Company incurred an additional 161,000 of transaction fees related to the Credit Facility that were capitalized. The cumulative transaction fees are being amortized over the remaining life of the Credit Facility. Interest rates under the Credit Facility are payable, at our option, at alternatives equal to SOFR (5.16 at September 30, 2024), plus 1 to 2 or the base rate plus 0 to 1 . The spread over SOFR and the base rate vary from time to time, depending upon our financial leverage. Letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility will be subject to a participation fee (which is equal to the interest rate applicable to Eurocurrency Loans, as defined in the Credit Agreement) payable to each of the Lenders and a fronting fee equal to 0.25 per annum payable to the issuing bank. Under the Third Amendment, we now pay quarterly commitment fees of 0.25 per annum on the unused portion of the Credit Facility. We previously paid quarterly commitment fees of 0.2 to 0.3 per annum on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility. The Credit Facility contains a number of financial covenants (all of which we were in compliance with at September 30, 2024) which, among other things, require us to maintain specified financial ratios and impose certain limitations on us with respect to investments, additional indebtedness, dividends, distributions, guarantees, liens and encumbrances. We had 5,000,000 debt outstanding at September 30, 2024 that we borrowed in conjunction with our Lafayette acquisition and no debt outstanding at December 31, 2023. We had approximately 45 million and 50 million of unused borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Sources and Uses of Cash During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had net cash flows from operating activities of 10,141,000 and 13,921,000, respectively. We believe that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet quarterly debt service requirements for payments of interest and principal under our Credit Facility if we borrow in the future. However, if such cash flow is not sufficient we may be required to sell additional equity securities, refinance our obligations or dispose of one or more of our properties in order to make such scheduled payments. There can be no assurance that we would be able to effect any such transactions on favorable terms, if at all. In March 2013, our board of directors authorized an increase to our Stock Buy-Back Program (the Buy-Back Program to allow us to purchase up to 75.8 million of our Class A Common Stock. From its inception in 1998 through September 30, 2024, we have repurchased 2.2 million shares of our Class A Common Stock for 57.8 million. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, 715 shares were retained for the payment of withholding taxes for 11,000 related to the vesting of restricted stock. We halted the directions issued for any additional buybacks under our plan in 2020. We continue to monitor economic conditions to determine if and when it makes sense to make additional buybacks under our plan.

 Our capital expenditures, exclusive of acquisitions, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 3,199,000 3,397,000 in 2023). We anticipate capital expenditures in 2024 to be approximately 4.0 million to 4.5 million, which we expect to finance through funds generated from operations. On February 13, 2024, we entered into an agreement to purchase the assets of WKOA (FM), WKHY (FM), WASK (FM), WXXB (FM), WASK (AM) and W269DJ from Neuhoff Communications, Inc. serving the Greater Lafayette, Indiana radio market for 5.3 million, subject to certain purchase price adjustments. The Company closed on this transaction on May 31, 2024, using funds from operations and borrowings under our credit agreement, of 5,832,000, which included the purchase price of 5,300,000, the purchase of 499,000 in accounts receivable and transactional costs of approximately 121,000 offset by 88,000 in certain closing adjustments.. During 2024, the Company s Board of Directors has declared three quarterly cash dividends and a variable dividend on its Class A Common Stock. These dividends totaling 1.35 per share and approximately 8.5 million were paid or accrued as of September 30, 2024. During 2023, the Company s Board of Directors declared four quarterly cash dividends and one special dividend on its Class A Common Stock. These dividends totaling 3.00 per share and approximately 18.6 million were accrued or paid during 2023. We continue to actively seek and explore opportunities for expansion through the acquisitions of additional broadcast properties. We anticipate that any future acquisitions of radio stations and dividend payments will be financed through funds generated from operations, borrowings under the Credit Agreement, additional debt or equity financing, cash on hand, or a combination thereof. However, there can be no assurances that any such financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Summary Disclosures About Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments We have future cash obligations under various types of contracts, including the terms of our Credit Facility, operating leases, programming contracts, employment agreements, and other operating contracts. For additional information concerning our future cash obligations see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation Summary Disclosures About Contractual Obligations in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. We anticipate that our contractual cash obligations will be financed through funds generated from operations or additional borrowings under the Credit Facility, or a combination thereof. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recent accounting pronouncements are described in Note 2 to the accompanying financial statements. Inflation The impact of inflation on our operations has not been significant to date. We are, however, starting to see the effects of higher inflation starting to impact costs of most goods and services. There can be no assurance that a high rate of inflation in the future would not have an adverse effect on our operations.
