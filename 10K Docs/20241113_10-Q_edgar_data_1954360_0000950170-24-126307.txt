CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This report contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors and undue reliance should not be placed thereon. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about Crescent Private Credit Income Corp (together, with its consolidated subsidiaries, the Company," we or our ), our current and prospective portfolio investments, our industry, our beliefs and opinions, and our assumptions. Words such as anticipates, expects, intends, plans, will, may, continue, believes, seeks, estimates, would, could, should, targets, projects, outlook, potential, predicts and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements, including without limitation: 
 the ability of our investment adviser to locate suitable investments for us and to monitor and administer our investments; 

regulations governing our operation as a business development company; 

financing investments with borrowed money; 

operation in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities; 

risks associated with original issue discount OID and payment-in-kind PIK interest income; 

changes in interest rates may affect our cost of capital and net investment income; 

the impact of changes in Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ), or other benchmark rates on our operating results; 

uncertainty as to the value of certain portfolio investments; 

our ability to deploy any capital raised in sales of our Common Shares; 

lack of liquidity in investments; 

the impact of changes in laws or regulations (including the interpretation thereof), including tax laws, governing our operations or the operations of our portfolio companies; 

political and regulatory conditions that contribute to uncertainty and market volatility, including the recent U.S. presidential election and legislative, regulatory, trade and policies associated with a new administration; 

the conflict in the Middle East; 

the timing, form and amount of any dividend distributions; 

risks regarding distributions; 

potential resignation of the Adviser and/or the Administrator; 

potential adverse effects of price declines and illiquidity in the corporate debt markets; 

potential impact of economic recessions or downturns; 

defaults by portfolio companies; 

the outcome and impact of any litigation; 

uncertainty surrounding the financial stability of the United States, Europe and China; 

adverse developments in the credit markets; and 

potential fluctuation in quarterly operating results. 

Although we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based upon are reasonable, some of those assumptions may be based on the work of third parties and any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate; as a result, forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could prove to be inaccurate. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the Quarterly Report should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this Quarterly Report or other information incorporated herein by reference, as applicable. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements or any other information contained herein, except as required by applicable law. You are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to you or through reports that we in the future may file with the SEC, including registration statements on Form N-2, annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. The safe harbor provisions of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ), which preclude civil liability for certain forward-looking statements, do not apply to the forward-looking statements in this report because we are an investment company.

Base Management Fee The management fee is payable monthly in arrears at an annual rate of of the value of the Company's net assets as of the beginning of the first calendar day of the applicable month. For purposes of calculating the management fee under the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement, net assets means the Company's total net assets, determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP, and appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current calendar month. For example, assuming there were 30 days in a calendar month, if we sold shares on the first day of the month, our net asset value for such month would give effect to the net proceeds of the issuance for the 30 days of the month during which the additional shares were outstanding. If we repurchased shares on the 25th day of the month, our net asset value for such month would give effect to the repurchase for the five days of the month during which such shares were no longer outstanding. For the first calendar month in which the Company had operations, May 2023, net assets were measured as the beginning net assets as of the effective date of the initial Investment Advisory and Management Agreement. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred management fees of and , of which and , respectively, were voluntarily waived by the Adviser.

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and management fees, respectively, were unpaid. Incentive Fee per Investment Advisory and Management Agreement Under the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement, the incentive fee consists of two parts: The first part, the income incentive fee, is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears and is paid with respect to the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income (as defined below) in each calendar quarter as follows: (a) no incentive fee based on pre-incentive fee net investment income in any calendar quarter in which the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed a hurdle rate of per quarter annualized) (the Hurdle ), (b) of the dollar amount of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the Hurdle rate but is less than a rate of return of annualized), and (c) of the dollar amount of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds a rate of return of annualized). The second part, the capital gains incentive fee, is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year at a rate of of the Company s realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from the Company s commencement of operations through the end of such calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees. In the event that the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement shall terminate as of a date that is not a calendar year end, the termination date shall be treated as though it were a calendar year end for purposes of calculating and paying a capital gains incentive fee. Pre-incentive fee net investment income means, as the context requires, either the dollar value of, or percentage rate of return on the value of the Company s net assets in accordance with GAAP at the end of the immediately preceding quarter from, interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Company receives from portfolio companies) accrued during each calendar quarter, minus the Company s operating expenses accrued for such quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement entered into between us and the Administrator and any interest expense or fees on any credit facilities or outstanding debt and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee and any stockholder and/or distribution servicing fees).

and , respectively, all of which were voluntarily waived by the Adviser. For the three months ended September 30, 2023 and for the period from May 5, 2023 (commencement of operations) through September 30, 2023, the Company incurred income incentive fees of and , respectively, all of which were voluntarily waived by the Adviser . As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, income incentive fees were unpaid. GAAP Incentive Fee on Cumulative Unrealized Capital Appreciation The Company accrues, but does not pay, a portion of the incentive fee based on capital gains with respect to net unrealized appreciation. Under GAAP, the Company is required to accrue an incentive fee based on capital gains that includes net realized capital gains and losses and net unrealized capital appreciation and depreciation on investments held at the end of each period. In calculating the accrual for the incentive fee based on capital gains, the Company considers the cumulative aggregate unrealized capital appreciation in the calculation, since an incentive fee based on capital gains would be payable if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the fee payable under the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement. of such amount, minus the aggregate amount of actual incentive fees based on capital gains paid in all prior periods. If such amount is negative, then there is no accrual for such period. There can be no assurance that such unrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company (reversed) recorded GAAP incentive fees of and , respectively. Because the Adviser has agreed to voluntarily waive all incentive fees through September 30, 2024, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded (reversed) a corresponding waiver of GAAP incentive fees of and , respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2023 and for the period from May 5, 2023 (commencement of operations) through September 30, 2023, the Company recorded GAAP incentive fees of and , respectively. Because the Adviser has agreed to voluntarily waive all incentive fees through September 30, 2024 , for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and for the period from May 5, 2023 (commencement of operations) through September 30, 2023, the Company recorded a corresponding waiver of GAAP incentive fees of and ), respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, GAAP incentive fees remain outstanding. Intermediary Manager Agreement On July 17, 2023, the Company entered into an Intermediary Manager agreement (the Intermediary Manager Agreement with Emerson Equity LLC (the Intermediary Manager ). Under the terms of the Intermediary Manager Agreement, the Intermediary Manager agreed to, among other things, manage the Company's relationships with third-party brokers engaged by the Intermediary Manager to participate in the distribution of common shares and financial advisors. The Intermediary Manager will be entitled to receive stockholder servicing and/or distribution fees monthly in arrears at an annual rate of of the Company s aggregate NAV attributable to Class S shares as of the beginning of the first calendar day of the month. The Intermediary Manager is entitled to receive stockholder servicing and/or distribution fees monthly in arrears at an annual rate of of the Company s aggregate NAV attributable to Class D shares as of the beginning of the first calendar day of the month. stockholder servicing and/or distribution fees will be paid with respect to Class I shares. The stockholder servicing and/or distribution fees will be payable to the Intermediary Manager, but the Intermediary Manager anticipates that all or a portion of the stockholder servicing and/or distribution fees will be retained by, or re-allowed (paid) to, participating broker-dealers. The Company will cease paying the stockholder servicing and/or distribution fees on the Class S shares and Class D shares on the earlier to occur of the following: (i) a listing of Class I shares, (ii) a merger or consolidation with or into another entity, or the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Company s assets or (iii) the date following the completion of the primary portion of the Offering on which, in the aggregate, underwriting compensation from all sources in connection with the Offering, including the

of the gross proceeds from the Offering. In addition, at the end of the month in which the Intermediary Manager in conjunction with the transfer agent determines that total transaction or other fees, including upfront placement fees or brokerage commissions, and stockholder servicing and/or distribution fees paid with respect to any single share held in a stockholder s account would exceed, in the aggregate, of the gross proceeds from the sale of such Common Shares (or a lower limit as determined by the Intermediary Manager or the applicable selling agent), the Company will cease paying the stockholder servicing and/or distribution fee on either (i) each such share that would exceed such limit or (ii) all Class S shares and Class D shares in such stockholder s account. At the end of such month, the applicable Class S shares or Class D shares in such common stockholder s account will convert into a number of Class I shares (including any fractional shares), with an equivalent aggregate NAV as such Class S shares or Class D shares. The Intermediary Manager is a broker-dealer registered with the SEC and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The Intermediary Manager Agreement may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, by vote of a majority of the Company s board of directors who are not interested persons , as defined in the Investment Company Act, of the Company and who have no direct or indirect financial interest in the operation of the Company s distribution plan or the Intermediary Manager Agreement or by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Company, on not more than 60 days written notice to the Intermediary Manager. The Intermediary Manager may terminate the Intermediary Manager Agreement, without the payment of penalty, on at least 120 days' written notice to the Company. Either party may terminate the Intermediary Manager Agreement immediately upon notice to the other party in the event that such other party shall have failed to comply with any material provision of the Intermediary Manager Agreement. The Intermediary Manager Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of its assignment, as defined in the Investment Company Act. The Company s obligations under the Intermediary Manager Agreement to pay the stockholder servicing and/or distribution fees with respect to the Class S shares and Class D shares distributed shall survive termination of the agreement until such shares are no longer outstanding (including such shares that have been converted into Class I shares, as described above). Distribution and Servicing Plan On May 4, 2023, the Board approved a distribution and servicing plan (the Distribution and Servicing Plan ). 

Class D Shares 

Class I Shares

The stockholder servicing and/or distribution fees are paid monthly in arrears, calculated using the NAV of the applicable class as of the beginning of the first calendar day of the month and subject to FINRA and other limitations on underwriting compensation. The Intermediary Manager will reallow (pay) all or a portion of the stockholder servicing and/or distribution fees to participating brokers and servicing brokers for ongoing stockholder services performed by such brokers, and will waive stockholder servicing and/or distribution fees to the extent a broker is not eligible to receive it for failure to provide such services. Because the stockholder servicing and/or distribution fees with respect to Class S shares or Class D shares are calculated based on the aggregate NAV for all of the outstanding shares of each such class, it reduces the NAV with respect to all shares of each such class, including shares issued under the Company s distribution reinvestment plan. Eligibility to receive the stockholder servicing and/or distribution fee is conditioned on a broker providing the following ongoing services with respect to the Class S shares or Class D shares: assistance with recordkeeping, answering investor inquiries regarding the Company, including regarding distribution payments and reinvestments, helping investors understand their investments upon their request, and assistance with share repurchase requests. If the applicable broker is not eligible to receive the stockholder servicing and/or distribution fee due to failure to provide these services, the Intermediary Manager will waive the stockholder servicing and/or distribution fee that broker would have otherwise been eligible to receive. The stockholder servicing and/or distribution fees are ongoing fees that are not paid at the time of purchase. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company has not incurred any expenses in connection with the Intermediary Manager Agreement. Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement The Company has entered into an Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement on May 3, 2023 (the Expense Support Agreement with the Adviser. The Adviser may elect to pay certain expenses of the Company on the Company s behalf (each, an Expense Payment ), provided that no portion of an Expense Payment will be used to pay any interest expense or

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s debt and equity securities are primarily earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA comparable multiples and market discount rates. The Company typically uses comparable EBITDA multiples on its equity securities to determine the fair value of investments. The Company uses discount rates for debt securities to determine if the effective yield on a debt security is commensurate with the market yields for that type of debt security. The significant unobservable inputs used in the discounted cash flow approach is the discount rate used to discount the estimated future cash flows expected to be received from the underlying investment, which include both future principal and interest payments. Increases and decreases in the discount rate would result in a decrease and increase in the fair value, respectively. Included in the consideration and selection of discount rates is risk of default, rating of the investment, call provisions and comparable company investments. 

 The significant unobservable inputs used in the market multiple approach are the multiples of similar companies EBITDA, revenue and comparable market transactions. Increases and decreases in market EBITDA multiples and revenue would result in an increase or decrease in the fair value, respectively.

 Distribution Reinvestment Plan The Company has adopted a distribution reinvestment plan pursuant to which stockholders will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of the Company's same class of common stock to which the distribution relates unless they elect to receive their distributions in cash. As a result, if the Board authorizes, and the Company declares, a cash dividend or other distribution, then stockholders who have not opted out of the Company s distribution reinvestment plan (or, in the case of Alabama, Arkansas, California, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Vermont and Washington stockholders and clients of participating brokers that do not permit automatic enrollment in our distribution reinvestment plan, opted to participate in such plan), will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares, rather than receiving the cash dividend or other distribution. Distributions on fractional shares will be credited to each participating stockholder s account to three decimal places. Share Repurchase Program At the discretion of the Board and beginning no later than the first full calendar quarter from the date on which the Company commences the Offering, the Company intends to commence a share repurchase program in which the Company intends to offer to repurchase, in each quarter, up to of its Common Shares outstanding (either by number of shares or aggregate NAV) in each quarter. The Board may amend, suspend, or terminate the share repurchase program if it deems such action to be in the best interest of the Company and its common stockholders. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each quarter, or at all. The Company will conduct such repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Investment Company Act, with terms of such tender offer published in a tender offer statement to be sent to all stockholders and filed with the SEC on Schedule TO. All shares purchased by the Company pursuant to the terms of each tender offer will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued shares.

The Early Repurchase Deduction will be retained by the Company for the benefit of remaining common stockholders.

CCAP Administration LLC also serves as the Administrator of Crescent Capital BDC, Inc. CCAP ), a publicly-traded BDC affiliated with the Company, since 2015. 
 Our investment objectives are to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation through debt and related equity investments. We seek to invest primarily in directly originated assets, including first lien senior secured loans (including unitranche loans, which are loans that combine both senior and subordinated debt, generally in a first lien position), second lien senior secured loans, subordinated secured and unsecured loans, subordinated debt, which in some cases includes an equity component and preferred component and other types of credit instruments, made to or issued by U.S. middle-market companies. Our primary focus is to invest in companies with EBITDA of 35 million to 120 million; however, we may invest in larger or smaller companies. The first and second lien senior secured loans generally have terms of five to eight years. In connection with our first and second lien senior secured loans, we generally receive security interests in certain assets of our portfolio companies that could serve as collateral in support of the repayment of such loans. First and second lien senior secured loans generally have floating interest rates, which may have interest rate floors, and also may provide for some amortization of principal and excess cash flow payments, with the remaining principal balance due at maturity. To a lesser extent, we may make investments in syndicated loans and other liquid credit investment opportunities, including in publicly traded debt instruments, for cash management purposes, while also presenting an opportunity for attractive investment returns. The credit instruments we may invest in include distressed securities, securitized products, notes, bills, debentures, bank loans, convertible and preferred securities and government and municipal obligations. We may also invest in foreign instruments and illiquid and restricted securities. 
 Under normal circumstances, we will invest at least 80 of our total assets (net assets plus borrowings for investment purposes) in private credit investments (loans, bonds and other credit instruments that are issued in private offerings or issued by private companies). While most of our investments will be in private U.S. companies, we also expect to invest from time to time in non-U.S. companies (we generally have to invest at least 70 of our total assets in qualifying assets, including private U.S. companies). We believe that our liquid credit investments will help maintain liquidity to satisfy any share repurchases we choose to make in our sole discretion and manage cash before investing subscription proceeds into directly originated loans while also seeking attractive investment returns. We expect these investments to enhance our risk/return profile and serve as a source of liquidity for the Company. Subject to the limitations of the Investment Company Act, we may invest in loans or other securities, the proceeds of which may refinance or otherwise repay debt or securities of companies whose debt is owned by other Crescent funds. From time to time, we may co-invest with other Crescent funds. 
 First lien investments are senior loans that have the benefit of a first-priority security interest on all existing and future assets of the issuer. The security interest ranks above the security interest of any second-lien lenders in those assets. 
 Unitranche investments are loans that may extend deeper in a company s capital structure than traditional first lien debt and may provide for a waterfall of cash flow priority among different lenders in the unitranche loan. In certain instances, we may find another lender to provide the first out portion of such loan and retain the last out portion of such loan, in which case, the first out portion of the loan would generally receive priority with respect to payment of principal, interest and any other amounts due thereunder over the last out portion that we would continue to hold. In exchange for the greater risk of loss, the last out portion earns a higher interest rate. 
 40 

Second lien investments are loans with a second priority lien on all existing and future assets of the portfolio company. The security interest ranks below the security interests of any first lien and unitranche lenders in those assets. 
 Unsecured debt investments are loans that generally rank senior to a borrower s equity securities and junior in right of payment to such borrower s other senior indebtedness. 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ materially. The critical accounting policies and estimates should be read in connection with our risk factors as disclosed herein. 
 For a description of our critical accounting policies and estimates, see Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements. We consider the most significant accounting policies to be those related to our Valuation of Portfolio Investments, Revenue Recognition, Non-Accrual Investments, Distribution Policy, and Income Taxes. 
 COMPONENTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Investments 
 We expect our investment activity to vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, the general economic environment, the amount of capital we have available to us, the level of merger and acquisition activity for middle-market companies, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to such companies and the competitive environment for the type of investments we make. In addition, as part of our risk strategy on investments, we may reduce certain levels of investments through partial sales or syndication to additional investors. 
 We may not invest in any assets other than qualifying assets specified in the Investment Company Act, unless, at the time the investments are made, at least 70 of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). Qualifying assets include investments in eligible portfolio companies. Pursuant to rules adopted by the SEC, eligible portfolio companies include certain companies that do not have any securities listed on a national securities exchange and public companies whose securities are listed on a national securities exchange but whose market capitalization is less than 250 million. 
 The Investment Adviser 
 Our investment activities are managed by the Adviser, which is responsible for originating prospective investments, conducting research and due diligence investigations on potential investments, analyzing investment opportunities, negotiating and structuring our investments and monitoring our investments and portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. Crescent is majority owned by Sun Life Financial Inc. (together with its subsidiaries and joint ventures, Sun Life ). 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenue primarily in the form of interest income on debt investments and capital gains and distributions, if any, on equity securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies. 
 Certain investments may have contractual PIK interest or dividends. PIK represents accrued interest or accumulated dividends that are added to the loan principal or cost basis of the investment on the respective interest or dividend payment dates rather than being paid in cash and generally becomes due at maturity or upon being called by the issuer. PIK is recorded as interest or dividend income, as applicable. If at any point we believe PIK is not expected to be realized, the investment generating PIK will be placed on non-accrual status. Accrued PIK interest or dividends are generally reversed through interest or dividend income, respectively, when an investment is placed on non-accrual status. We also generate revenue in the form of commitment or origination fees. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts into income over the life of the loan using the effective yield method. 
 Dividend income from common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly-traded portfolio companies. Dividend income from preferred equity securities is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. 
 We may receive other income, which may include income such as consent, waiver, amendment, underwriting, and arranger fees associated with our investment activities as well as any fees for managerial assistance services rendered to the portfolio companies. Such fees are recognized as income when earned or the services are rendered. 
 41 

Expenses 
 Except as specifically provided below, all investment professionals of the Adviser and their respective staff, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory services to us, and the base compensation, bonus and benefits, and the routine overhead expenses, of such personnel allocable to such services, will be provided and paid for by the Adviser. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations, administration and transactions, including, but not limited to: 
 investment advisory fees, including management fees and incentive fees, to the Adviser, pursuant to the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement; 

our allocable portion of the costs, expenses and benefits paid by the Administrator or its affiliates to our chief compliance officer, chief financial officer, general counsel and secretary, their respective staffs and our operations and finance staffs who provide services to us; provided that such reimbursement does not conflict with section 7.8 of our charter; 

the cost of calculating our net asset value; 

fidelity bond, directors and officers liability insurance and other insurance premiums; 

fees and expenses associated with independent audits and outside legal costs; 

independent directors fees and expenses; 

U.S. federal, state and local taxes; 

costs associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the Investment Company Act and other applicable U.S. federal and state securities laws; 

debt service and other costs of borrowings or other financing arrangements; and 

all other expenses reasonably incurred by us in operating the business. 

The Adviser has agreed to advance all of our organization and offering expenses on our behalf until the commencement of the Offering (as defined below). Subsequent to the commencement of the Offering, any such expenses incurred by the Company, including the reimbursements to the Adviser, will be expensed as incurred subject to the Expense Support Agreement. We are obligated to reimburse the Adviser for such advanced expenses (including any additional expenses the Adviser elects to pays on our behalf), subject to certain conditions. See Components of Operations Expenses Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement. Any reimbursements will not exceed actual expenses incurred by the Adviser and its affiliates. 
 From time to time, the Adviser, the Administrator, or their respective affiliates, may pay third party providers of goods or services. We will reimburse the Adviser, the Administrator, or such affiliates thereof for any such amounts paid on our behalf. Each of the Adviser or the Administrator will waive its right to be reimbursed in the event that such reimbursements would cause any distributions to our common stockholders to constitute a return of capital to stockholders. All of these expenses will ultimately be borne by the Company s common stockholders. 
 Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement 
 We have entered into the Expense Support Agreement with the Adviser. For additional information see Note 3 Agreements and Related Party Transactions to the consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Leverage 
 In accordance with applicable SEC staff guidance and interpretations, we, as a BDC, are permitted to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage ratio is at least 150 after such borrowing (if certain requirements are met). Short-term credits necessary for the settlement of securities transactions and arrangements with respect to securities lending will not be considered borrowings for these purposes. The amount of leverage that we may employ depends on our Adviser s and our Board s assessment of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing.

Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid current and, in management s judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no investments on non-accrual status. 
 The Adviser monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. The Adviser monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if it is meeting its business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action for each company. The Adviser has a number of methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include the following: 
 assessment of success of the portfolio company in adhering to its business plan and compliance with covenants; 

review of monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies; 

contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; 

comparisons to other companies in the industry; and 

attendance and participation in board meetings. 

43 

As part of the monitoring process, the Adviser regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our investments and, on a quarterly basis, grades each investment on a risk scale of 1 to 5. Risk assessment is not standardized in our industry and our risk assessment may not be comparable to ones used by our competitors. Our assessment is based on the following categories: 
 (1) Involves the least amount of risk relative to cost or amortized cost. Investment performance is above expectations since origination or acquisition. Trends and risk factors are generally favorable, which may include financial performance or a potential exit. 

(2) Involves a level of risk that is similar to the risk at the time of origination or acquisition. The investment is generally performing as expected, and the risks around our ability to ultimately recoup the cost of the investment are neutral to favorable relative to the time of origination or acquisition. New investments are generally assigned a rating of 2 at origination or acquisition. 

(3) Indicates an investment performing below expectations where the risks around our ability to ultimately recoup the cost of the investment have increased since origination or acquisition. For debt investments, borrowers are more likely than not in compliance with debt covenants and loan payments are generally not past due. An investment rating of 3 requires closer monitoring. 

(4) Indicates an investment performing materially below expectations where the risks around our ability to ultimately recoup the cost of the investment have increased materially since origination or acquisition. For debt investments, borrowers may be out of compliance with debt covenants and loan payments may be past due (but generally not more than 180 days past due). Non-accrual status is strongly considered for debt investments rated 4. 

(5) Indicates an investment performing substantially below expectations where the risks around our ability to ultimately recoup the cost of the investment have substantially increased since origination or acquisition. We do not expect to recover our initial cost basis from investments rated 5. Debt investments with an investment rating of 5 are generally in payment and/or covenant default and are on non-accrual status. 

The following table shows the composition of our portfolio on the 1 to 5 investment performance rating scale. Investment performance ratings are accurate only as of those dates and may change due to subsequent developments relating to a portfolio company s business or financial condition, market conditions or developments, and other factors.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, total net expenses, including the impact of the fee waivers and expense support, were 2.7 million and 6.7 million, respectively. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2023 and for the period from May 5, 2023 (commencement of operations) through September 30, 2023, total expenses, including the impact of the fee waivers and expense support, were 0.5 million and 0.8 million, respectively. We expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or decline as a percentage of total assets during periods of asset growth and to increase during periods of asset declines. 
 Net investment income 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, net investment income was 4.5 million and 10.0 million, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2023 and for the period from May 5, 2023 (commencement of operations) through September 30, 2023, net investment income was 0.9 million. Net investment income can vary substantially from period to period due to various factors including net deployment, credit facility usage and market base rates. 
 Net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investments 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded net realized and unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments of (0.2) million and 0.2 million, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2023 and for the period 
 45 

from May 5, 2023 (commencement of operations) through September 30, 2023, we recorded net unrealized gains on investments of 0.3 million and 0.4 million, respectively. The change in net unrealized gains on investments is primarily driven by the performance of our liquid credit investments. 
 FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 The primary uses of our cash and cash equivalents are for (1) investments in portfolio companies and other investments; (2) the cost of operations (including paying the Adviser and expense reimbursements paid to the Administrator); (3) debt service, repayment, and other financing costs; and (4) future cash distributions to the holders of our common stock. We expect to generate additional liquidity from (1) future offerings of securities, (2) future borrowings and (3) cash flows from operations, including investment sales and repayments as well as income earned on investments. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 14.3 million and 28.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and 48.7 million and 127.5 million of undrawn capacity on our JPM Funding Facility (as defined below) respectively, subject to borrowing base and other limitations. As of September 30, 2024, the undrawn capacity under our facilities and cash and cash equivalents were in excess of our unfunded commitments. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with our asset coverage requirements under the Investment Company Act. In addition, we were in compliance with all the financial covenant requirements of our JPM Funding Facility as of September 30, 2024. However, an increase in realized losses or unrealized depreciation of our investment portfolio or significant reductions in our net asset value as a result of the effects of the rising rate environment and the potential for a recession increase the risk of breaching the relevant covenants requirements. Any breach of these requirements may adversely affect the access to sufficient debt and equity capital.

 The combined weighted average interest rate of the aggregate borrowings outstanding for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 9.33 . The weighted average debt of the borrowings outstanding for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 61.2 million. 
 JPM Funding Facility 
 On December 8, 2023, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (as amended, the JPM Funding Facility ), as servicer, with CPCI Funding SPV, LLC ("CPCI SPV"), our wholly owned subsidiary (the Borrower ), as borrower, the lenders party thereto, U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as collateral agent and collateral administrator, U.S. Bank National Association, as securities intermediary, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, that provides a secured credit facility of 150.0 million with a reinvestment period ending December 8, 2026 and a final maturity date of December 8, 2028. The JPM Funding Facility also provides for a feature that allows the Borrower, under certain circumstances, to increase the overall size of the JPM Funding Facility to a maximum of 500.0 million. In addition, on December 8, 2023, we, as seller, and the Borrower, as purchaser, entered into a Sale and Contribution Agreement, pursuant to which we will sell or contribute to the Borrower certain originated or acquired loans and other corporate debt securities and related assets from time to time. We consolidate CPCI SPV in our consolidated financial statements and no gain or loss is recognized from the transfer of assets to and from CPCI SPV. 
 The obligations of the Borrower under the JPM Funding Facility are secured by substantially all assets held by the Borrower. Since August 23, 2024, the interest rate charged on the JPM Funding Facility is based on an applicable benchmark (Term SOFR or other applicable benchmark based on the currency of the borrowing) plus a margin of 2.25 , subject to increase from time to time pursuant to the terms of the JPM Funding Facility. Prior to August 23, 2024, the interest rate charged on the JPM Funding Facility was based on an applicable benchmark (Term SOFR or other applicable benchmark based on the currency of the borrowing) plus a margin of 2.60 . In addition, the Borrower will pay, among other fees, an administrative agency fee on the facility commitment and a commitment fee on the undrawn balance. The JPM Funding Facility includes customary covenants, including certain limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens, as well as usual and customary events of default for revolving credit facilities of this nature.

To the extent we determine that additional capital would allow us to take advantage of additional investment opportunities, if the market for debt financing presents attractively priced opportunities, or if our Board otherwise determines that leveraging our portfolio would be in our best interest and the best interests of our stockholders, we may enter into new debt financing opportunities in addition to our existing debt. The pricing and other terms of any such opportunities would depend upon market conditions and the performance of our business, among other factors. 
 In accordance with applicable SEC staff guidance and interpretations, with the stockholder approval, we, as a BDC, are now permitted to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage ratio is at least 150 after such borrowing (if certain requirements are met), rather than 200 , as previously required. Short-term credits necessary for the settlement of securities transactions and arrangements with respect to securities lending will not be considered borrowings for these purposes. The amount of leverage that we employ depends on our Adviser s and our Board s assessment of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our asset coverage ratio was 264 and 557 , respectively. We may also refinance or repay any of our indebtedness at any time based on our financial condition and market conditions. See Note 6. Debt to our consolidated financial statements for more detail on the JPM Funding Facility. 
 Capital Share Activity 
 We have authorized three classes of common stock, par value 0.01 per share, Class S Common Stock Class S shares ), Class D Common Stock Class D shares and Class I Common Stock Class I shares and together, with Class S shares and Class D shares, Common Shares ). Pursuant to a subscription agreement entered into between us and Crescent, Crescent purchased 1,000 Class I shares at an initial offering price of 25.00 per share. 
 Additionally, we have agreed to sell Class I shares to Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada, BK Canada Holdings Inc. and Scotia Private Credit Pool (the Private Placement Investors ). The offer and sale of the Class I shares in such transactions (each, a Private Placement were exempt from the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) thereof and/or Regulation S promulgated thereunder. 
 The Private Placement Investors' subscriptions were initially drawn down at a price of 25.00 per share, and subsequent subscriptions were priced at our current NAV at the time of contribution. Since our commencement of operations, we received 153.2 million of committed capital from the Private Placements, and in exchange therefore, we issued approximately 5,996,083 Class I shares to four stockholders, including the investment from our sole initial stockholder. 
 On August 1, 2024, the Company held the first closing in its public offering on a continuous basis of up to 2.5 billion in Common Shares, including Class I shares, Class S shares and Class D shares, pursuant to its Registration Statement on Form N-2 (File No. 333-268622) that was declared effective by the SEC on September 29, 2023 (the Offering ). As of September 30, 2024, we have not offered or sold any of our Class S shares or Class D shares. 
 
 The following table lists the Common Shares issued and total consideration for both the Offering and the Private Placements as of the date of this filing , including approximately 326,214 and 2,292,549 Class I shares, respectively that were issued during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 in exchange for 8.8 million and 60.6 million, respectively .

 Capital Share Distributions 
 We declared in June 2024 and paid in July 2024 our first distribution and we expect to continue to pay regular monthly distributions. Any distributions we make will be at the sole discretion of our Board, which will consider factors such as our earnings, cash flow, capital needs and general financial condition and the requirements of Maryland law. As a result, our distribution rates and payment frequency may vary from time to time. 
 Our Board's discretion as to the payment of distributions will be directed, in substantial part, by its determination to cause us to comply with the RIC (as defined below) requirements. To maintain our treatment as a RIC, we generally are required to make aggregate annual distributions to our common stockholders of at least 90 of our taxable income and tax exempt interest. 
 We declared monthly regular and special distributions for our Class I shares. The following table presents the monthly regular and special distributions that were declared and payable during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We made no distributions for the period from May 5, 2023 (commencement of operations) through September 30, 2023.

 Distribution Reinvestment Plan 
 
 	We have adopted a distribution reinvestment plan pursuant to which stockholders will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of the Company's same class of common stock to which the distribution relates unless they elect to receive their distributions in cash. As a result, if the Board authorizes, and we declare, a cash dividend or other distribution, then stockholders who have not opted out of our distribution reinvestment plan (or, in the case of Alabama, Arkansas, California, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Vermont and Washington stockholders and clients of participating brokers that do not permit automatic enrollment in our distribution reinvestment plan, opted to participate in such plan), will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares, rather than receiving the cash dividend or other distribution. Distributions on fractional shares will be credited to each participating stockholder s account to three decimal places. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 Beginning no later than the first full calendar quarter after we hold the first closing in the Offering, and at the discretion of our Board, we intend to commence a share repurchase program in which we intend to repurchase up to 5 of our Common Shares outstanding (either by number of shares or aggregate NAV) in each quarter. Our Board may amend, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time if it deems such action to be in our best interests. For example, in accordance with our directors' duties to the Company, our Board may amend, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program during periods of market dislocation where selling assets to fund a repurchase could have a materially negative impact on remaining stockholders. As a result, share 
 48 

repurchases may not be available each quarter, such as when a repurchase offer would place an undue burden on our liquidity, adversely affect our operations or risk having an adverse impact on the Company that would outweigh the benefit of the repurchase offer. Following any such suspension, the Board will reinstate the share repurchase program when appropriate and subject to our directors duties to the Company. We intend to conduct such repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4 promulgated under the Exchange Act and the Investment Company Act, with the terms of such tender offer published in a tender offer statement to be sent to all stockholders and filed on Schedule TO. All shares purchased by us pursuant to the terms of each tender offer will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued shares. 
 Under our share repurchase program, to the extent we offer to repurchase shares in any particular quarter, we expect to repurchase shares pursuant to tender offers using a purchase price equal to the NAV per share as of the last calendar day of the applicable month designated by our Board, except that the Company deducts 2.00 from such NAV for shares that have not been outstanding for at least one year, also referred to as the Early Repurchase Deduction. Such share repurchase prices may be lower than the price at which you purchase our Common Shares in the Offering. The one-year holding period is measured as of the subscription closing date immediately following the prospective repurchase date. The Early Repurchase Deduction may be waived in the case of repurchase requests arising from the death, divorce or qualified disability of the holder. The Early Repurchase Deduction will be retained by the Company for the benefit of remaining common stockholders. 
 OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
 Other than contractual commitments and other legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of our business, we do not expect to have any off-balance sheet financings or liabilities. Our investment portfolio may contain investments that are in the form of lines of credit or unfunded commitments which require us to provide funding when requested by portfolio companies in accordance with the terms of the underlying agreements. Unfunded commitments to provide funds to portfolio companies are not reflected on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. These commitments are subject to the same underwriting and ongoing portfolio maintenance as are the on-balance sheet financial instruments that we hold. Since these commitments may expire without being drawn, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 we had aggregate unfunded commitments totaling 35.6 million and 5.6 million, respectively. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our commitments. 
 
 RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 
 
 On October 28, 2024, we announced the declaration of 0.16 per share regular and 0.07 per share special distributions for the Class I shares. The distributions for Class I shares are payable to shareholders of record as of the open of business on October 31, 2024 and will be paid on or about November 27, 2024. The distributions will be paid in cash or reinvested in the Class I shares for stockholders participating in our distribution reinvestment plan. 
 
 On November 1, 2024, pursuant to the Offering, we received 11.0 million in subscriptions from a third party unaffiliated investor. The purchase price per Class I share will equal our net asset value per Class I share as of the last calendar day of October 2024 (the October NAV ), which is generally expected to be available within 20 business days after November 1, 2024. At that time, the number of Class I shares issued to each investor based on the October NAV and such investor s subscription amount will be determined and Class I shares will be credited to the investor s account as of the effective date of the share purchase, November 1, 2024.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation and subject to the foregoing, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to accomplish their objectives at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 51 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 We are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, are any material legal proceedings threatened against us. We may be a party to certain lawsuits in the normal course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights under loans to or other contracts with our portfolio companies. Furthermore, third parties may try to seek to impose liability on us in connection with our activities or the activities of our portfolio companies. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. 

Item 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 Refer to Item 8.01 in our Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 26, 2024, August 27, 2024, September 27, 2024 and October 28, 2024 for information about unregistered sales of our equity securities during the quarter and subsequent to the quarter end. 
 Item 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES 
 None. 
 Item 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES 
 Not applicable. 
 Item 5. OTHER INFORMATION 
 Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans 
 During the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 , none of our directors or executive officers or any contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of our securities to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or any non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement.
