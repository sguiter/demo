 million and cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of million. The Company expects to incur additional losses and negative cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future. In July and August 2023, the Company completed its IPO, and inclusive of the partial exercise of the underwriters overallotment option, the Company sold an aggregate of shares of Series A common stock at a public offering price of per share and received million in net proceeds. In January 2024, the Company completed a follow-on offering whereby it sold shares of its Series A common stock at price of per share and received million in proceeds, net of issuance costs of million. T he Company expects that its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to fund the Company s operating expenses for at least the next 12 months from the issuance of these financial statements. In the future, the Company will need to raise additional funds until it is able to generate sufficient revenues to fund its development activities, if ever. The Company s future operating activities, coupled with its plans to raise capital or issue debt financing, may provide additional liquidity in the future, however these actions are not solely within the control of the Company and the Company is unable to predict the outcome of these actions to generate the liquidity ultimately required. In August 2024, the Company entered into a Controlled Equity Offering Sales Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald Co. to establish an at-the-market offering (ATM Offering) through which the Company may sell, from time to time at its sole discretion up to million of shares of its Series A common stock. There were sales under the ATM Offering during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 shares of Series A common stock and shares of Series B common stock. The rights of the holders of Series A common stock and Series B common stock are substantially identical, except with respect to voting and conversion. Each share of Series A common stock is entitled to one vote and shares of Series B common stock are non-voting, except as may be required by law. Each share of Series B common stock may be converted at any time into one share of Series A common stock at the option of its holder, subject to certain ownership limitations. As such, basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is presented on a combined basis as undistributed earnings, when allocated to each series of common stock, result in the same net loss per share for all periods presented. The following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands, except share and per share data): ) ) ) Denominator: Weighted-average shares of Series A and Series B common stock outstanding, basic and diluted Net loss per share of Series A and Series B common stock outstanding, basic and diluted ) ) ) ) The following potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from the computation of diluted weighted-average shares of Series A and Series B common stock outstanding, as their effect would have been anti-dilutive:

 million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These available for sale securities have expected maturities ranging from 0.3 to 16.8 months, and securities with an expected maturity greater than 12 months as of the balance sheet date, are classified in long-term. The fair value of marketable securities, which are Level 2 financial instruments, is based upon market prices quoted on the last day of the fiscal period or other observable market inputs. The Company obtains pricing information from its investment manager and generally determines the fair value of investment securities using standard observable inputs, including reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, bids and/or offers. The Company evaluates securities with unrealized losses, if any, to determine whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit loss or other factors, including various qualitative factors. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has not recognized any impairment or credit losses on the Company s available for sale securities. While the Company classifies these securities as available for sale, the Company does not intend to sell its investments and based on its current plans, the Company currently believes it has the ability to hold these investments until maturity. The carrying values of the Company s accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of these liabilities. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires management to make judgments and consider factors specific to the asset or liability. The Company s Level 3 liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist of the Series A common stock warrant liability related to the warrant to purchase shares of Series A common stock with an exercise price of per share and an expiration date of July 18, 2026, the third anniversary date of the closing of the Company s IPO. The fair value of Series A common stock warrant liability was immaterial as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, as well as the change in fair value during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. There were no transfers within the hierarchy during the periods presented.

 million as well as tiered royalties ranging from percentages in the high single digits to mid-teens on future net sales of denifanstat in Greater China. The license and the research and development services components of this license agreement are representative of a relationship with a customer, and therefore, the Company evaluated the license agreement under the provisions of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The developmental and commercial event-based milestone payments represent variable consideration, and the Company used the most likely amount method to estimate this variable consideration because the potential milestone payment is a binary event, as the Company will either receive the milestone payment or it will not. Given the high degree of uncertainty around achievement of these milestones, the Company determined the milestone amounts to be fully constrained and will not recognize revenue until the uncertainty associated with these payments is resolved. Any consideration related to royalties will be recognized if and when the related sales occur. The Company re-assesses the transaction price in each reporting period and when events whose outcomes are resolved or other changes in circumstances occur. In July 2023, the Company recognized million of revenue related to a development milestone triggered by the initial dosing of a Phase 3 trial for recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), of which million was received from Ascletis in August 2023, net of applicable taxes, which are recorded in general and administrative expense in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss. In July 2023, the Company entered into an Assignment and Assumption Agreement with Ascletis and Ascletis affiliate Gannex Pharma Co., Ltd. (Gannex) under which Ascletis, while remaining responsible for performance under the license agreement, assigned all of its rights and obligations under the license agreement to Gannex and Gannex assumed such rights and obligations, effective as of October 2019. Contract Research Organization In June 2024, the Company entered into a contract with a global CRO to perform certain research and related services in connection with certain of the Company s clinical trials and research studies (CRO Services Agreement). The terms of the CRO Services Agreement require the Company to pay to the CRO certain direct fees, investigator grants and other pass-through costs, generally on an upfront prepaid basis. These payments are capitalized at the time of payment and expensed in the period in which the research and development activity is performed. The Company may terminate the CRO Services Agreement or underlying statement of work at will with 60 days written notice. Facility lease agreement On March 12, 2019, the Company executed a 38-month non-cancelable operating lease agreement for square feet of office space for its headquarters facility in San Mateo, California, which commenced April 1, 2019. The lease provides for monthly payments of approximately with annual increases. In December 2021, the lease agreement was amended to extend the term of the lease through June 2024; in April 2024, the Company amended the lease agreement to (i) extend the lease through June 30, 2025 and (ii) increase the monthly lease payment to approximately beginning on July 1, 2024, which resulted in an increase in the Company s operating lease right-of-use asset and corresponding operating lease liability of million on the amendment date.

Guarantees and indemnifications In the normal course of business, the Company enters into agreements that contain a variety of representations and provide for general indemnification. The Company s exposure under these agreements is unknown because it involves claims that may be made against the Company in the future. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with members of its board of directors and its executive officers that will require the Company, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. To date, the Company has not paid any claims or been required to defend any action related to its indemnification obligations. As of September 30, 2024, the Company does not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible and consequently has not recorded related liabilities.

Inducement Pool grants are granted outside of the 2023 Plan and do not require approval from the Company s stockholders pursuant to the Nasdaq inducement grant exception in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c)(4).

 ITEM 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our unaudited condensed financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 (Quarterly Report). This discussion and analysis and other parts of this Quarterly Report contain forward-looking statements based upon our current plans and expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such as statements regarding our plans, objectives, expectations, intentions and beliefs. Our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. You should carefully read the Risk Factors section of this Quarterly Report to gain an understanding of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Overview We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics called fatty acid synthase (FASN) inhibitors that target dysfunctional metabolic and fibrotic pathways in diseases resulting from the overproduction of the fatty acid, palmitate. Our lead drug candidate, denifanstat, is an oral, once-daily pill and selective FASN inhibitor in development for the treatment of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), formerly known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Denifanstat has been studied in over 740 people to date in our clinical trials, including our Phase 2 FASCINATE-1 and Phase 2b FASINATE-2 clinical trials. In January 2024, we announced positive topline results from the Phase 2b FASCINATE-2 clinical trial evaluating denifanstat in 168 biopsy-confirmed MASH patients with stage F2 or F3 fibrosis compared to placebo at week 52. The Phase 2b FASCINATE-2 clinical trial achieved statistically significant results on primary and multiple secondary endpoints at week 52 in MASH patients in the modified intention to treat (mITT) population, including: The primary endpoints of 2-point reduction in NAS (NAFLD Activity Score) without worsening of fibrosis (denifanstat 52 vs. placebo 20 , p=0.0003), and MASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis with 2-point reduction in NAS (denifanstat 36 vs. placebo 13 , p=0.0044). Multiple secondary endpoints of fibrosis improvement by 1 stage with no worsening of MASH (denifanstat 41 vs. placebo 18 , p=0.0102), MASH resolution with no worsening of fibrosis (denifanstat 38 vs. placebo 16 , p=0.0043), and a greater proportion of MRI-derived proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) 30 responders relative to placebo (denifanstat 65 vs. placebo 21 , p Denifanstat showed also statistical significance in fibrosis improvement as measured by an artificial intelligence (AI) digital pathology-based qFibrosis assessment. Additionally, our precision medicine approach is core to our development strategy in MASH and includes the identification of pharmacodynamic and predictive biomarkers to confirm target engagement and clinical response in patients treated with denifanstat. In June 2024, we presented positive data from the Phase 2b FASCINATE-2 clinical trial of denifanstat versus placebo in biopsy-confirmed MASH patients at the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) Congress. Our EASL presentation included the following 52-week data from the intention to treat (ITT), mITT, and F3 mITT patient populations: The primary endpoint of 2-point reduction in NAS (NAFLD Activity Score) without worsening of fibrosis (denifanstat 38 vs. placebo 16 , p=0.0035) or MASH resolution with 2-point reduction in NAS without worsening of fibrosis (denifanstat 26 vs. placebo 11 , p=0.0173) in the ITT population. Secondary endpoints of fibrosis improvement by 1 stage with no worsening of MASH in the ITT (denifanstat 30 vs. placebo 14 , p=0.040) and F3 mITT (denifanstat 49 vs. placebo 13 , p=0.0032) populations. Fibrosis improvement by 2 stages with no worsening of MASH in the mITT (denifanstat 20 vs. placebo 2 , p=0.0065) and F3 mITT (denifanstat 34 vs. placebo 4 , p=0.0065) populations.

 A statistically significant difference in progression to cirrhosis (F4) in mITT population (denifanstat 5 vs. placebo 11 , p=0.0386). A statistically significant difference in fibrosis improvement by 1 stage with no worsening of MASH for patients on a stable background dose of a GLP-1RA (denifanstat 42 vs. placebo 0 , p=0.034) in the mITT population. A statistically significant increase in beneficial polyunsaturated triglycerides at the end of 52 week of treatment (+42 denifanstat vs. -4 placebo, p In October 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to denifanstat for the treatment of non-cirrhotic MASH with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis (consistent with stages F2 to F3 fibrosis). Treatments that receive Breakthrough Therapy designation must target a serious or life-threatening disease and preliminary clinical evidence must indicate that the drug may demonstrate a substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Breakthrough Therapy designation of denifanstat was supported by positive data from the Phase 2b FASCINATE-2 clinical trial in biopsy-confirmed MASH patients with stage 2 or stage 3 fibrosis. In October 2024, we completed successful end-of-Phase 2 interactions with the FDA, supporting the advancement of denifanstat into Phase 3 in MASH. Based on our ongoing discussions with the FDA, the phase 3 program will consist of two double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter registrational trials: FASCINATE-3 in patients with F2/F3 (non-cirrhotic) MASH: The trial is expected to evaluate the efficacy and safety of denifanstat in this population, with primary endpoints being liver biopsy assessments at 52 weeks, at which time Sagimet plans to seek accelerated approval in the U.S. and Europe. The trial will continue until such point in time that the required number of clinical outcomes is reached, which we estimate at 3.5 years. FASCINIT in patients with suspected or confirmed diagnosis of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD)/MASH: The trial is expected to evaluate the efficacy and safety of denifanstat in this population, with primary endpoints being safety and tolerability at 52 weeks. Non-invasive biomarkers will be assessed as part of the secondary endpoints, with no liver biopsy endpoint. 
 The Phase 3 program is designed to comprise a minimum of 1,800 patients exposed to denifanstat and is expected to initiate by the end of 2024. We are also evaluating the promise of FASN inhibition, beyond MASH, in additional disease areas in which dysregulation of fatty acid metabolism also plays a key role, including in acne and certain forms of cancer. Denifanstat is currently being tested in China by our license partner, Ascletis BioScience Co. Ltd. (Ascletis), a subsidiary of Ascletis Pharma Inc. (Ascletis Pharma), in a Phase 3 clinical trial for moderate to severe acne vulgaris and a Phase 3 clinical trial in recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in combination with bevacizumab. In November 2024, Ascletis announced completion of enrollment of 480 patients in the acne Phase 3 clinical trial and that it expects to announce topline results in the second quarter of 2025. We expect these results to inform our development strategy in these indications. We have completed Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies for a second FASN inhibitor, TVB-3567.

 Components of results of operations License revenue To date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales for the foreseeable future. Our revenues to date have been generated solely from the license agreement with Ascletis. We expect that our revenue for the next several years will be derived primarily from this agreement and any additional collaboration into which we may enter. Research and development expenses Research and development expenses represent costs incurred in performing research, development and manufacturing activities in support of our own product development efforts and include personnel-related costs (such as salaries, employee benefits and stock-based compensation) for our personnel in research and development functions; costs related to acquiring, developing and manufacturing supplies for preclinical studies, clinical trials and other studies, including fees paid to contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs); costs and expenses related to agreements with contract research organizations (CROs), investigative sites and consultants to conduct non-clinical and preclinical studies and clinical trials; professional and consulting services costs; and facility and other allocated costs. All research and development expenses are charged to operations as incurred in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 730 , Research and Development . We account for non-refundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities as expenses when the service has been performed or when the goods have been received, rather than when the payment is made. We expect our research and development expenses to increase substantially for the foreseeable future as we advance our drug candidates into and through preclinical studies and clinical trials, pursue regulatory approval and expand our pipeline. General and administrative expenses Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs and expenses related to: personnel (including salaries, employee benefits and stock-based compensation) in our executive, finance and accounting and other administrative functions; legal services, including relating to intellectual property and corporate matters; accounting, auditing, consulting and tax services; insurance; information technology; and facility and other allocated costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase substantially for the foreseeable future as we increase our headcount and continue to grow our corporate infrastructure. We also anticipate that we will incur increased expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses related to audit, legal and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and regulations and those of any national securities exchange on which our securities are traded, additional insurance expenses, investor relations activities and other administrative and professional services. Other income Other income consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities offset by accretion of discounts to maturity on our marketable securities.

 Results of operations Comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 The following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods indicated (in thousands): 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change License revenue 2,000 (2,000) (100) Operating expenses: Research and development 12,653 4,958 7,695 155 General and administrative 4,249 4,494 (245) (5) Total operating expenses 16,902 9,452 7,450 79 Loss from operations (16,902) (7,452) (9,450) 127 Total other income 2,283 1,099 1,184 nm Net loss (14,619) (6,353) (8,266) 130 nm not meaningful License revenue License revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was 2.0 million, recognized from the license agreement with Ascletis. We did not recognize any license revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Research and development Research and development expense increased by 7.7 million, or 155 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to (i) a 5.5 million net increase in clinical trial expenses related primarily to start-up costs incurred for our Phase 3 program of denifanstat in MASH, which was partially offset by lower clinical trial expenses for the Phase 2b FASCINATE-2 trial as the trial was substantially complete in the first quarter of 2024 and topline results for the trial were announced in January 2024, (ii) a 1.3 million increase in manufacturing costs for clinical batches of denifanstat in preparation for the Phase 3 clinical development program, and (iii) a 0.9 million increase in other non-clinical study costs for denifanstat. General and administrative General and administrative expenses decreased by 0.2 million, or 5 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to (i) a 0.3 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense and (ii) a 0.2 million decrease in tax expense recognized in conjunction with the development milestone received from Ascletis under the Ascletis license agreement in July 2023. This decrease in general and administrative expenses was partially offset by a 0.3 million increase in professional fees largely due to public company compliance activities. Other income Other income increased by 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase of interest income earned on the cash proceeds received from our initial public offering (IPO) and the January 2024 follow-on offering.

 Comparison of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 The following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods indicated (in thousands): 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change License revenue 2,000 (2,000) (100) Operating expenses: Research and development 24,228 14,121 10,107 72 General and administrative 12,031 9,153 2,878 31 Total operating expenses 36,259 23,274 12,985 56 Loss from operations (36,259) (21,274) (14,985) 70 Total other income 6,893 1,549 5,344 nm Net loss (29,366) (19,725) (9,641) 49 nm not meaningful License revenue License revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 2.0 million, recognized from the license agreement with Ascletis. We did not recognize any license revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Research and development Research and development expense increased by 10.1 million, or 72 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to (i) a 4.5 million increase in manufacturing costs for clinical batches of denifanstat in preparation for the Phase 3 clinical development program, (ii) a 3.8 million net increase in clinical trial expenses primarily related to start-up costs incurred for our Phase 3 program of denifanstat in MASH, which was partially offset by lower clinical trial expenses for the Phase 2b FASCINATE-2 trial as the trial was substantially complete in the first quarter of 2024 and topline results for the trial were announced in January 2024, and (iii) a 1.5 million increase in other non-clinical study costs for denifanstat. General and administrative General and administrative expenses increased by 2.9 million, or 31 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to (i) a 1.7 million increase in professional fees, largely due to public company compliance, (ii) a 0.4 million increase in personnel related expenses, largely driven by an increase in headcount, and (iii) a 0.5 million increase in insurance expenses due to our transition to a public company in 2023. Other income Other income increased by 5.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase of interest income earned on the cash proceeds received from our IPO and the January 2024 follow-on offering. Liquidity and capital resources Sources and uses of cash Since our inception, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to researching, discovering and developing our pipeline of proprietary FASN inhibitors and other drug targets, organizing and staffing our company, performing business planning, establishing our intellectual property portfolio, raising capital and general and administration activities to support and expand such activities. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. Our revenues to date have been generated solely from the license agreement with Ascletis. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through public and private equity and debt financings, including our IPO of Series A common stock in July 2023 and our follow-on offering in January 2024, from which we received aggregate net proceeds of 190.9 million. Prior to these public offerings, we raised 233.3 million in gross proceeds from the sale of our redeemable convertible preferred stock and convertible notes.

Table of Contents 
 In August 2024, we entered into a Controlled Equity Offering Sales Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald Co. to establish an at-the-market offering (ATM Offering) through which we may sell, from time to time at our sole discretion up to 75.0 million of shares of our Series A common stock. There were no sales under the ATM Offering during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of 170.0 million. We do not expect to generate any revenue from commercial product sales unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our drug candidates, which we expect will take a number of years, if ever. We anticipate that we will continue to incur significant expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue to advance our drug candidates through preclinical and clinical trials; manufacture supplies for our preclinical studies and clinical trials; expand our corporate infrastructure, including the costs associated with being a public company; pursue regulatory approval of our drug candidates; hire additional personnel; acquire, discover, validate and develop additional drug candidates; and obtain maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio. Until we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue from the commercialization of our drug candidates or additional revenue from collaboration agreements with third parties, if ever, we expect to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity or debt financings, third-party funding and marketing and distribution arrangements, as well as other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements, or any combination of these approaches. The sale of equity or convertible debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders and, in the case of preferred equity securities or convertible debt, those securities could provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock. Debt financings may subject us to covenant limitations or restrictions on our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Our ability to raise additional funds may be adversely impacted by macroeconomic conditions, disruptions to and volatility in the credit and financial markets and geopolitical turmoil. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in acquiring additional funding at levels sufficient to fund our operations or on terms favorable or acceptable to us. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing when needed or on terms favorable or acceptable to us, we may be forced to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research and development programs. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: difficulties obtaining regulatory approval to commence a clinical trial or complying with conditions imposed by a regulatory authority regarding the scope or term of a clinical trial; conditions imposed on us by the FDA or other regulatory authorities regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials; delays in reaching or failing to reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs, CMOs, and trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly; insufficient supply of our drug candidates or other materials necessary to conduct and complete our clinical trials; difficulties obtaining institutional review board (IRB) or ethics committee approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site; slow enrollment and retention rate of subjects in our clinical trials; the FDA or other regulatory authority requiring alterations to any of our study designs, our preclinical strategy or our manufacturing plans; governmental or regulatory delays and changes in regulatory requirements, policy and guidelines; serious and unexpected drug-related side effects related to the drug candidate being tested; lack of adequate funding to continue clinical trials; subjects experiencing severe or unexpected drug-related adverse effects;

 occurrence of severe adverse effects in clinical trials of the same class of agents conducted by other companies; any changes to our manufacturing process, suppliers or formulation that may be necessary or desired; 
 third-party vendors not performing manufacturing and distribution services in a timely manner or to sufficient quality standards; third-party clinical investigators losing the licenses or permits necessary to perform our clinical trials, not performing our clinical trials on our anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol, good clinical practice (GCP), or other regulatory requirements; third-party contractors not performing data collection or analysis in a timely or accurate manner; third-party contractors becoming debarred or suspended or otherwise penalized by the FDA or other government or regulatory authorities for violations of regulatory requirements, in which case we may need to find a substitute contractor, and we may not be able to use some or all of the data produced by such contractors in support of our marketing applications; and failure of our third-party contractors, such as CROs and CMOs, or our investigators to comply with regulatory requirements or otherwise meet their contractual obligations in a timely manner. 
 A change in the outcome of any of these or other variables could significantly change our costs and timing associated with the development of our drug candidates. Furthermore, our operating plans may change in the future, and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements associated with such change. We rely and will continue to rely on third parties in the conduct of our preclinical studies and clinical trials and for manufacturing and supply of our drug candidates. We have no internal manufacturing capabilities, and we will continue to rely on third parties for our preclinical study and clinical trial materials. Given our stage of development, we do not yet have a marketing or sales organization or commercial infrastructure. Accordingly, if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our drug candidates, we also expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. We enter into contracts in the normal course of business for products and services, including contract research and contract manufacturing services, which include provisions allowing for termination under certain conditions and timelines. These contracts generally do not include payments for early termination and are considered cancellable contracts. Based on our current business plans, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024, will be sufficient for us to fund our operating expenses for at least the next 12 months from the issuance of this Quarterly Report. Cash flows The following table shows a summary of our cash flows for each of the periods presented below (in thousands): 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash (used in) provided by: Operating activities (31,411) (16,683) Investing activities (71,533) 32,200 Financing activities 104,819 86,167 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 1,875 101,684 Cash flows from operating activities. Net cash used in operating activities was 31.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and primarily related to cash used to fund clinical development, manufacturing and other non-clinical activities for denifanstat, inclusive of clinical-batch manufacturing and other trial start-up costs for our Phase 3 program of denifanstat in MASH, as well as costs to build out our corporate infrastructure and costs associated with being a public company. 

 26 

Table of Contents 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 16.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and primarily related to cash used to fund clinical development and other pre-clinical activities for denifanstat, primarily relating to the Phase 2b FASCINATE-2 trial for which topline results were announced in January 2024, as well as other costs to support our corporate infrastructure. Cash expenses were offset by the net 1.7 million development milestone received from Ascletis in connection with the Ascletis license agreement during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash flows from investing activities - Net cash used in investing activities was 71.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and related to purchases of marketable securities of 94.3 million, partially offset by proceeds received from the sale and maturity of marketable securities of 22.8 million. Net cash provided by investing activities was 32.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which related solely to proceeds received from sales of marketable securities. Cash flows from financing activities - Net cash provided by financing activities was 104.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, w hich primarily related to net cash proceeds of 105.7 million received from the sale of Series A common stock in our January 2024 follow-on offering and 0.1 million in proceeds from stock option exercises during the period, offset by the payment of financing costs related to the January 2024 follow-on offering of 1.0 million. Net cash provided by financing activities was 86.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which related primarily to the proceeds received from our IPO, net of underwriters' commissions and discounts. Critical accounting policies and estimates We prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made and changes in estimates may occur. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to our critical accounting estimates or in the methodology used for estimates from those described in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Emerging growth company and smaller reporting status We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the JOBS Act). Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. Other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements under the JOBS Act for emerging growth companies include an exemption from the requirement to provide an auditor s report on internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, an exemption from any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation and less extensive disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements. We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date that (i) we are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) we affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with the new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of our first fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of 1.235 billion or more, (ii) December 31, 2028, (iii) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, under the rules of the SEC, which means the market value of equity securities that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700.0 million as of the prior June 30th and (iv) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.

Table of Contents 
 We are also a smaller reporting company, meaning that the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700 million and our annual revenue was less than 100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 250 million or (ii) our annual revenue is less than 100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700 million. If we are a smaller reporting company at the time we cease to be an emerging growth company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies. Specifically, as a smaller reporting company we may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and, similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation. Recently adopted accounting pronouncements See Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies, included in our unaudited interim financial statements in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for more information. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, (Exchange Act), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in this Quarterly Report was (a) reported within the time periods specified by the SEC rules and regulations, and (b) communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding any required disclosure. Changes in internal control over financial reporting During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. Our management believes that there are currently no claims or actions pending against us, the ultimate disposition of which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, nor are we aware of any governmental proceedings involving potential monetary sanctions.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors Our business is subject to substantial risks and uncertainties. You should carefully consider the information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the risks and uncertainties described below, and the risk factors and other information contained in our other public filings in evaluating our business, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the SEC on March 25, 2024. Although we have received Breakthrough Therapy designation for denifanstat, this may not lead to a faster development, regulatory review or approval process, and it does not increase the likelihood of receiving marketing approval in the United States. In October 2024, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to denifanstat for the treatment of non-cirrhotic MASH with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis (consistent with stages F2 to F3 fibrosis). A Breakthrough Therapy is defined as a therapy that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other therapies, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the therapy may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. For therapies that have been designated as breakthrough therapies, interaction and communication between the FDA and the sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens. Therapies designated as breakthrough therapies by the FDA may also be eligible for priority review and accelerated approval. The Breakthrough Therapy designation we have obtained for denifanstat may not result in faster development processes, reviews or approvals compared to therapies considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, the FDA may later decide that our denifanstat development program no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. In addition, the FDA may later decide that denifanstat no longer meets the conditions for qualification. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds Recent sales of unregistered equity securities There were no unregistered sales of equity securities during the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Use of proceeds from initial public offering of common stock On July 18, 2023, we completed our IPO. Our registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-256648) relating to the IPO was declared effective by the SEC on July 13, 2023. We issued an aggregate of 5,312,500 shares of our Series A common stock at a price of 16.00 per share. The aggregate gross proceeds of the IPO were 96.4 million, inclusive of an additional 714,272 shares of Series A common stock sold upon the partial exercise of the underwriters' purchase option. We received approximately 86.2 million in net proceeds after deducting approximately 6.7 million in underwriting discounts and commissions and approximately 3.5 million in other offering costs. None of the expenses associated with the IPO were paid to directors, officers, persons owning 10 or more of any class of equity securities, or to their associates, or to our affiliates. Goldman Sachs Co., Cowen and Company and Piper Sandler Co. acted as joint book-running managers for the IPO, and JMP Securities acted as lead manager. There has been no material change in our planned use of the net proceeds from the IPO as described in our final prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) under the Securities Act with the SEC on July 17, 2023. Issuer purchases of equity securities None. Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities Not applicable.
