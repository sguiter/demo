 Notes to Unaudited F inancial Statements 
 September 30, 2024 
 general shares (the General Shares of the Fund. The fiscal year end of the Fund is December 31st. The Fund establishes long positions in certain futures contracts (the DX Contracts ), with a view to tracking the changes, whether positive or negative, in the level of the Deutsche Bank Long USD Currency Portfolio Index Excess Return TM (the Index ), over time. The performance of the Fund also is intended to reflect the excess, if any, of the sum of the Fund s interest income from its holdings of United States Treasury Obligations Treasury Income ), dividends from its holdings in money market mutual funds (affiliated or otherwise) Money Market Income and dividends or distributions of capital gains from its holdings of T-Bill ETFs (as defined below) T-Bill ETF Income over the expenses of the Fund. The Fund may invest directly in United States Treasury Obligations. The Fund may also gain exposure to United States Treasury Obligations through investments in exchange-traded funds ETFs (affiliated or otherwise) that track indexes that measure the performance of United States Treasury Obligations with a maximum remaining maturity of up to months T-Bill ETFs ). The Fund holds as collateral United States Treasury Obligations, money market mutual funds and T-Bill ETFs (affiliated or otherwise), if any, for margin and/or cash management purposes. While the Fund's performance reflects the appreciation and depreciation of those holdings, the Fund's performance, whether positive or negative, is driven primarily by its strategy of trading futures contracts with the aim of seeking to track the Index. If the Managing Owner determines in its commercially reasonable judgment that it has become impracticable, including in scenarios wherein the futures market for a DX Contract is thinly traded, or inefficient for any reason for the Fund to gain full or partial exposure to a DX Contract, the Fund may invest in: a different month DX Contract other than the specific DX Contract that was originally required by the Index, 

 another futures contract substantially similar to the DX Contracts, if available, 

 the futures contracts referencing the Index Currencies, or 

 a forward agreement, swap, or other OTC derivative referencing the Index Currencies, 

 if, in the commercially reasonable judgment of the Managing Owner, such an instrument tends to exhibit trading prices that correlate with the DX Contract. The Index is calculated to reflect the changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, of long positions in DX Contracts. DX Contracts are traded through the currency markets of ICE Futures U.S. (formerly known as the New York Board of Trade ), under the symbol DX. The Index reflects the changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, of the DX Contracts which expire during the months of March, June, September and December. The Fund seeks to track the Index by establishing long positions in DX Contracts. DX Contracts are linked to the six underlying currencies (the Index Currencies of the ICE U.S. Dollar Index (USDX (the USDX ). The Index Currencies are the Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Swedish Krona and Swiss Franc. The notional amounts of the Index Currencies included in the USDX reflect a geometric weighted average of the change in the Index Currencies exchange rates against the U.S. dollar relative to March 1973. March 1973 was chosen as a base period of the USDX because it represents a significant milestone in foreign exchange history when the world s major trading nations allowed their currencies to float freely against each other. The Fund offers common units of beneficial interest (the Shares only to certain eligible financial institutions (the Authorized Participants in or more blocks of Shares Creation Units ). The Fund commenced investment operations on February 15, 2007. The Fund commenced trading on the American Stock Exchange (which became the NYSE Alternext US LLC) on February 20, 2007 and, since November 25, 2008, has been listed on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (the NYSE Arca ). This Quarterly Report (the Report covers the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The accompanying unaudited financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP for interim financial information and with the instructions for Form 10-Q and the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). In the opinion of management, all material adjustments, consisting only of

and per round-turn trade during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively. On average, total charges paid to the Commodity Broker, as applicable, were less than and per round-turn trade during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively.

per annum of the daily NAV of the Fund (the Management Fee ). The Fund, for cash management purposes, invests in money market mutual funds and/or T-Bill ETFs that are managed by affiliates of the Managing Owner. The indirect portion of the management fee that the Fund incurs through such investments is in addition to the Management Fee paid to the Managing Owner. The Managing Owner has contractually agreed to waive indefinitely the fees that it receives in an amount equal to the indirect management fees that the Fund incurs through its investments in affiliated money market mutual funds and/or affiliated T-Bill ETFs. The Managing Owner may terminate this fee waiver on notice. The Managing Owner waived fees of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively. The Managing Owner waived fees of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The Distributor Invesco Distributors, Inc. (the Distributor provides certain distribution services to the Fund. Pursuant to the Distribution Services Agreement among the Managing Owner, the Fund and the Distributor, the Distributor assists the Managing Owner and the Fund s administrator, The Bank of New York Mellon, with certain functions and duties relating to distribution and marketing services to the Fund including reviewing and approving marketing materials. The Managing Owner pays the Distributor a distribution fee out of the Management Fee.

cash equivalents held by the Fund as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Fund considers investments in money market funds to be investments in securities and, accordingly, includes them in its Schedule of Investments. The Fund may deposit cash, United States Treasury Obligations, T-Bill ETFs and money market mutual funds with the Commodity Broker as margin, to the extent permissible under CFTC rules. The combination of the Fund s deposits with its Commodity Broker of cash and United States Treasury Obligations and the unrealized profit or loss on open futures contracts represents the Fund s overall equity in its broker trading account. To meet the Fund s maintenance margin requirements, the Fund holds United States Treasury Obligations with the Commodity Broker. The Fund transfers cash to the Commodity Broker to satisfy variation margin requirements. The Fund earns interest on any excess cash deposited with the Commodity Broker and incurs interest expense on any deficit balance with the Commodity Broker. The brokerage agreement with the Commodity Broker provides for the net settlement of all financial instruments covered by the agreement in the event of default or termination of any one contract. The Managing Owner will utilize any excess cash held at the Commodity Broker to offset any realized losses incurred in the currency futures contracts, if available. To the extent that any excess cash held at the Commodity Broker is not adequate to cover any realized losses, a portion of the United States Treasury Obligations and T-Bill ETFs, if any, on deposit with the Commodity Broker will be sold to make additional cash available. For financial reporting purposes, the Fund offsets financial assets and financial liabilities that are subject to legally enforceable netting arrangements. The Fund s remaining cash, United States Treasury Obligations, T-Bill ETFs and money market mutual fund holdings are on deposit with the Custodian. The Fund is permitted to temporarily carry a negative or overdrawn balance in its account with the Custodian. The Fund incurs interest expense on any overdraft balance with the Custodian. Such balances, if any at period-end, are shown on the Statements of Financial Condition under the payable caption Due to custodian. Because the Fund s assets are maintained with the Commodity Broker and Custodian, the distress, impairment or failure of the Commodity Broker or Custodian could result in the loss of or delay in access to Fund assets.

By placing a creation order, and prior to delivery of such Creation Units, an Authorized Participant s Depository Trust Company DTC account is charged the non-refundable transaction fee due for the creation order. Unless otherwise agreed to by the Managing Owner and the Authorized Participant as provided in the next sentence, Creation Units are issued on the creation order settlement date as of 2:45 p.m., Eastern Time, on the business day immediately following the creation order date at the applicable NAV per Share as of the closing time of the NYSE Arca or the last to close of the exchanges on which its futures contracts are traded, whichever is later, on the creation order date, but only if the required payment has been timely received. Upon submission of a creation order, the Authorized Participant may request the Managing Owner to agree to a creation order settlement date up to one business day after the creation order date. (b) Redemptions 

 On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Transfer Agent to redeem or more Creation Units. Redemption orders must be placed by 1:00 p.m., Eastern Time. The day on which the Managing Owner receives a valid redemption order is the redemption order date. The day on which a redemption order is settled is the redemption order settlement date. Cash settlement occurs at the redemption order settlement date. As provided below, the redemption order settlement date may occur up to one business day after the redemption order date. The redemption procedures allow Authorized Participants to redeem Creation Units. Individual Shareholders may not redeem directly from the Fund. Instead, individual Shareholders may only redeem Shares in integral multiples of and only through an Authorized Participant. Unless otherwise agreed to by the Managing Owner and the Authorized Participant as provided in the next sentence, by placing a redemption order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deliver the Creation Units to be redeemed through DTC s book-entry system to the Fund no later than the redemption order settlement date as of 2:45 p.m., Eastern Time, on the business day immediately following the redemption order date. Upon submission of a redemption order, the Authorized Participant may request the Managing Owner to agree to a redemption order settlement date up to one business day after the redemption order date. By placing a redemption order, and prior to receipt of the redemption proceeds, an Authorized Participant s DTC account is charged the non-refundable transaction fee due for the redemption order. The redemption proceeds from the Fund consist of the cash redemption amount. The cash redemption amount is equal to the NAV of the number of Creation Unit(s) requested in the Authorized Participant s redemption order as of the closing time of the NYSE Arca or the last to close of the exchanges on which the Fund s futures contracts are traded, whichever is later, on the redemption order date. The Managing Owner will distribute the cash redemption amount at the redemption order settlement date as of 2:45 p.m., Eastern Time, on the redemption order settlement date through DTC to the account of the Authorized Participant as recorded on DTC s book-entry system. The redemption proceeds due from the Fund are delivered to the Authorized Participant at 2:45 p.m., Eastern Time, on the redemption order settlement date if, by such time, the Fund s DTC account has been credited with the Creation Units to be redeemed. If the Fund s DTC account has not been credited with all of the Creation Units to be redeemed by such time, the redemption distribution is delivered to the extent of whole Creation Units received. Any remainder of the redemption distribution is delivered on the next business day to the extent of remaining whole Creation Units received if the Transfer Agent receives the fee applicable to the extension of the redemption distribution date which the Managing Owner may, from time to time, determine and the remaining

 Overview/Introduction 
 Invesco DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund (the Fund ), a separate series of Invesco DB US Dollar Index Trust (the Trust ), was formed as a Delaware statutory trust on August 3, 2006. The term of the Fund is perpetual (unless terminated earlier in certain circumstances) as provided for in the Fifth Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement of the Trust, as amended (the Trust Agreement ). The Fund has an unlimited number of shares authorized for issuance. 
 Invesco Capital Management LLC has served as the managing owner (the Managing Owner ), commodity pool operator and commodity trading advisor of the Trust and the Fund since February 23, 2015. The Managing Owner is registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC as a commodity pool operator and a commodity trading advisor, and it is a member firm of the National Futures Association NFA ). 
 The Fund establishes long positions in certain futures contracts (the DX Contracts ), with a view to tracking the changes, whether positive or negative, in the level of the Deutsche Bank Long USD Currency Portfolio Index Excess Return TM (the Index ), over time. The performance of the Fund also is intended to reflect the excess, if any, of the sum of the Fund s interest income from its holdings of United States Treasury Obligations Treasury Income ), dividends from its holdings in money market mutual funds (affiliated or otherwise) Money Market Income and dividends or distributions of capital gains from its holdings of T-Bill ETFs (as defined below) T-Bill ETF Income over the expenses of the Fund. 
 19 

The Fund may invest directly in United States Treasury Obligations. The Fund may also gain exposure to United States Treasury Obligations through investments in exchange-traded funds ETFs (affiliated or otherwise) that track indexes that measure the performance of United States Treasury Obligations with a maximum remaining maturity of up to 12 months T-Bill ETFs ). The Fund holds as collateral United States Treasury Obligations, money market mutual funds and T-Bill ETFs (affiliated or otherwise), if any, for margin and/or cash management purposes. While the Fund s performance reflects the appreciation or depreciation of those holdings, the Fund s performance, whether positive or negative, is driven primarily by its strategy of trading DX contracts with the aim of seeking to track the Index. 
 If the Managing Owner determines in its commercially reasonable judgment that it has become impracticable, including in scenarios wherein the futures market for a DX Contract is thinly traded, or inefficient for any reason for the Fund to gain full or partial exposure to a DX Contract, the Fund may invest in: 
 a different month DX Contract other than the specific DX Contract that was originally required by the Index, 

another futures contract substantially similar to the DX Contracts, if available, 

the futures contracts referencing the Index Currencies, or 

a forward agreement, swap, or other OTC derivative referencing the Index Currencies, 

if, in the commercially reasonable judgment of the Managing Owner, such an instrument tends to exhibit trading prices that correlate with the DX Contract. 
 The Index is calculated to reflect the changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, of long positions in DX Contracts. DX Contracts are traded through the currency markets of ICE Futures U.S. (formerly known as the New York Board of Trade ), under the symbol DX. The Index reflects the changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, of the DX Contracts which expire during the months of March, June, September and December. The Fund seeks to track the Index by establishing long positions in DX Contracts. DX Contracts are linked to the six underlying currencies (the Index Currencies of the ICE U.S. Dollar Index (USDX (the USDX ). The Index Currencies are the Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Swedish Krona and Swiss Franc. The notional amounts of the Index Currencies included in the USDX reflect a geometric weighted average of the change in the Index Currencies exchange rates against the U.S. dollar relative to March 1973. March 1973 was chosen as a base period of the USDX because it represents a significant milestone in foreign exchange history when the world s major trading nations allowed their currencies to float freely against each other. 
 The Fund offers common units of beneficial interest (the Shares only to certain eligible financial institutions (the Authorized Participants in one or more blocks of 50,000 Shares Creation Units ). The Fund commenced investment operations on February 15, 2007. The Fund commenced trading on the American Stock Exchange (which became the NYSE Alternext US LLC) on February 20, 2007 and, since November 25, 2008, has been listed on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (the NYSE Arca ).

 Market Risk 
 Trading in futures contracts involves the Fund entering into contractual commitments to purchase a particular currency at a specified date and price. The market risk associated with the Fund s commitments to purchase currencies is limited to the gross or face amount of the contracts held. 
 The Fund s exposure to market risk is also influenced by a number of factors including the volatility of interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, the liquidity of the markets in which the contracts are traded and the relationships among the contracts held. The inherent uncertainty of the Fund s trading as well as the development of drastic market occurrences could ultimately lead to a loss of all or substantially all of the investors capital. 
 21 

Credit Risk 
 When the Fund enters into futures contracts, the Fund is exposed to credit risk that the counterparty to the contract will not meet its obligations. The counterparty for futures contracts traded on United States and on most foreign futures exchanges is the clearing house associated with the particular exchange. In general, clearing houses are backed by their corporate members who may be required to share in the financial burden resulting from the nonperformance by one of their members and, as such, is designed to disperse and mitigate the credit risk posed by any one member. In cases where the clearing house is not backed by the clearing members (i.e., some foreign exchanges), it may be backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions. There can be no assurance that any counterparty, clearing member or clearinghouse will meet its obligations to the Fund. 
 The Commodity Broker, when acting as the Fund s futures commission merchant FCM in accepting orders for the purchase or sale of domestic futures contracts, is required by CFTC regulations to separately account for and segregate as belonging to the Fund all assets of the Fund relating to domestic futures trading. The Commodity Broker is not allowed to commingle such assets with other assets of the Commodity Broker. In addition, CFTC regulations also require the Commodity Broker to hold in a secure account assets of the Fund related to foreign futures trading. While these legal requirements are designed to protect the customers of FCMs, a failure by the Commodity Broker to comply with those requirements would be likely to have a material adverse effect on the Fund in the event that the Commodity Broker became insolvent or suffered other financial distress. 
 Liquidity 
 The Fund s entire source of capital is derived from the Fund s offering of Shares to Authorized Participants. The Fund in turn allocates its net assets to currency futures trading. A significant portion of the NAV is held in United States Treasury Obligations, which may be used as margin for the Fund s trading in currency futures contracts and United States Treasury Obligations, money market mutual funds, cash and T-Bill ETFs, if any, which may be used for cash management purposes. The percentage that United States Treasury Obligations bear to the total net assets will vary from period to period as the market values of the Fund s currency futures change. A portion of the Fund s United States Treasury Obligations is held for deposit with the Commodity Broker to meet margin requirements. All remaining cash, money market mutual funds, T-Bill ETFs, if any, and United States Treasury Obligations are on deposit with the Custodian. Interest earned on the Fund s interest-bearing funds and dividends from the Fund s holdings of money market mutual funds are paid to the Fund. Any dividends or distributions of capital gains received from the Fund s holdings of T-Bill ETFs, if any, are paid to the Fund. 
 The Fund s currency futures contracts may be subject to periods of illiquidity because of market conditions, regulatory considerations or for other reasons. For example, U.S. futures exchanges and some foreign exchanges have regulations that limit the amount of fluctuation in futures contract prices that may occur during a single business day. These limits are generally referred to as daily price fluctuation limits or daily limits, and the maximum or minimum price of a contract on any given day as a result of these limits is referred to as a limit price. Once a limit price has been reached in a particular contract, it is usually the case that no trades may be made at a different price than specified in the limit. The duration of limit prices generally varies. Limit prices may have the effect of precluding the Fund from trading in a particular contract or requiring the Fund to liquidate contracts at disadvantageous times or prices. Either of those outcomes could adversely affect the Fund s ability to pursue its investment objective. 
 Because the Fund trades futures contracts, its capital is at risk due to changes in the value of futures contracts (market risk) or the inability of counterparties (including the Commodity Broker and/or exchange clearinghouses) to perform under the terms of the contracts (credit risk). 
 On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Transfer Agent to redeem one or more blocks of 50,000 Shares Creation Units ). Redemption orders must be placed by 1:00 p.m., Eastern Time. The day on which the Managing Owner receives a valid redemption order is the redemption order date. The day on which a redemption order is settled is the redemption order settlement date. As provided below, the redemption order settlement date may occur up to one business day after the redemption order date. Redemption orders are irrevocable. The redemption procedures allow Authorized Participants to redeem Creation Units. Individual Shareholders may not redeem directly from the Fund. Instead, individual Shareholders may only redeem Shares in integral multiples of 50,000 and only through an Authorized Participant. 
 Unless otherwise agreed to by the Managing Owner and the Authorized Participant as provided in the next sentence, by placing a redemption order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deliver the Creation Units to be redeemed through DTC s book-entry system to the Fund no later than the redemption order settlement date as of 2:45 p.m., Eastern Time, on the business day immediately following the redemption order date. Upon submission of a redemption order, the Authorized Participant may request the Managing Owner to agree to a redemption order settlement date up to one business day after the redemption order date. By placing a redemption order, and prior to receipt of the redemption proceeds, an Authorized Participant s DTC account is charged the non-refundable transaction fee due for the redemption order. 
 22 

Redemption orders may be placed either (i) through the Continuous Net Settlement CNS clearing processes of the National Securities Clearing Corporation (the NSCC (the CNS Clearing Process or (ii) if outside the CNS Clearing Process, only through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company DTC or the Depository (the DTC Process ), or a successor depository, and only in exchange for cash. By placing a redemption order, and prior to receipt of the redemption proceeds, an Authorized Participant s DTC account is charged the non-refundable transaction fee due for the redemption order and such fee is not borne by the Fund. 
 The Fund is unaware of any known trends or any known demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in the Fund's liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way. 
 Capital Resources 
 The Fund does not have any material cash requirements as of the end of the latest fiscal period. The Fund is unaware of any known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, in the Fund s capital resources. 
 In the normal course of its business, the Fund is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk. The term off-balance sheet risk refers to an unrecorded potential liability that, even though it does not appear on the balance sheet, may result in a future obligation or loss. The financial instruments used by the Fund are currency futures, the values of which are based upon an underlying asset and generally represent future commitments which have a reasonable possibility to be settled in cash or through physical delivery. The financial instruments are traded on an exchange and are standardized contracts. 
 The Fund has not utilized, nor does it expect to utilize in the future, special purpose entities to facilitate off-balance sheet financing arrangements and has no loan guarantee arrangements or off-balance sheet arrangements of any kind, other than agreements entered into in the normal course of business noted above, which may include indemnification provisions related to certain risks service providers undertake in providing services to the Fund. While the Fund s exposure under such indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, these general business indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the Fund s financial position. The Managing Owner expects the risk of loss relating to indemnification to be remote. 
 The Fund has financial obligations to the Managing Owner and the Commodity Broker under the Trust Agreement and its agreement with the Commodity Broker (the Commodity Broker Agreement ), respectively. Management Fee payments made to the Managing Owner, pursuant to the Trust Agreement, are calculated as a fixed percentage of the Fund s NAV. Commission payments to the Commodity Broker, pursuant to the Commodity Broker Agreement, are on a contract-by-contract, or round-turn, basis. As such, the Managing Owner cannot anticipate the number of payments that will be required under these arrangements for future periods as NAVs and trading activity will not be known until a future date. The Fund s agreement with the Commodity Broker may be terminated by either party for various reasons. All Management Fees and commission payments are paid to the Managing Owner and the Commodity Broker, respectively. 
 Cash Flows 
 A primary cash flow activity of the Fund is to raise capital from Authorized Participants through the issuance of Shares. This cash is used to invest in United States Treasury Obligations, money market mutual funds and T-Bill ETFs, if any, and to meet margin requirements as a result of the positions taken in DX Contracts to match the fluctuations of the Index. 
 As of the date of this Report, each of ABN AMRO Clearing Chicago LLC, Bank of America Securities, BMO Capital Markets Corp., BNP Paribas Securities Corp., BofA Securities, Inc., Cantor Fitzgerald Co., Citadel Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Goldman Sachs Co., Goldman Sachs Execution Clearing LP, Interactive Brokers LLC, Jane Street Capital LLC, Jefferies LLC, JP Morgan Securities Inc., Morgan Stanley Co.

 Operating Activities 
 Net cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities was 102.6 million and 1,155.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These amounts primarily include net income (loss), net purchases and sales of money market mutual funds and net purchases and sales of United States Treasury Obligations which are held at fair value on the Statements of Financial Condition. The Fund may hold United States Treasury Obligations, money market mutual funds and T-Bill ETFs (affiliated or otherwise), for margin and/or cash management purposes. While the Fund s performance reflects the appreciation and depreciation of those holdings, the Fund s performance, whether positive or negative, is driven primarily by its strategy of trading DX Contracts with the aim of seeking to track the Index. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 219.2 million was paid to purchase United States Treasury Obligations and 322.9 million was received from sales and maturing United States Treasury Obligations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, 924.6 million was paid to purchase United States Treasury Obligations and 1,310.0 million was received from sales and maturing United States Treasury Obligations. 677.6 million was received from sales of affiliated investments and 686.0 million was paid to purchase affiliated investments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 1,806.8 million was received 
 23 

from sales of affiliated investments and 1,056.8 million was paid to purchase affiliated investments during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Financing Activities 
 The Fund s net cash flow provided by (used in) financing activities was (103.7) million and (1,160.6) million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This included 658.0 million and 748.7 million from Shares purchased by Authorized Participants and 761.7 million and 1,909.3 million from Shares redeemed by Authorized Participants during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. No distributions were paid to Shareholders during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Results of Operations 
 FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023 
 The following graphs illustrate the percentage changes in (i) the market price of the Shares (as reflected by the line Market ), (ii) the Fund s NAV (as reflected by the line NAV ), and (iii) the closing levels of the Index (as reflected by the line Deutsche Bank Long USD Currency Portfolio Index-Excess Return TM ). Whenever the Treasury Income, Money Market Income and T-Bill ETF Income, if any, earned by the Fund exceeds Fund expenses, the price of the Shares generally exceeds the level of the Index at that time primarily because the Share price reflects Treasury Income, Money Market Income and T-Bill ETF Income, if any, from the Fund s collateral holdings whereas the Index does not consider such income. There can be no assurance that the price of the Shares or the Fund s NAV will exceed the Index levels. 
 No representation is being made that the Index will or is likely to achieve closing levels consistent with or similar to those set forth herein. Similarly, no representation is being made that the Fund will generate profits or losses similar to the Fund s past performance or changes in the Index closing levels.

If the Fund s Treasury Income, Money Market Income and T-Bill ETF Income were to exceed the Fund s fees and expenses, the aggregate return on an investment in the Fund would be expected to outperform the Index and underperform the Long Index TR TM . The only difference between (i) the Index (the Excess Return Index and (ii) the Long Index-TR TM (the Total Return Index is that the Excess Return Index does not include interest income from a hypothetical Creation Unit of fixed income securities while the Total Return Index does include such a component. Thus, the difference between the Excess Return Index and the Total Return Index is attributable entirely to the interest income attributable to the fixed income securities reflected in the Total Return Index. The Total Return Index does not actually hold any fixed income securities. If the Fund s Treasury Income, Money Market Income and T-Bill ETF Income, if any, exceeds the Fund s fees and expenses, then the amount of such excess is expected to be distributed periodically. The market price of the Shares is expected to closely track the Excess Return Index. The aggregate return on an investment in the 
 26 

Fund over any period is the sum of the capital appreciation or depreciation of the Shares over the period, plus the amount of any distributions during the period. Consequently, the Fund s aggregate return is expected to outperform the Excess Return Index by the amount of the excess, if any, of the Fund s Treasury Income, Money Market Income and T-Bill ETF Income over its fees and expenses. As a result of the Fund s fees and expenses, however, the aggregate return on the Fund is expected to underperform the Total Return Index. If the Fund s fees and expenses were to exceed the Fund s Treasury Income, Money Market Income and T-Bill ETF Income, if any, the aggregate return on an investment in the Fund is expected to underperform the Excess Return Index. 
 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 
 Fund Share Price Performance 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the NYSE Arca market value of each Share decreased from 29.14 per Share to 28.18 per Share. The Share price low and high for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and related change from the Share price on June 30, 2024 was as follows: Shares traded at a low of 27.95 per Share (-4.08 on August 27, 2024 and a high of 29.14 per Share (0.00 on July 1, 2024. The total return for the Fund on a market value basis was -3.29 . 
 The US dollar was heavily pressured in the third quarter of 2024, leading to losses for the Fund. In addition to the highly anticipated Federal Reserve easing cycle which officially kicked off in September the central bank announced a larger-than-expected interest rate cut of 0.50 the Bank of Japan also surprised the market with a rate hike in August. Higher interest rates generally boost a country s currency and vice versa; in this case, the events boosted the Japanese yen and pressured the US dollar. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the NYSE Arca market value of each Share increased from 28.40 per Share to 29.73 per Share. The Share price low and high for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and related change from the Share price on June 30, 2023 was as follows: Shares traded at a low of 27.56 per Share (-2.96 on July 13, 2023 and a high of 29.87 per Share (+5.18 on September 27, 2023. The total return for the Fund on a market value basis was +4.68 . 
 The U.S. dollar showed strength in the third quarter of 2023, up 3 , the most since the third quarter 2022, leading to gains for the Fund. The euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, Swedish krona and Swiss franc all depreciated against the U.S. dollar. European currencies were pressured by a weakening Eurozone economic outlook and relatively more bearish central banks, while the Bank of Japan kept to its ultra-dovish policies, keeping global interest rate differentials with the Japanese yen wide open. Compared to the other currencies, the Canadian dollar fared better, supported by the strong rebound in energy commodities the country is a major exporter of crude oil. 

Fund Share Net Asset Performance 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the NAV of each Share decreased from 29.14 per Share to 28.18 per Share. Falling currency futures contract prices for long DX Contracts during the three months ended September 30, 2024, contributed to a 4.44 decrease in the level of the Index and to a 3.17 decrease in the level of the Long Index-TR TM . The total return for the Fund on a NAV basis was -3.29 . 
 Net income (loss) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was (11.4) million, primarily resulting from 4.6 million of income, net realized gain (loss) of (10.0) million, net change in unrealized gain (loss) of (5.4) million and net operating expenses of 0.7 million. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the NAV of each Share increased from 28.39 per Share to 29.71 per Share. Rising currency futures contract prices for long DX Contracts during the three months ended September 30, 2023 contributed to a 3.49 increase in the level of the Index and to a 4.88 increase in the level of the Long Index-TR TM . The total return for the Fund on a NAV basis was +4.65 . 
 Net income (loss) for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was 21.8 million, primarily resulting from 7.2 million of income, net realized gain (loss) of 11.7 million, net change in unrealized gain (loss) of 3.9 million and net operating expenses of 1.0 million.

FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 
 
 Fund Share Price Performance 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the NYSE Arca market value of each Share increased from 27.09 per Share to 28.18 per Share. The Share price low and high for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and related change from the Share price on December 31, 2023 was as follows: Shares traded at a low of 27.33 per Share (0.89 on January 2, 2024 and a high of 29.17 per Share (7.68 on June 26, 2024. The total return for the Fund on a market value basis was +4.02 . 
 The US dollar performed positively in the first three quarters of 2024, leading to positive performance for the Fund. While the dollar had fallen to end 2023 on expectations for imminent rate cuts, the Federal Reserve stuck to its higher-for-longer rhetoric through the first two quarters of the year as US inflation proved stickier than expected. This forced the market to repeatedly delay Federal Reserve easing expectations at the same time that many global economies including Switzerland, Sweden, Canada, and the European Central Bank (ECB) kicked off their rate-cutting cycles. However, the greenback moved lower in the third quarter with the Federal Reserve joining the others, announcing its first interest rate cut in September. Furthermore, the Bank of Japan surprised the market with a rate hike in August, sending the Japanese yen higher. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the NYSE Arca market value of each Share increased from 27.81 per Share to 29.73 per Share. The Share price low and high for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and related change from the Share price on December 31, 2022 was as follows: Shares traded at a low of 27.26 per Share (-1.98 on February 1, 2023, and a high of 29.87 per Share (+7.41 on September 27, 2023. The total return for the Fund on a market value basis was +6.90 . 
 The U.S. dollar posted a small gain in the first three quarters of 2023 leading to gains for the Fund while it moved lower during the first quarter, prices rebounded during the second and third quarters. To start the year, the U.S. dollar retreated rapidly on anticipation for a dovish pivot in the Federal Reserve s interest rate hike plans. However, in February, expectations for the Federal Reserve turned more hawkish amid stickier-than-expected US inflation and a strong US labor market. In March, while the dollar initially continued higher on the financial sector turmoil, returning speculation for a softer Federal Reserve stance, amid the heightened uncertainty, sent prices lower to end the quarter. Despite continued talks for a pause in US interest rate hikes, which actually happened in June, the U.S. dollar remained relatively well supported in the second quarter on hawkish Federal Reserve comments. In the third quarter, the U.S. dollar experienced renewed strength amid US economic resilience and the Federal Reserve s more hawkish, higher-for-longer rhetoric. 

Fund Share Net Asset Performance 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the NAV of each Share increased from 27.08 per Share to 28.18 per Share. Rising currency futures contract prices for long DX Contracts during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, contributed to a 0.55 increase in the level of the Index and to a 4.64 increase in the level of the Long Index-TR TM . The total return for the Fund on a NAV basis was 4.06 . 
 Net income (loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 15.8 million, primarily resulting from 15.2 million of income, net realized gain (loss) of 0.3 million, net change in unrealized gain (loss) of 2.5 million and net operating expenses of 2.1 million. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the NAV of each Share increased from 27.81 per Share to 29.71 per Share.

The total return for the Fund on a NAV basis was +6.83 . 
 Net income (loss) for the nine months ended September 30 2023 was 39.0 million, primarily resulting from 32.5 million of income, net realized gain (loss) of (1.6) million, net change in unrealized gain (loss) of 13.3 million and net operating expenses of 5.1 million.

There were no material estimates, which involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and had or are reasonably likely to have had a material impact on the Fund's financial condition, used in the preparation of these financial statements. 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
 INTRODUCTION 
 The Fund is designed to track the performance of the Index. The market sensitive instruments held by it are subject to the risk of trading loss. Unlike an operating company, the risk of market sensitive instruments is integral, not incidental, to the Fund s main line of business. 
 Market movements can produce frequent changes in the fair market value of the Fund s open positions and, consequently, in its earnings and cash flow. The Fund s market risk is primarily influenced by changes in the prices of currencies. 
 QUANTIFYING THE FUND S TRADING VALUE AT RISK 
 Quantitative Forward-Looking Statements 
 The following quantitative disclosures regarding the Fund s market risk exposures contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor from civil liability provided for such statements by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (set forth in Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act). All quantitative disclosures in this section are deemed to be forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor, except for statements of historical fact (such as the dollar amount of maintenance margin required for market risk sensitive instruments held at the end of the reporting period). 
 Value at Risk VaR is a statistical measure of the value of losses that would not be expected to be exceeded over a given time horizon and at a given probability level arising from movement of underlying risk factors. Loss is measured as a decline in the fair value of the portfolio as a result of changes in any of the material variables by which fair values are determined. VaR is measured over a specified holding period (one day) and to a specified level of statistical confidence (99th percentile). However, the inherent uncertainty in the markets in which the Fund trades and the recurrence in the markets traded by the Fund of market movements far exceeding expectations could result in actual trading or non-trading losses far beyond the indicated VaR or the Fund s experience to date (i.e., risk of ruin ). In light of these considerations, as well as the risks and uncertainties intrinsic to all future projections, the following VaR presentation does not constitute any assurance or representation that the Fund s losses in any market sector will be limited to VaR. 
 THE FUND S TRADING VALUE AT RISK 
 The Fund calculates VaR using the actual historical market movements of the Fund s net assets. 
 The following table indicates the trading VaR associated with the Fund s net assets as of September 30, 2024. 

For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024

The VaR represents the one day downside risk, under normal market conditions, with a 99 confidence level. It is calculated using historical market moves of the Fund s net assets and uses a one year look back.

THE FUND S NON-TRADING MARKET RISK 
 The Fund has non-trading market risk as a result of investing in short-term United States Treasury Obligations, T-Bill ETFs and money market mutual funds. The market risk represented by these investments is not expected to be material. Although the Fund purchases and sells shares of T-Bill ETFs on an exchange, it does not establish or liquidate those positions for trading purposes. 
 QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES REGARDING PRIMARY TRADING RISK EXPOSURES 
 The following qualitative disclosures regarding the Fund s market risk exposures except for those disclosures that are statements of historical fact constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. The Fund s primary market risk exposures are subject to numerous uncertainties, contingencies and risks. Government interventions, defaults and expropriations, illiquid markets, the emergence of dominant fundamental factors, political upheavals, changes in historical price relationships, an influx of new market participants, increased regulation and many other factors could result in material losses as well as in material changes to the risk exposures of the Fund. The Fund s current market exposure may change materially. Investors may lose all or substantially all of their investment in the Fund. 
 Several factors may affect the price of the Index Currencies (which underlie the DX Contracts), including, but not limited to: 
 National debt levels and trade deficits, including changes in balances of payments and trade; 

Domestic and foreign inflation rates and investors expectations concerning inflation rates; 

Domestic and foreign interest rates and investors expectations concerning interest rates; 

Currency exchange rates; 

Investment and trading activities of mutual funds, hedge funds and currency funds; 

Global or regional political, economic or financial events and situations; 

Supply and demand changes which influence the foreign exchange rates of various currencies; 

Monetary policies of governments (including exchange control programs, restrictions on local exchanges or markets and limitations on foreign investment in a country or on investment by residents of a country in other countries), trade restrictions, currency devaluations and revaluations; 

Governmental intervention in the currency market, directly and by regulation, in order to influence currency prices; and 

Expectations among market participants that a currency s value soon will change. 

QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES REGARDING NON-TRADING MARKET RISK EXPOSURE 
 As noted above, the Fund has non-trading market risk as a result of investing in short-term United States Treasury Obligations, T-Bill ETFs and money market mutual funds. The market risk represented by these investments is not expected to be material. 
 QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES REGARDING MEANS OF MANAGING RISK EXPOSURE 
 Under ordinary circumstances, the Managing Owner s exercise of discretionary power is limited to determining whether the Fund will make a distribution. Under emergency or extraordinary circumstances, the Managing Owner s use of its discretionary powers may increase. These special circumstances, for example, include the unavailability of the Index or certain natural or man-made disasters. The Managing Owner does not actively manage the Fund to avoid losses. The Fund only takes long positions in investments and does not employ stop-loss techniques.
