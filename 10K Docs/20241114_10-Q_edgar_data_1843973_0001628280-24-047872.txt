These forward-looking statements are based on information available as of the date and current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and involve a number of judgments, risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date, and we do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws. 
 
 Therefore, actual outcomes and results may, and are likely to, differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements due to numerous factors discussed from time to time in this Report as well as the risks described under Item 1A - Risk Factors, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in other documents which we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ).

 the risks associated with our indebtedness, including the Senior Note (as defined herein), and our debt's potential impact on our business and financial condition;

Net cash flows (used) provided by operating activities were ) and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. A significant component of the Company s operating losses and working capital deficit resulted from increased general and administrative costs associated with becoming a public company.

 The Company believes its cash and cash equivalents on hand, operating cash flows, and proceeds from the fractional program will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditure requirements, for at least 12 months from the issuance date of these financial statements. However, the Company might need additional capital to fund growth plans or as circumstances change, which it would expect to obtain through equity issuances, refinancing existing debt or new borrowings. Adequate capital may not be available to the Company when needed or on acceptable terms. If the Company is unable to raise capital, it could be forced to delay, reduce, suspend or cease its working capital requirements, capital expenditures and business development efforts, which would have a negative impact on its business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.

 The outstanding principal balance under the Bridge Notes (as defined in Note 16 "Debt"), which, including additions to the principal balance as a result of the accumulation of paid in kind interest was immediately prior to the closing of the Merger, was automatically converted into shares of flyExclusive Class A Common Stock. 
 The Merger was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Under this method of accounting, EGA was treated as the acquired company for financial reporting purposes, whereas LGM was treated as the accounting acquirer. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Merger was treated as the equivalent of LGM issuing shares for the net assets of EGA, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of EGA were stated at historical cost with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded, and operations prior to the Merger are those of LGM. As a result of the Merger, the Company is organized in an umbrella partnership corporation ("Up-C") structure in which substantially all of the assets of the combined company are held by LGM, and flyExclusive's only assets are its equity interests in LGM.

 Deferred Underwriting Fee Agreement 
 On December 27, 2023, in conjunction with the closing of the Merger, the Company and the underwriter entered into agreements (the "Amended Underwriting Agreement" and the "Amended Letter Agreement") to amend the terms of the original deferred underwriting agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement"), dated May 25, 2021, and the original letter agreement (the "Letter Agreement"), dated August 1, 2022. 
 The Amended Underwriting Agreement changed the payment terms of the Underwriting Agreement from a payment of to the underwriter at the closing of the Merger to a payment of at the closing of the Merger and shares of flyExclusive Class A Common Stock to be issued to the underwriter no later than five ) days following the initial filing of a registration statement with the SEC. The Amended Underwriting Agreement includes a provision that states that if the registration statement is not deemed to be effective within sixty ) business days of the closing of the Merger, the amount of share consideration payable to the underwriter shall increase by shares (the "Additional Stock") of the Company's common stock per month on the first business day of each month until the registration statement is declared effective. On January 16, 2024, the Company entered into a waiver agreement with the underwriter to waive the Additional Stock penalty if the Form S-1 is not declared effective within sixty ) business days after the consummation of the Merger. 
 The Company determined the obligation to issue shares to the underwriter was a registration payment arrangement that should be accounted for under ASC 825-20-25-1, "Financial Instruments - Registration Payment Arrangements", which indicates that the contingent obligation to issue additional stock should be treated as a separate unit of account. 
 The obligation to issue shares meets the definition of a derivative under ASC 815. However, the obligation meets the derivative scope exception within ASC 815-40 and therefore is not accounted for as a derivative and is classified within stockholders' equity in the condensed consolidated balance sheets (unaudited). Since the obligation to issue shares is equity-classified, the Company measured the fair value of the obligation to issue shares at inception and will not remeasure the fair value at each subsequent reporting period. The Company utilized a Finnerty Put Option Model to determine the fair value of the obligation to issue shares due to the presence of a discount for lack of marketability as the shares issuable to the underwriter will not be marketable until a registration statement is declared effective. The key inputs to the valuation model to estimate the fair value of the share obligation included volatility, share price, strike price, dividend yield, and the estimated registration effectiveness date. The Company issued shares of flyExclusive Class A Common Stock to the underwriter as of February 8, 2024. 
 As of December 31, 2023, the registration payment arrangement to contingently issue shares per month was classified as a contingent liability in accordance with ASC 825-20-30-5. The Company did not record a contingent liability

 Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) (continued) business days of the closing of the Merger. The contingent liability was not relevant as of September 30, 2024 due to the waiver of the Additional Stock penalty as noted above. 
 The Amended Letter Agreement amended the timing of the one-time, fee (the "Success Fee") payable to the underwriter from being due at the closing of the Merger to being due within sixty ) days of the closing of the Merger, which was subsequently paid.

 Fair Value Measurements at December 31, 2023 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Assets: Cash equivalents: Money market mutual funds Investments in Securities Liabilities: Warrant liability - public warrants Warrant liability - private placement warrants 
 The fair values of government money market funds have been measured on a recurring basis using Level 1 inputs, which are based on unadjusted quoted market prices within active markets. The short-term investments, including investments in fixed income securities, have been measured using quoted pricing on active markets for Level 1 investments and inputs based on alternative pricing sources and models utilizing observable market inputs for Level 2 investments. 
 The fair value of the Public Warrants is classified as Level 1 due to the use of an observable market quote in an active market. The fair value of the Private Placement Warrants is classified as Level 2 due to the use of an observable market quote for the Public Warrants, which are considered to be a similar asset in an active market. The warrant liability is calculated by multiplying the quoted market price of the Company s Public Warrants by the total number of Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants.

 Employee Retention Credit ERC 
 The CARES Act, which was enacted on March 27, 2020, provides an ERC that is a refundable tax credit against certain employer taxes. The ERC was subsequently amended by the Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2020, the Consolidated Appropriation Act of 2021, and the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, all of which amended and extended the ERC availability and guidelines under the CARES Act. The goal of the ERC program is to encourage employers to retain and continue paying employees during periods of pandemic-related reduction in business volume even if those employees are not actually working, and therefore, are not providing a service to the employer. 
 Under the Act, eligible employers could take credits up to 70 of qualified wages with a limit of 7 per employee per quarter for the first three quarters of calendar year 2022. In order to qualify for the ERC in 2022, organizations generally have to experience a more than 20 decrease in gross receipts in the quarter compared to the same quarter in calendar year 2019 or its operations are fully or partially suspended during a calendar quarter due to orders from an appropriate governmental authority limiting commerce, travel, or group meetings (for commercial, social, religious, or other purposes) due to COVID-19. The credit is taken against the Company s share of Social Security Tax when the Company s payroll provider files, or subsequently amends the applicable quarterly employer tax filings. 
 . The Company s legal counsel has issued a legal opinion that the Company, more likely than not, qualified for the ERC. However, it remains uncertain whether the Company meets the eligibility qualifications required for the ERC. Therefore, the balance was included in Other current liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets (unaudited) as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 since the Company may potentially be required to repay the ERC.

 to years and sometimes the borrowers negotiate with the lenders to extend the maturity date at the end of the initial term. The Company will refinance as needed to meet its obligations as they become due within the next 12 months. The Company has maintained a positive relationship with the lenders and has not historically had any difficulty refinancing these debt obligations. Based on historical experience and the fact that the Company has not suffered any decline in creditworthiness, it expects that cash on hand and cash earnings will enable it to secure the necessary refinancing. Amendments are executed at times when interest rates and terms are changed. Under these long-term loan agreements, these borrowers usually pay principal and interest payments each month, followed by a balloon payment of all unpaid principal and accrued and unpaid interest due upon maturity, and when applicable, a loan origination fee upon execution. Each note payable is collateralized by the specific aircraft financed and is guaranteed by the owners of the borrowers. 
 The lender may impose a restriction that the outstanding balance of the note may not exceed a percentage of the retail value of the collateral. In the event the outstanding value of the loan exceeds the percentage threshold of the collateralized aircraft, the borrowers may be required to make a payment in order to reduce the balance of the loan. Pursuant to the loan agreements, the borrowers must maintain certain debt service ratios (such as cash flow to leverage or certain EBITDA to total borrowings) specific to each lender as long as the borrowers hold outstanding loans. There were approximately separate loan agreements (each loan agreement includes the initial agreement and amendments if applicable) with note payable balances outstanding as of September 30, 2024, down from separate loan agreements as of December 31, 2023.

Each term loan will be used to finance the purchase of aircraft and shall not exceed certain appraised value of the aircraft that is being financed. 
 Interest accrues on the unpaid principal balance at a rate equal to the Overnight LIBOR-Based Rate (a per annum rate of interest which is equal to the greater of: (i) the floor rate , and (ii) the sum of Overnight LIBOR plus

 Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) (continued) 

 . The entire remaining principal balance of the loan, plus all accrued but unpaid interest shall be due and payable on the fifth-year anniversary of the promissory note (the Term Loan Maturity Date ). Any installment of principal or interest on the loans which are not paid when due shall bear a default interest rate equal to the lesser of (i) the applicable LIBOR-based rate plus per annum, or (ii) the highest rate then permitted by applicable law. A late charge of of any payment will be imposed on any regularly scheduled payment not received by the Lender on or before days from the date such payment is due. 
 The Lender has the right to have any financed aircraft appraised during any outstanding obligations, at the Company s sole cost and expense. In the event the loan is revealed to have a value greater than a certain percentage of the aircraft, the Company must make a mandatory repayment of the applicable loan to an amount that will reduce the loan to be less than the required percentage of the applicable appraised value. Pursuant to the term loan agreement, the Company must maintain a certain debt service coverage ratio (the ratio calculated by dividing EBITDA and sum of all loan payments), tested annually. There is also an optional prepayment clause which specifies that the Company may prepay any loans in whole or in part, and all prepayments of principal shall include interest accrued to the date of the prepayment on the principal amount being prepaid. 
 The Credit Facility contains clauses requiring the Company to maintain their limited liability companies existence and to not permit any of the subsidiaries to liquidate, dissolve, change their names, or consolidate with other corporations without prior consent of the Lender. The original loan agreement states that the Company may not re-borrow any amounts repaid to the Lender. The term loan is collateralized by substantially all assets of the borrower and initially expires August 2019. The Credit Facility also contains other customary covenants, representations and events of default. 
 In August 2019, the Company entered into the First Amendment of the original term loan agreement which increased the maximum available borrowings of the Credit Facility to and extended the Term Loan Maturity Date to November 2020. The First Amendment also amended the covenant to require the Company to maintain a certain Fixed Charge Coverage ratio tested on the date immediately preceding each borrowing and upon receipt of quarterly financial statements.

 In September 2022, the Company entered into the Third Amendment of the term loan agreement which increased maximum available borrowings of the Credit Facility to and extended the Term Loan Maturity Date to September 2024. The Third Amendment also states that the Company may repay any outstanding loan at any time and any amounts so repaid may be reborrowed, up to the Maximum Loan Amount at the time of such borrowing. The Third Amendment also amended the interest rate terms and provided the option to elect a rate per year equal to SOFR-Based Rate or the Prime-Based Rate. 
 In December 2023, the Company entered into the Fourth Amendment of the term loan agreement which decreased maximum available borrowings of the Credit Facility to . The Company elected to utilize the SOFR-Based Rate upon execution of the amendment and continued to pay interest based on the SOFR-Based Rate as of September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate outstanding balances on the term loan were and , respectively, and the Company had approximately and additional available borrowing capacity under the term loan, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 the term loans bear maturity dates from December 2024 to April 2027.

The Company agrees to pay accrued interest monthly on the 9th day of each month, beginning with the first of such dates to occur after the date of the first Loan, at maturity of this note, and upon payment in full, whichever is earlier or more frequent. After maturity, whether by acceleration or otherwise, interest shall be payable upon demand. The Company may prepay any principal bearing interest at any Interest Rate Option in whole or in part without breakage fee, penalty or premium; provided, however, that if a swap agreement with a Daily Simple SOFR-Based Rate is in effect between Lender and the Company in connection with a Loan made pursuant to this LOC Master Note, any applicable swap breakage fees, penalties, premiums and costs will apply. There is no swap agreement in place as of September 30, 2024. 
 The LOC Master Note contains customary representations and warranties and financial and other affirmative and negative covenants and is subject to acceleration upon certain specified events of default, including failure to make timely payments, breaches of certain representations or covenants, failure to pay other material indebtedness, failure to maintain the market value of the collateral such that at all times it equals or exceeds the Minimum Liquidity Balance and certain other events of default. 
 All payments shall be made in immediately available funds and shall be applied first to accrued interest and then to principal; however, if an Event of Default occurs, Lender may in its sole discretion, and in such order as it may choose, apply any payment to interest, principal and/or lawful charges and expenses then accrued. 
 The Company drew an initial principal amount in March 2023, with the selected interest option of SOFR plus .

 Financial covenants contained in the debt borrowings mandate that the Company maintains certain financial metrics, including, but not limited to, debt service coverage ratios, fixed charge cover ratios, or cash flow cover ratios. If the Company is unable to maintain the financial metric, it is a breach of the debt covenant and is considered an event of default. An event of default can result in all loans and other obligations becoming immediately due and payable, including the advance of any sums necessary to cure the event of default, allowing the lenders to seize the collateralized assets, aircraft and the debt agreements being terminated. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company was not in compliance with certain financial covenants and obtained waiver request letters from the various lenders.

The shares were purchased by the underwriter from a public stockholder that elected to reverse its redemption of shares of EGA Class A common stock. The shares were purchased for a total purchase price of per share) and the underwriter received reimbursement of from EGA s Trust Account on December 27, 2023, as well as reimbursement for the remaining from the Company on January 2, 2024. Simultaneously with the closing of the Merger, the shares of EGA Class A common stock were automatically exchanged for shares of non-redeemable flyExclusive, Inc. Class A Common Stock and shares (out of the above-mentioned shares) were granted to employees of the Company as compensation for services provided (the grant date for the shares was determined to be December 27, 2023). The shares of flyExclusive Class A Common Stock were fully vested upon grant. As of December 31, 2023, all shares were still legally considered to be owned by the underwriter. On January 2, 2024, the shares were transferred from the underwriter to the Company, at which time the Company became the owner of record. On January 9, 2024, shares were transferred from flyExclusive, Inc. s ownership to the employee grantees and these shares all had flyExclusive employees listed as the owners of record. The shares of Class A Common Stock not issued to employees were still held by the Company and classified as treasury stock as of September 30, 2024. 
 Events Related to the Amended Underwriting Agreement 
 On May 10, 2024, the Company filed a registration statement on amended Form S-1, subsequently amended, that was declared effective on September 20, 2024, to register (a) the issuance of up to an aggregate of shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of our Public Warrants and (b) the resale from time to time of (i) up to an aggregate of outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock, (ii) Private Placement Warrants, (iii) up to an aggregate of shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants, and (iv) up to an aggregate of shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon the redemption of LGM Common Units. 
 Noncontrolling Interest

 On March 26, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement with the noncontrolling interests of certain controlled and consolidated aircraft leasing entities to exchange ownership interests involving aircraft and their related entities. The purpose of the transactions was to give the Company ownership of certain aircraft. These transfers are accounted for as equity transactions and gain or loss was recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. These transfers are included within Acquisitions of non controlling interests on the condensed consolidated statements of shareholders' equity (deficit) / members' equity (deficit) and temporary equity (unaudited). The carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities of the consolidated aircraft leasing entities are not changed. The carrying amounts of the noncontrolling interests are adjusted to reflect the change in the ownership interests of each consolidated aircraft leasing entity.

 Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest 
 The redeemable noncontrolling interest relates to the LGM Common Units held by the Class B Common Stockholders. On the Closing Date of the merger (Refer to Note 4 "Merger"), the redeemable noncontrolling interest was established and calculated as the product of its ownership percentage in the Company on the Closing Date, and the carrying value of the LGM net liabilities immediately prior to the Closing Date. This resulted in a negative initial carrying value of at December 31, 2023, presented within temporary equity on the condensed consolidated statements of shareholders' equity (deficit) / members' equity (deficit) and temporary equity (unaudited). 
 The redeemable noncontrolling interest is not redeemable until the anniversary date of the Closing Date, or December 27, 2024; however, as of its establishment on the Closing Date it was probable of becoming redeemable as its potential future redemption was only dependent upon the passage of time. Therefore, the subsequent measurement of the redeemable noncontrolling interest at each reporting date is determined as the higher of (1) the initial carrying value, increased or decreased for the redeemable noncontrolling interest's share of net income or loss, or (2) the redemption value.

 Overview of Our Business 
 flyExclusive is a premier owner and operator of curated private aviation experiences dedicated to surpassing passenger expectations for quality, convenience, and safety. Our mission is to be the world s most vertically integrated private aviation company through capital-efficient program growth, an industry-leading pricing model, optimal dispatch availability, in-house training, and a controlled premium customer experience on modernized aircraft. As of September 30, 2024, we had 88 aircraft in our owned and leased fleet that includes light, midsize, super-midsize, and large jets. As one of the nation s largest Citation operators, flyExclusive has curated a versatile fleet of Citation CJ3 / CJ3+, Citation Excel / XLS / XLS+, Citation Encore+, Citation Sovereign, Citation X, and Challenger 350 aircraft. We have a long track record of success and growth across a full range of industry services. Our core competitive advantage is the purpose-built, in-house control of decisions and processes needed to operate a successful private aviation company through a range of market environments. 
 We have a diversified and evolving business model generating charter revenue through our jet club membership program, guaranteed revenue program GRP , which ended in June 2023), fractional program, and maintenance, repair, and overhaul MRO program. Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer review the financial information presented on a consolidated basis, and accordingly, we operate under one reportable segment, which is charter aviation services. 
 Jet club revenue is generated from flight operations as well as membership fees. Jet club members are guaranteed access to our fleet of light, midsize and super-midsize aircraft. New members pay a minimum deposit of 0.1 million up to a maximum of 0.5 million depending on their level of membership. Membership levels determine the daily rate a member is charged for future flights. Membership and incidental fees are also applied against a member s account. The initial and all subsequent deposits to replenish the member s account are non-refundable. 
 GRP revenue is derived from contracts with wholesale customers whereby the customer commits to utilize a specified minimum number of hours per quarter in exchange for guaranteed access to aircraft. Each aircraft requires a deposit that is recorded on the balance sheet. Revenue is billed weekly and guaranteed based on contract rates for light, midsize, and super-midsize aircraft. Contract terms allow us to bill for ancillary services based on the circumstances of a flight. Rates are assessed each quarter to account for changes in fuel cost. We did not derive any revenue from GRP subsequent to June 30, 2023 and do not anticipate future revenue from GRP. See discussion of the termination of the GRP Agreement in the following section. 
 Fractional ownership members purchase a fractional ownership interest in an aircraft for a contractual term of up to five years, which grants the member access to our light, midsize and super mid-size fleets. Fractional members pay daily and hourly rates for each flight. The first stage of the fractional revenue stream is the pre-owner stage where the member signs a letter of intent and interim use agreement, which may be before the aircraft is available. At this time, the member pays two deposits: one deposit is towards the purchase of the fractional interest and the second deposit is to have the ability to use the fleet in the interim period prior to owning the fractional interest. Upon completion of enrollment in the program, fractional members who purchase new aircraft obtain ownership when the aircraft is delivered, expected to be approximately one year from when the aircraft is ordered from the manufacturer. Fractional members have the ability to advance ownership if they purchase an interest in one of our pre-owned fractional aircraft. Once the transfer of interest in 
 47 

the aircraft is complete, the member becomes a fractional owner in the aircraft. With the transfer of interest, flyExclusive is still able to utilize these aircraft to service other channels, providing us with a capital-light way to grow our fleet. 
 Our MRO program services include 24/7 maintenance, interior, and exterior refurbishment services to third parties in addition to maintaining our own fleet. MRO revenue is recognized over time based on the cost of parts and supplies inventory consumed and labor hours worked for each service provided. Any billing for MRO services that exceeds revenue earned to date is included in deferred revenue on the condensed consolidated balance sheets (unaudited). 
 
 On September 2, 2024, the Company entered into an Aircraft Management Services Agreement (the Volato Agreement with Volato Group, Inc. Volato ). Pursuant to the Volato Agreement, Volato engaged the Company as an independent contractor to provide certain aircraft management services and agreed that the Company will be the exclusive provider of such services to Volato. As consideration payable to the Company for providing the services, the Company will be entitled to retain the excess of revenue collected over expenses in connection with its delivery of services under the Volato Agreement. 
 The Volato Agreement has a term of twelve months and may be terminated by the Company immediately upon a material breach of the Agreement by Volato or upon 30 days written notice to Volato. Volato may terminate the Agreement immediately upon a material breach of the Agreement by the Company. During the term of the Agreement, certain Volato employees will provide consulting services to the Company, including consulting services related to software development, sales, and other professional services. The cost to the Company of these consulting services will be the current salaries and benefit costs of the Volato employees engaged to provide the services, plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Volato has also agreed to grant the Company a non-exclusive license to Volato s proprietary software pursuant to the terms and conditions of a mutually agreeable software license, with a license fee equal to the documented, out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Volato with third-party vendors and only to the extent related solely and directly to the software. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will manage flight operations, sales and expenses of Volato s fleet, consisting of 13 fully fractionalized aircraft, 8 leased aircraft and 4 managed aircraft. The aircraft will remain on Volato's Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA") certificate until they are potentially moved to the Company's FAA certificate. 
 
 Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations 
 We believe that the following factors have affected our financial condition and results of operations and are expected to continue to have a significant effect: 
 Economic Conditions 
 If demand for private aviation services were to decrease, it could result in slower jet club growth, members declining to renew their memberships and reduced interest in the fractional and partnership programs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our customers may consider private air travel through our products and services to be a luxury item, especially when compared to commercial air travel or not traveling by air at all. As a result, any general downturn in economic, business and financial conditions which has an adverse effect on our customers spending habits could cause them to travel less frequently and, to the extent they travel, to travel using commercial air carriers or other means considered to be more economical than our products and services. In addition, in cases where significant hours of private flight are needed, many of the companies and high-net-worth individuals to whom we provide products and services have the financial ability to purchase their own aircraft or operate their own corporate flight department should they elect to do so. 
 Competition 
 Many of the markets in which we operate are competitive as a result of the expansion of existing private aircraft operators, expanding private aircraft ownership and alternatives such as luxury commercial airline service. We compete against a number of private aviation operators with different business models, and local and regional private charter operators. Factors that affect competition in our industry include price, reliability, safety, regulations, professional reputation, aircraft availability, equipment, the quality, consistency and ease of service, willingness and ability to serve specific airports or regions and investment requirements. Our competitors might capture a share of our present or potential customer base, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 48 

Pilot Availability and Attrition 
 In recent years, we have experienced significant volatility in our attrition, including volatility resulting from training delays, pilot wage and bonus increases with other industry participants and the growth of cargo, low-cost and ultra-low-cost airlines. In prior periods, these factors, at times, caused our pilot attrition rates to be higher than our ability to hire and retain replacement pilots. If our attrition rates are higher than our ability to hire and retain replacement pilots, our operations and financial results could be materially and adversely affected. 
 Wheels Up WUP Termination 
 On June 30, 2023, we served WUP a Notice of Termination of the parties Fleet Guaranteed Revenue Program Agreement, dated November 1, 2021 (the GRP Agreement ). As a result of the termination, the GRP program did not generate revenue following the date of the GRP Agreement s termination, which had a material impact on the financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2023. For some time prior to the termination of the GRP Agreement we were planning, for the strategic reasons of avoiding excessive reliance on a single customer and shifting towards focusing on wholesale and contractual retail customers, to scale down business with WUP, and we had already reflected scaled down revenue accordingly in our publicly disclosed projections. However, the termination of the GRP Agreement might have a material impact on the financial statements beyond 2023 until we are able to successfully effectuate this planned strategic shift and replace the revenue lost from the termination of the GRP Agreement. Additionally, as of June 27, 2023, WUP accounted for 15.7 million in receivables, which was a significant majority of total receivables at that time. When the agreement with WUP was terminated on June 30, 2023 the receivable balances were eliminated, as allowable under relevant accounting standards, by being applied against existing deposits held under the GRP Agreement. The GRP Agreement provided for an orderly draw down period of the designated aircraft at a maximum of two aircraft per month. The Company submitted a bill for monies due under the GRP Agreement during the draw down period through July 31, 2024. Billed but unrecorded amounts through September 30, 2024 totaled 59.0 million. 
 See the section entitled Risk Factors Risks Relating to LGM - On June 30, 2023, we terminated our agreement with Wheels Up that accounted for a significant portion of our total revenues the past two years. Such termination could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition if we fail to materially replace the revenue derived from Wheels Up moving forward as expected in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and Note 23 "Commitments and Contingencies" of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements (unaudited) consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report, for more information on the WUP termination. 
 Fleet Modernization 
 During the fourth quarter of 2023, we began the process of modernizing our fleet. Our plan is to sell a portion of our fleet that is older and non-performing and replace those aircraft with newer models, which will grant our customers access to newer aircraft. In connection with this effort, within the first nine months of 2024, we recorded a portion of the fleet as being held for sale. We expect the fleet modernization to take place over the next two years and do not anticipate a material decline to revenue as we will replace sold models with the newer aircraft which offer increased availability and operating efficiency. 
 
 Business Impact of COVID-19 
 In March 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. During the first half of 2020, in order to minimize the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operating costs and cash flows we took a number of temporary actions, including offering voluntary furloughs to our employees, implementing a mandatory reduction in all work schedules and delaying certain planned initiatives and internal investments. Since that time, we have reduced or eliminated the majority of these temporary actions. However, as a result of the increased rate of COVID-19 spread during a portion of the fourth quarter of 2021 and into the first quarter of 2022, flight volumes were negatively impacted, primarily due to a combination of customer cancellations, access to third-party supply and reduced crew availability resulting from COVID-19 exposure. These negative impacts could occur again at any time. Moving forward, however, we believe that COVID-19 pandemic has led to a shift in consumer prioritization of wellness and safety, with private aviation viewed increasingly by those in the addressable market as a health-conscious decision rather than a discretionary luxury. We believe this will translate into an increase in flight demand over time. 
 49 

CARES Act 
 On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law. The CARES Act provided the airline industry with up to (i) 25.0 billion in grants with assurances the support is to be used exclusively for employee salaries, wages and benefits, and (ii) 25.0 billion in secured loans. 
 We applied to the Treasury for assistance under the Payroll Support Program and the Paycheck Protection Program as established by the CARES Act. We were awarded 23.6 million to support ongoing operations, all of which has been received. 
 The CARES Act support payments were conditioned, including certain restrictions on executive and other employee compensation and severance through April 1, 2023, and certain ongoing reporting obligations through April 1, 2023. While we believe that we are fully compliant with all requirements of the CARES Act and the Payroll Support Program Agreements, including the requirement to use the awards only for payment of certain employment costs (i.e. wages, salaries and benefits), if we were found to be not in compliance with such requirements, the Treasury has sole discretion to impose any remedy it deems appropriate, including requiring full repayment of the awards with appropriate interest. The imposition of any such remedy could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition. 
 The CARES Act also provides an Employee Retention Credit ERC program. The goal of the ERC program is to encourage employers to retain and continue paying employees during periods of pandemic-related reduction in business volume even if those employees are not actually working, and therefore, are not providing a service to the employer. Under the Act, eligible employers could take credits up to 70 of qualified wages with a limit of 7 thousand per employee per quarter for the first three quarters of calendar year 2021. In order to qualify for the ERC in 2021, organizations generally have to experience a more than 20 decrease in gross receipts in the quarter compared to the same quarter in calendar year 2019 or its operations are fully or partially suspended during a calendar quarter due to orders from an appropriate governmental authority limiting commerce, travel, or group meetings (for commercial, social, religious, or other purposes) due to COVID-19. The credit is taken against our share of Social Security Tax when our payroll provider files, or subsequently amends the applicable quarterly employer tax filings. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had applied for 9.5 million and received 9.0 million of ERC. Our legal counsel has issued a legal opinion that we, more likely than not, qualified for the ERC. However, it remains uncertain whether we meet the qualifications required to receive the ERC. Therefore, the balance was included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets should we be required to potentially repay the ERC. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to our results of operations below, we report certain key financial measures that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. 
 These non-GAAP financial measures are an addition, and not a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to any performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures of financial results provide useful supplemental information to investors about us. However, there are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-GAAP financial measures and their nearest GAAP equivalents, including that they exclude significant expenses that are required by GAAP to be recorded in our financial measures. In addition, other companies may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to calculate their financial performance, and therefore, our non-GAAP financial measures might not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted for (i) interest income (expense), (ii) income tax expense, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) equity-based compensation, (v) dividends from redeemable preferred stock, (vi) public company readiness expenses, (vii) non-cash loss on assets held for sale, which represents the impairment charges recognized on assets designated for sale prior to their disposal, (viii) realized losses on aircraft sold as part of fleet modernization efforts, (ix) gain on forgiveness of CARES Act Loan, (x) change in fair value of derivative liability, and (xi) change in fair value of warrant liabilities. 
 We include Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure for assessing operating performance in conjunction with related GAAP amounts and for the following : 
 50 

Strategic internal planning, annual budgeting, allocating resources and making operating decisions. 
 Historical period-to-period comparisons of our business, as it removes the effect of certain non-cash expenses and expenses and revenue unrelated to our core ongoing business. 
 The following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP measure (in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net loss (84,980) (30,451) Add (deduct): Interest income (3,419) (2,989) Interest expense 15,940 15,601 Income tax benefit Depreciation and amortization 19,283 20,176 Equity-based Compensation Dividends from redeemable preferred stock 2,708 Public company readiness expenses (1)

 1,312 Gain on forgiveness of CARES Act Loan (339) Change in fair value of derivative liability 3,577 Change in fair value of warrant liabilities 2,179 Adjusted EBITDA (45,746) 13,081 
 (1) Includes costs primarily associated with compliance and consulting in advance of LGM Enterprises transitioning to a public company as a result of the Merger. 
 (2) Represents losses incurred on sales of aircraft that the Company previously identified as part of our fleet modernization efforts that are outside of the normal course of business. 
 Key Operating Metrics 
 In addition to financial measures, we regularly review certain key operating metrics to evaluate our business, determine the allocation of resources and make decisions regarding business strategies. We believe that these metrics can be useful for understanding the underlying trends in our business. Pursuant to the Volato Agreement, effective September 1, 2024, the Company operated certain legacy Volato aircraft under the Volato certificate. The Company also provided services to Volato legacy members and fractional owners. As a result, we have included the aircraft on Volato's certificate, hours flown on those aircraft, and the members and fractional owners in the operating metrics below for completeness. 
 The following table summarizes our key operating metrics:

 Members contributing to revenues are defined as the number of contractual retail members - club, fractional, and partnership members - that contributed to revenues during the reporting period. GRP customers do not represent contractual retail, and thus are not considered members . 
 The Company s historical flight hours for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, without flight hours derived from GRP were as follows: 48,862 hours for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 32,706 hours for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The Company s historical hours per aircraft for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, without flight hours derived from GRP were as follows: 468 hours per aircraft for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 348 hours per aircraft for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Members contributing to revenues 
 We define members contributing to revenues as the number of club, fractional, and partnership members that contributed to revenues during the reporting period. We believe that membership growth is strategically correlated to aircraft additions, and the evolution of our business from non-contractual wholesale customers prior to 2020 to contractually committed members, which provides greater revenue visibility. Due to the nature of our business, we have periods of time in which not every member utilizes our services. 
 Active Members 
 We define active members as members that have taken at least one flight during the reporting period. 
 Average aircraft on certificate 
 We define average aircraft on certificate as the average number of airworthy aircraft in our fleet as certified by the Federal Aviation Administration FAA deeming the aircraft operational. We believe that our growth has been fueled by a disciplined, strategic approach to adding aircraft, either via fractional or whole ownership or via lease from a third party. The time between the purchase or lease of an aircraft and the aircraft s certification is critical because revenue cannot be earned on the aircraft until it is certified by the FAA. Thus, we use average aircraft on certificate as a key operating metric within a given reporting period. 
 Ending aircraft on certificate 
 We define ending aircraft on certificate as the number of airworthy aircraft in our fleet as certified by the FAA at the end of a given reporting period. We use ending aircraft on certificate to measure fleet growth in comparison to historical periods. 
 Aircraft contributing to revenues 
 We define aircraft contributing to revenues as the number of aircraft on certificate that completed a customer flight leg during the reporting period. Aircraft contributing to revenues during a given reporting period is lower than the number of aircraft on certificate due to unavailable aircraft resulting from maintenance and/or refurbishment. 
 Total flight hours 
 We define total flight hours as the actual flight time from the moment of aircraft lift-off at the departure airport until it touches ground at the end of a flight. We believe total flight hours are a useful metric to measure the usage of our programs and the scale of our fleet and revenue growth. 
 52 

Total hours per aircraft 
 We define total hours per aircraft as the total flight hours divided by the average number of aircraft on our operating certificates during the reporting period. We use total hours per aircraft to assess operational efficiency as it pertains to aircraft utilization and mitigation of downtime, which can result from maintenance and/or crew availability. 
 Members per aircraft 
 We define members per aircraft as members contributing to revenues divided by aircraft contributing to revenues. We use members per aircraft to control the customer experience through the management of our customer to aircraft ratio. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 98.8 of our customers were fulfilled on our fleet without the potential high-cost of reliance of third parties to meet demand. An optimal customer to aircraft ratio allows us to gain a competitive advantage by having sufficient aircraft available to meet member demand and be flexible to backfill unused aircraft for wholesale use. 
 
 Components of Results of Our Operations 
 The key components of our results of operations include: 
 Revenue 
 We derive revenue from charter flights, which include our jet club, GRP (until June 30, 2023), fractional programs, wholesale, and retail. We also derive revenue from our MRO services and management fees related to the Volato Agreement. 
 Customers prepay us in advance for member flights based on contractual rates depending on the type of flight. We then recognize revenue from these prepayments upon completion of a flight. 
 Jet club members pay an initial non-refundable flight deposit where the amount of the flight deposit impacts the contractual rates paid. We recognize this kind of revenue and membership fees monthly as the Company stands ready to provide flight services as requested by the customer, thereby satisfying our related performance obligation. 
 Revenue for flights and related services is recognized when such services are provided to the customers. Fluctuations in revenue during any given period in the flights and related services portion of our jet club program are directly correlated to customer demand. 
 We derive GRP revenue from contracts with wholesale customers whereby the customer commits to purchase a specified minimum number of hours per quarter in exchange for guaranteed access to specific aircraft. The customer pays daily and hourly rates depending upon aircraft type as well as other incidental fees. Although the customer is committed to a minimum number of flight hours per aircraft and a minimum number of aircraft, actual GRP revenue is highly variable as the customer controls the timing, frequency and total volume of usage, sometimes resulting in significant revenue above or below the contractual minimum. We recognize the monthly minimum as revenue ratably over time and any variable consideration generated from flight services above the minimum in the period of performance. We received no GRP revenue after June 30, 2023 due to the termination of the GRP Agreement. 
 We recognize fractional revenue from the sales of fractional ownership interests in aircraft over the term of the agreement. In certain contracts the customer can require us to repurchase the interest after a fixed period of time but prior to the contractual termination date of the contract. This is accounted for as a right of return. The consideration from the fractional ownership interest, as adjusted for any customer right of return, is recognized over the term of the contract on a straight-line basis. Variable consideration generated from flight services is recognized in the period of performance. 
 MRO services are comprised of a single performance obligation for aircraft maintenance services such as modifications, repairs and inspections. MRO revenue is recognized over time based on the cost of parts and supplies consumed and labor hours worked for each service provided. Any billing for MRO services that exceeds revenue earned to date is included in deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 53 

Costs and expenses 
 Cost of revenue 
 Cost of revenue primarily consists of direct expenses incurred to provide flight services and facilitate operations, including aircraft lease costs, fuel, payroll expenses including wages and employee benefits for employees directly providing and facilitating flight services, crew travel, insurance, maintenance, subscriptions, and third-party flight costs. 
 Selling, general and administrative 
 Selling, general and administrative expense primarily consists of non-flight related employee compensation wages and benefits in our finance, executive, human resources, legal and other administrative functions, employee training, third-party professional fees, corporate travel, advertising, and corporate related lease expenses. 
 Depreciation and amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization expense primarily consists of depreciation of capitalized aircraft. Depreciation and amortization also includes amortization of capitalized software development costs. 
 Loss (gain) on aircraft held for sale 
 Consists of aircraft sales in excess (gain) or below (loss) their net book value, in addition to the recognized (loss) on aircraft classified as held for sale where the fair value less costs to sell are below (loss) their net book value. 
 Other income (expense) 
 Interest income 
 Interest income consists of interest earned on municipal bond funds and U.S. Treasury bills. 
 Interest expense 
 Interest expense primarily consists of interest paid or payable and the amortization of debt discounts and deferred financing costs on our loans. 
 Change in fair value of derivative liability

 55 

GRP revenue decreased by 66.9 million, or 100 , to 0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due to the termination of the WUP agreement that occurred on June 30, 2023, resulting in no GRP revenue during 2024. 
 Fractional ownership revenue increased by 10.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to fractional membership growth. 
 Maintenance, repair, and overhaul revenue increased by 2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to an increase in external services for outside customers. 
 Aircraft management services revenue increased by 0.6 million, or 100 , from 0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to the Company providing certain aircraft management services for third-party aircraft owners under the Volato Agreement. 
 We expect our revenue to increase over time as a result of adding aircraft to our fleet and forecasted membership growth.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources and Uses of Liquidity 
 Our principal sources of liquidity have historically consisted of financing activities, including proceeds from equity sales and notes payable, and operating activities, primarily from the increase in deferred revenue associated with prepaid flights. As of September 30, 2024, we had 18.7 million of cash and cash equivalents, 61.4 million in short-term investments in securities and 8.9 million available borrowing capacity under the 2018 Term Loan. As of September 30, 2024, we had 0.5 million of available borrowing capacity under the 2023 Revolving Line of Credit. Our cash equivalents primarily consist of liquid money market funds, and our investments primarily consist of fixed-income securities including corporate bonds, government bonds, municipal issues, and U.S. Treasury bills. 
 We have consistently maintained a working capital deficit, in which our current liabilities exceed our current assets. We believe the working capital deficit is common within the private aviation industry and is primarily, but not wholly, due to the nature of our deferred revenue, primarily related to prepaid flights, which are performance obligations generally for future flights. Our primary needs for liquidity are to fund working capital, debt service requirements, lease and purchase obligations, capital expenditures, and for general corporate purposes. Our cash needs vary from period to period, primarily based on the timing of aircraft purchases and the costs of aircraft engine overhauls, repairs, and maintenance. 
 We believe factors that could affect our liquidity include our rate of revenue growth, changes in demand for our services, competitive pricing pressures, other growth initiatives, our ability to keep increases in operating expenses in line with growth in revenues, and overall economic conditions. In addition, because of the current disparity between the 11.50 per share exercise price of our outstanding Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants and the current trading price of the Class A Common Stock, which closed on November 1, 2024, at 2.10 per share, we are unlikely to receive significant proceeds from the exercise of warrants in the near term. To the extent that our current liquidity is insufficient to fund future activities, we would need to raise additional funds. In the future, we may attempt to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities or through debt financing arrangements. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, the ownership of existing shareholders will be diluted. The incurrence of additional debt financing might be restricted or prohibited by the terms of our current or future debt obligations and would result in debt service obligations, and any such debt could include operating and financing covenants that could restrict our operations. In the event that additional funds are required from outside sources, we might not be able to raise funds on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to source external financing, we could be forced to delay, reduce, suspend or cease our working capital requirements, capital expenditures and business development efforts, which would have a negative impact on our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. 
 We believe that our existing cash on hand, cash generated from operations and available borrowings under our debt arrangement will enable us to secure refinancing as needed to meet our obligations as they become due within the next 12 months. If we are not able to refinance, our liquidity and business would be materially adversely impacted. 
 Cash Requirements 
 Our material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations: 
 Debt 
 See Note 16 "Debt" to our financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for further information on the debt arrangements discussed below. 
 Short Term Notes Payable 
 We have entered into multiple short-term loan agreements with various lenders for the purpose of financing the purchase of aircraft. The loan agreements have varying interest rates, maturity dates and-lender imposed restrictions. 
 60 

Credit Facility (Term Loan) 
 In August 2018, we entered into a term loan agreement with a maximum borrowing capacity of 12.3 million. We have since entered into amended term loan agreements, which raised the maximum borrowing capacity to 15.3 million, of which we had borrowed 6.3 million as of September 30, 2024. In August 2024, there were two payoffs of sub-notes totaling 4.3 million. 
 The current iteration of the term loan agreement matured September 2024 and allows the option to elect an interest rate equal to the SOFR-Based Rate or the Prime-Based Rate. Maturity of the term loan agreement does not affect the existing debt, but precludes the ability to originate new debt under the agreement. We are exploring renewal of the term loan agreement under a new covenant structure. 
 Credit Facility (Revolving Line of Credit) 
 In March 2023, the Company entered into a revolving uncommitted line of credit loan (the Master Note ). The Master Note provides a line of credit of up to 60.0 million. At the Company s option, the annual interest rate on term loans drawn from the Master Note is equal to either the Prime-Based Rate, defined as the greater of 1.25 or the prime rate minus 1.88 , or the Daily Simple SOFR-Based Rate, defined as the greater of 1.25 or the Daily Simple SOFR plus 1.25 . On March 9, 2024, we entered into an amendment to extend the maturity date of the Master Note from March 9, 2024 to September 9, 2025. 
 We drew an initial 44.5 million principal amount in March 2023, with the selected interest option of SOFR plus 1.25 . In April, September and October 2023, we drew additional 3.3 million, 8.7 million and 3.0 million principal amounts, respectively, under the Master Note with the selected interest option of SOFR plus 1.25 . 
 Senior Secured Notes 
 In December 2023, we issued 15.7 million in principal amount of senior secured notes due in December 2024 in a private offering. The notes were issued with a stated rate of 14 and interest is payable monthly in arrears. The senior secured notes will mature one year from closing date, in which the full principal amount will be due, along with any accrued unpaid interest. The Company will use the proceeds from the issuance to fund aircraft purchases. 
 Long-Term Loan Agreement 
 In connection with the acquisition of a new aircraft in February 2024, the Company entered into a long-term promissory note agreement with a principal amount of of 4.2 million. The note bears a fixed interest rate of 7.25 and has a maturity date five years from the note agreement date. 
 In March 2024, the Company entered into a long-term promissory note agreement with a principal amount of 13.9 million. The note bears a fixed interest rate of 9.45 and has a maturity date ten years from the note agreement date. 
 In April 2024, the Company entered into an amendment of a short-term promissory note agreement, to extend the maturity date to a long-term promissory note maturing in April 2025 with a principal amount of 7.8 million. The note bears a fixed interest rate of 7.75 and has a maturity date five years from the note amendment. 
 In May 2024, the Company entered into a long-term promissory note agreement with a principal amount of 12.6 million. The note bears a fixed interest rate of 8.81 and has a maturity date five years from the note agreement date. 
 January 2024 Senior Secured Note

Leases 
 We have entered into various lease arrangements for vehicles, hangars, office space and aircraft. In addition to leases of aircraft, we are obligated to pay into aircraft reserve programs. 
 The duration of our leases varies from two to 30 years, and the leases are generally operating leases. Our vehicle leases are typically month-to-month and are classified as short-term leases. 
 See Note 17 "Leases" to our financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for further detail of our lease arrangements. 
 Short-Term Expenditures 
 We currently anticipate that cash required for expenditures for the next 12 months is approximately 177.4 million, which includes accounts payable of 26.1 million, accrued expenses and other current liabilities of 26.7 million, short-term notes payable of 28.5 million, the current portion of long-term debt contractual principal payments due of 81.4 million and lease payments of 14.7 million. We plan to refinance contractual principal payments that comprise the short-term debt liability as they become due. As stated above, we have maintained a positive relationship with our debtholders and have not historically had any difficulty refinancing our debt obligations. Based on our historical experience and the fact that we have not suffered any decline in creditworthiness, we expect that our cash on hand and cash earnings will enable us to secure the necessary refinancing. The accounts payable, accrued expenses, and lease liabilities will be settled using a combination of cash generated by operations, sale of investments and incremental borrowing activity, if necessary. 
 Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those set forth in Item 1A, "Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business and Industry." as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

from prepaid expenses and other current assets, partially offset by a 37.5 million cash outflow from customer deposits, a 11.1 million cash outflow from operating lease liabilities, and a 0.8 million decrease from parts and supplies inventory. 
 Net cash flows from investing activities 
 Net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 22.1 million, primarily due to proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of 28.5 million, proceeds from the sale of investments of 57.4 million, and the paydown of notes receivable of 15.0 million. Partially offsetting the increase in net cash provided by investing activities were purchases of property and equipment of 14.7 million, purchases of engine overhauls of 18.4 million, and purchases of investments of 45.5 million. 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 44.1 million primarily due to purchases of property and equipment of 67.0 million, purchases of engine overhauls of 14.5 million, and purchases of investments of 68.8 million.

Partially offsetting the increase in net cash provided by financing activities was repayment of debt of 50.3 million, payment of debt issuance costs of 4.0 million, and net cash distributions to noncontrolling interests of 7.6 million. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 27.6 million primarily resulting from proceeds from debt of 97.8 million, million, partially offset by repayments of debt of 32.5 million, repayments of deferred financing costs of 1.5 million and net cash distributions to members and noncontrolling interests of 36.2 million. 
 
 Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies 
 Our principal commitments consist of contractual cash obligations under our borrowings with banks, and operating leases for certain controlled aircraft, corporate headquarters, and operational facilities, including aircraft hangars. Our obligations under our borrowing arrangements are described in Note 16 "Debt" and for further information on our leases, see Note 17 "Leases" of the accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report. 
 From time to time, we are involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. We believe that we have meritorious arguments in our current litigation matters and that any outcome, either individually or in the aggregate, will not be material to our financial position or results of operations. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 There have been no significant changes to the Company's critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with those disclosed within Part II, Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, aside from those included below: 
 Public Warrants, Private Warrants and Penny Warrants 
 As of September 30, 2024 the Company has the following warrants issued, (i) the Public Warrants initially included in the EGA units issued in EGA's initial public offering, (ii) the warrants of EGA held by EG Sponsor LLC (the EGA Sponsor that were issued to the EGA Sponsor at the closing of EGA's initial public offering (the "Private Placement Warrants,"), (iii) warrants issued on March 4, 2024 in connection with the Series A Preferred Stock offering as described within Note 24 "Stockholders Equity / Members' Deficit and Noncontrolling Interests" (the "Series A Penny Warrants"), and (iv) warrants issued on August 8, 2024 and August 14, 2024 in connection with the Series B Preferred Stock offering as described within Note 24 "Stockholders' Equity/Members' Deficit and Noncontrolling Interests" (the "Series B Penny Warrants," together with the Series A Penny Warrants, the "Penny Warrants," and together with the Public Warrants, the Private Placement Warrants and the Series A Penny Warrants, the "Warrants"). 
 The Company determines the accounting classification of the Warrants as either liability or equity by first assessing whether the Warrants meet liability classification in accordance with ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 ). Under ASC 480, a financial instrument that embodies an unconditional obligation, or a financial instrument other than an outstanding share that embodies a conditional obligation, that the issuer must or may settle by issuing a 
 64 

variable number of its equity shares must be classified as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances) if, at inception, the monetary value of the obligation is based solely or predominantly on any one of the following: (a) a fixed monetary amount known at inception; (b) variations in something other than the fair value of the issuer s equity shares; or (c) variations inversely related to changes in the fair value of the issuer s equity shares. The Company determined that the Warrants should not be classified as liabilities under ASC 480. 
 If financial instruments, such as the Warrants, are not required to be classified as liabilities under ASC 480, the Company assesses whether such instruments are indexed to the Company's own stock under ASC 815-40. In order for an instrument to be considered indexed to an entity's own stock, its settlement amount must always equal the difference between the following: (a) the fair value of a fixed number of the Company's equity shares, and (b) a fixed monetary amount or a fixed amount of a debt instrument issued by the Company. As there are scenarios where the settlement amount would not equal the difference between the fair value of a fixed number of shares and a fixed monetary amount (or a fixed amount of a debt instrument), the Company determined that the Series A Penny Warrants, the Public Warrants, and the Private Placement Warrants were not indexed to the Company's own stock and therefore they must be classified as liabilities. The Company also determined that the Series A Penny Warrants, the Public Warrants, and the Private Placement Warrants met all criteria to meet the definition of a derivative under ASC 815- 10-15-83. For the Series B Penny Warrants, the Company determined that they were indexed to the Company's own stock and would be settled in shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock at an explicit share limit. As such, The Company concluded that the Series B Penny Warrants must be classified as permanent equity, and that the Series B Penny Warrants are not subject to remeasurement at each reporting date. 
 The Company recorded the Series A Penny Warrants, the Public Warrants, and the Private Placement Warrants as liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets (unaudited) at fair value, with subsequent changes in the fair value recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss (unaudited) at each reporting date. 
 Temporary Equity 
 The Company accounts for its common and preferred stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. Common and preferred stock subject to mandatory redemption (if any) is classified as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common and preferred stock (including common stock that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders equity. Our Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock (as defined within Note 24 "Stockholders Equity / Members' Deficit and Noncontrolling Interests") feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to the occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, 25,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and 25,510 shares of Series B Preferred Stock subject to possible redemption are presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders equity section of our balance sheets at September 30, 2024. 
 Aircraft Sales and Aircraft Held for sale 
 The Company occasionally sells aircraft held for use from its fleet. The (gain) or loss from each transaction is recognized upon completion of the sale as a Loss (gain) on aircraft held for sale on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss (unaudited). 
 Loss (gain) on aircraft held for sale consists of the (gain) or loss on aircraft previously held for use as property and equipment and subsequently elected to actively market for sale. When a decision is made to actively market for sale, depreciation is discontinued, and aircraft held for sale is recorded at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs to sell. We presented aircraft assets held for sale at the lower of their current carrying value or their fair market value less costs to sell. The fair values are based upon observable and unobservable inputs, including market trends and conditions. The assumptions used to determine the fair value of the assets held for sale are subject to inherent uncertainty and could produce a wide range of outcomes which the Company will continue to monitor in future periods as new information becomes available. Prior to the ultimate sale of the assets, subsequent changes in the estimate of the fair value of the assets held for sale will be recorded as a (gain) or loss with a corresponding adjustment to the assets carrying value. Impairment is included within Loss (gain) on aircraft held for sale within the loss from operations on the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss (unaudited).

Recently Issued/Adopted Accounting Standards 
 Refer to the sections titled "Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements" and Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted in Note 2 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements (unaudited) included in this Report. 
 
 JOBS Act Accounting Election 
 In April 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for an emerging growth company. We have elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date that we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, our audited financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with the new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. 
 We have chosen to rely on the other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as an emerging growth company we are not required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of SOX, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the consolidated financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis) and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation-related items, such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executive officer s compensation to median employee compensation. We may remain an emerging growth company until the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering. However, if certain events occur prior to the end of such five-year period, including if we become a large accelerated filer, our annual gross revenue equals or exceeds 1.07 billion or we issue more than 1.0 billion of non-convertible debt in any three-year period, we will cease to be an emerging growth company prior to the end of such five-year period. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 In the ordinary course of operating our business, we are exposed to market risks. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position or results of operations due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our principal market risks are related to interest rates and aircraft fuel costs. There have not been any material changes to the market risks described in Part II, Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company s management, with the participation of its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 66 

Based on their evaluation, we concluded that, at the end of the period covered by this Report, our disclosure of controls and procedures were not effective due to material weaknesses in the Company s internal control over financial reporting as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Except for the continuing remediation efforts previously reported in Part II, Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 67

The Company issued 20,408 shares of Series B Preferred Stock and a Series B Penny Warrant to purchase up to 4,000,000 shares of Common Stock to EnTrust on the Initial Closing Date and received gross proceeds of approximately 20.4 million. Pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, on August 14, 2024 (the Subsequent Closing Date ), the Company (i) issued the remaining 5,102 shares of Series B Preferred Stock and a Series B Penny Warrant to purchase up to 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock to EG Sponsor and (ii) received additional gross proceeds of approximately 5.1 million on the Subsequent Closing Date. Gregg S. Hymowitz, a member of the Company s Board of Directors, to which position he was designated by an affiliate of the Purchaser, serves as the Founder and Chief Executive Officer of EnTrust Global Partners LLC EnTrust Global ), which is an affiliate of the Preferred Purchaser and may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of approximately 21.0 of the Company s outstanding Common Stock.
