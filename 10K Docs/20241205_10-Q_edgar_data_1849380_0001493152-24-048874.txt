NOTES
TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

million and million for the three months ended March
31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In addition, the Company had an accumulated deficit of million as of March 31, 2024. The Company s
cash balance of million is not adequate to fund its operations through at least twelve months from the date these condensed consolidated
financial statements were available for issuance. Therefore, these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern. 

To
continue in existence and expand its operations, the Company will be required to, and management plans to, raise additional working capital
through an equity or debt offering and ultimately hopes to attain profitable operations to fulfill its operating and capital requirements
for at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of the condensed consolidated financial statements. However, the Company may not
be able to secure such financing in a timely manner or on favorable terms, if at all. Furthermore, if the Company issues equity securities
to raise additional funds, its existing stockholders may experience dilution, and the new equity securities may have rights, preferences
and privileges senior to those of the Company s existing stockholders. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should the Company
be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to continue
receiving working capital cash payments and generating cash flow from operations. 

Risks
and uncertainties 

The
Company is subject to risks common to companies in the markets it serves, including, but not limited to, global economic and financial
market conditions, fluctuations in customer demand, acceptance of new products, development by its competitors of new technological innovations,
dependence on key personnel, and protection of proprietary technology. 

Segment
information 

The
Company operates in one operating segment and, accordingly, no segment disclosures have been presented herein.

of the transaction. These shares are considered treasury stock, which is a reduction to stockholders equity. Treasury stock is
included in authorized and issued shares but excluded from outstanding shares. 

or 
annually from the date of issuance until the outstanding principal was paid or converted. In connection with the issuance of
Convertible Promissory Notes in 2022 and 2023, the Company also issued warrants at an exercise price of 
per share (the Convertible Promissory Notes Warrants ). See additional information on the accounting for the warrants
in Note 9. 

The
Convertible Promissory Notes were issued for general working capital purposes. The Company elected the fair value option FVO of accounting under ASC 825, Financial Instruments , for its Convertible Promissory Notes. Under the FVO election, the financial
instrument is initially measured at its issue-date estimated fair value and subsequently remeasured at estimated fair value on a recurring
basis at each reporting period date. The estimated fair value adjustment is presented as a single line item within other (income) expenses,
net in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations under the caption change in fair value of convertible debt. 

In
November 2023, all Convertible Promissory Notes were converted pursuant to their provision in connection with the Business Combination
between Data Knights and Legacy ONMD and were no longer outstanding as of December 31, 2023. See the Form 10-K/A for all other details
relating to the Convertible Promissory Notes issued prior to December 31, 2023. 

PIPE
Notes 

On
June 28, 2023, The PIPE Notes mature on the first anniversary
of the issuance date, or November 7, 2024. 

The
Company elected the FVO of accounting for its PIPE Notes. The estimated fair value adjustment is presented as a single line item within
other (income) expenses, net in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations under the caption change in fair value
of PIPE Notes. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of the PIPE Notes was million, which is included in current
liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

Shareholder
Loans 

In
January 2024, the Company received gross proceeds of million in connection with a shareholder loan with a related party investor
which is convertible into shares of Common Stock at a conversion price of per share. The balance of million is
included in loan, related party on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2024. 

Helena
Notes 

On
March 28, 2024, the Company entered into a definitive securities purchase agreement (the Helena
SPA with Helena Global Investment Opportunities 1 Ltd. Helena ), an affiliate of Helena Partners Inc., a Cayman-Islands
based advisor and investor providing for up to million in funding through a private
placement for the issuance of senior secured convertible notes and warrants across multiple tranches. The Helena SPA was subsequently
terminated in June 2024 prior to the closing of any tranches (the Helena Termination Agreement ). As such, the Helena SPA
had no impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the period ended March 31, 2024. 

Pursuant
to the Helena Termination Agreement, the Company issued to Helena a warrant to purchase shares of Common Stock at an exercise
price of per share and agreed to reimburse Helena for certain reasonable and documented out-of-pocket legal fees and expenses incurred
in connection with entry into the Helena SPA and Helena Termination Agreement and related documents.

by the Government of Canada to provide capital to organizations to see them through the challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic and
better position them to return to providing services and creating employment. The loan is unsecured. The loan was interest free through
December 31, 2023. If the loan was paid back by January 18, 2024, thousand of the loan would have been forgiven. If the loan was
not paid back by January 18, 2024, the full thousand loan would have been converted to a loan repayable over with a 
interest rate. The loan was paid back prior to January 18, 2024, and the Company recognized a gain on extinguishment of thousand,

2024.

five trading days prior to the six-month anniversary, the aggregate VWAP value of the shares of Common Stock was lower than the
original share value of million, the In January 2024, the Company
issued the original shares of Common Stock as consideration for million owed by the Company. As of March 31, 2024, the The promissory note remained unpaid upon maturity on , and the Company recorded interest
expense of thousand during the three months ended March 31, 2024, because of the event of default. In August 2024, the Company made
a promissory note payment of million. 

In
February 2024, the Company entered into a stock repurchase agreement with a former holder of Convertible Promissory Notes pursuant to
which the Company repurchased shares of Common Stock in exchange for cash of million that is payable in installments. The
Company made payments of million in July and October 2024 and the remaining million is expected to be repaid in early 2025.
The million represents the principal and accrued interest outstanding on the holder s Convertible Promissory Note immediately
prior to the Business Combination. The million outstanding at March 31, 2024 is classified in accounts payable and accrued expenses
on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The repurchased shares were reclassified to treasury stock as of March 31, 2024.

Convertible
Promissory Notes Warrants 

As
described in Note 3, the Company issued Convertible Promissory Notes Warrants in 2022 and 2023. The Convertible Promissory Notes
Warrants are classified as equity in accordance with ASC subtopic 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity s
Own Equity ASC 815-40 ). The Company determined that the fair value of the combined instrument (inclusive of the
Convertible Promissory Notes) significantly exceeds the proceeds received; therefore, the Company concluded that the Convertible Promissory Notes Warrants are
most accurately portrayed as an issuance cost related to the Convertible Promissory Notes. This resulted in an expense of 
million being allocated to the Convertible Promissory Notes Warrants during the three months ended March 31, 2023, which is
classified as stock warrant expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

In
connection with the closing of the Business Combination on November 7, 2023, all Convertible Promissory Notes Warrants were cashless
exercised into shares of Legacy ONMD common stock and exchanged based on the appropriate conversion ratio for the Common Stock less an

to December 31, 2023. 

PIPE
Warrants 

In
conjunction with the issuance of the PIPE Notes described in Note 3, Data Knights also issued and sold to each of the Purchasers 
warrants to purchase Common Stock at an exercise price of per share (the PIPE Warrants ). The PIPE Warrants are classified
as liabilities because they did not meet the criteria for equity treatment under ASC 815-40. During the three months ended March 31,
2024, the Company recognized a change in fair value of PIPE Warrants of thousand. 

Private
Placement Warrants 

In
connection with the closing of the Business Combination on November 7, 2023, the Company assumed private warrants to purchase
Common Stock at an exercise price of per share (the Private Placement Warrants ). The Private Placement Warrants
are classified as liabilities because they did not meet the criteria for equity treatment under ASC 815-40. During the three months ended
March 31, 2024, the Company recognized a change in fair value of Private Placement Warrants of thousand.

Placement Warrants and PIPE Warrants 

The
aggregate fair value of the Private Placement Warrants and PIPE Warrants was thousand and thousand as of March 31, 2024 and December
31, 2023, respectively. The Company remeasured the fair value of the Private Placement Warrants and PIPE Warrants at March 31, 2024 using
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:

PIPE
Notes 

The
estimated fair values of the PIPE Notes are determined based on the aggregated, probability-weighted average of the outcomes of certain
possible scenarios. The combined value of the probability-weighted average of those outcomes is then discounted back to each reporting
period in which the convertible notes are outstanding, in each case, based on a risk-adjusted discount rate estimated based on the implied
discount rate. The discount rate was held constant over the valuation periods given the fact pattern associated with the company and
the stage of development. 

The
fair value of the PIPE Notes was million as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Convertible
Promissory Notes and Warrants 

As
described in Note 3, the Company issued various Convertible Promissory Notes to related party investors. Total gross proceeds raised

of the Convertible Promissory Notes, the Company also issued Convertible Promissory Notes Warrants to purchase shares of Legacy
ONMD common stock to the same related parties (out of total). The closing of the Business Combination triggered the conversion

Standby
Equity Purchase Agreement 

On
June 17, 2024, the Company entered into a standby equity purchase agreement (the SEPA with YA II PN, LTD, a Cayman Islands
exempt limited partnership managed by Yorkville Advisors Global, LP Yorkville ). Pursuant to the SEPA, subject to certain
conditions, the Company has the option to sell to Yorkville an aggregate amount of up to million of shares of Common Stock at the
Company s request from time to time following both the repayment of the Yorkville Promissory Note described below and the effectiveness
of a resale registration statement covering the shares of Common Stock issued under the SEPA. The SEPA terminates on its 24-month anniversary. 

Any
purchase under an advance would be subject to certain limitations, including that Yorkville will not purchase or acquire any shares that
would result in it and its affiliates beneficially owning more than of the then outstanding voting power or number of shares of
Common Stock or any shares that when aggregated with shares issued under all other earlier advances, would exceed shares of
Common Stock (representing of the aggregate number of then outstanding shares of Common Stock) (the Exchange Cap unless shareholders approved issuances in excess of the Exchange Cap. 

In
connection with the execution of the SEPA, the Company paid a structuring fee to Yorkville. The Company agreed to pay a commitment
fee of million to Yorkville, which was payable in shares. In September 2024, the Company issued shares of Common Stock to
Yorkville to settle the commitment fee. 

Additionally,
Yorkville agreed to advance to the Company, in exchange for a convertible promissory note (the Yorkville Promissory Note ),
a principal amount of million, which was funded on June 18, 2024. The Floor Price is per share, subject to the Company s option
to reduce the Floor Price to any amount set forth in a written notice to Yorkville. While the Yorkville Promissory Note is outstanding,
Yorkville may initiate an investor advance under the SEPA at the Yorkville Promissory Note conversion price, the proceeds of which would
be used to repay the Yorkville Promissory Note. 

The
Yorkville Promissory Note may be accelerated by Yorkville upon specified events of default, and may become amortizable for cash if (i)
the daily VWAP is less than the Floor Price for five trading days during a period of seven consecutive trading days, (ii) the Company
has issued in excess of 95 of the shares of Common Stock available under the Exchange Cap or (iii) the Company is in material breach
of its obligations under a registration rights agreement it entered into with Yorkville in connection with the SEPA or Yorkville becomes
limited in its ability to freely resell shares subject to an advance as further described in the Yorkville Promissory Note, subject to
de-amortization after certain cures. 

Yorkville
Letter 

On
October 8, 2024, Yorkville sent the Company a letter notifying the Company that it had breached a registration rights agreement with
Yorkville by failing to file a Registration Statement on Form S-1 on the timeline set forth in the registration rights agreement (the
 Yorkville Letter ). The Yorkville Letter asserted that this breach was an event of default and an amortization event under
the prepaid advance in connection with the SEPA. The Yorkville Letter also asserted that the Company s failure to timely file its
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2024 was an event of default under the Yorkville Promissory Note.
The Company subsequently engaged in discussions with Yorkville regarding the Yorkville Letter, which discussions are ongoing. 

Pursuant
to the Yorkville Promissory Note, upon the occurrence of an amortization event, the Company is required to pay all principal and accrued
interest on the Yorkville Promissory Note, plus a 10 payment premium on the principal amount, in equal installments over 3 calendar
months or until the amortization event is cured, whichever is earlier. In addition, upon the occurrence of an event of default, the interest
rate on the Yorkville Promissory Note increases to 18 retroactive to the date of the event of default.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The
following discussion and analysis are intended to help you understand our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity,
and capital resources. You should read this discussion in conjunction with the Company s consolidated financial statements and
related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Report and in the Form 10-K/A. 

In
addition to historical financial analysis, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations
that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, as described under the heading Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements. 
Actual results and timing of selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result
of various factors, risks and uncertainties, including those set forth under Risk Factors included elsewhere (or incorporated
by reference) in this Report and in the Form 10-K/A. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to OneMedNet , we , us ,
 our, and the Company are intended to mean the business and operations of OneMedNet Corporation and its consolidated
subsidiary following the Business Combination. 

Company
Overview 

OneMedNet
Corporation is a healthcare software company with solutions focused on digital medical image management, exchange, and sharing. The Company
was founded in Delaware on November 20, 2015. The Company has been solely focused on creating solutions that simplify digital medical
image management, exchange, and sharing. The Company has one wholly-owned subsidiary, OneMedNet Technologies (Canada) Inc., incorporated
on October 16, 2015 under the provisions of the Business Corporations Act of British Columbia whose functional currency is the Canadian
dollar. The Company s headquarters location is Eden Prairie, Minnesota. 

Business
Combination 

On
November 7, 2023, we held the closing of the Business Combination whereby Merger Sub merged with and into Legacy ONMD, with Legacy ONMD
continuing as the surviving entity, which resulted in all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Legacy ONMD being exchanged
for shares of Common Stock upon the terms set forth in the agreement and plan of merger, dated April 25, 2022 (the Merger Agreement ),
by and among Data Knights, Merger Sub, Legacy ONMD, Data Knights, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the Sponsor ),
and Paul Casey, in his capacity as representative of the stockholders of Legacy ONMD. The Business Combination and other transactions
that closed on November 7, 2023, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, led to Data Knights changing its name to OneMedNet Corporation 
and the business of the Company became the business of Legacy ONMD. 

Pursuant
to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the total consideration for the Business Combination and related transactions (the Merger
Consideration was approximately 200 million. In connection with the special meeting of stockholders of Data Knights, certain
public holders holding 1,600,741 shares of Data Knights common stock exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion
of the funds held by Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company, as trustee in the trust account established in connection with Data
Knights initial public offering. Effective November 7, 2023, Data Knights units ceased trading, and effective November
8, 2023, the Common Stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol ONMD and the Public Warrants began
trading on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol ONMDW. The Common Stock and Public Warrants were transferred from
The Nasdaq Global Market to The Nasdaq Capital Market at the opening of business on August 19, 2024, and continue to trade under the
symbols ONMD and ONMDW, respectively. 

As
a result of the Business Combination, holders of Data Knights common stock automatically received Common Stock of OneMedNet, and holders
of Data Knights warrants automatically received warrants of OneMedNet with substantively identical terms. At the closing of the Business
Combination, all shares of Data Knights owned by the Sponsor (consisting of shares of Data Knights common stock and shares of Data Knights
Class B common stock), automatically converted into an equal number of shares of OneMedNet s Common Stock, and the private placement
warrants held by the Sponsor automatically converted into warrants to purchase one share of OneMedNet Common Stock with substantively
identical terms.

Key
Components of Consolidated Statements of Operations 

Revenue 

The
Company generates revenue from two streams: (1) iRWD, which provides regulatory grade imaging and clinical data in the pharmaceutical,
device manufacturing, contract research organizations, and AI markets and (2) BEAM, which is a medical imaging exchange platform between
hospital/healthcare systems, imaging centers, physicians and patients. iRWD is sold on a fixed fee basis based on the number of data
units and the cost per data unit committed to in the customer contract. Revenue is recognized when the data is delivered to the customer.
BEAM revenue is subscription-based revenue that is recognized ratably over the subscription period committed to by the customer. The
Company invoices its BEAM customers quarterly or annually in advance with the customer contracts automatically renewing unless the customer
issues a cancellation notice. 

The
Company excludes from revenue taxes collected from a customer that are assessed by a governmental authority and imposed on and concurrent
with a specific revenue-producing transaction. The transaction price for the products is the invoiced amount. Advanced billings from
contracts are deferred and recognized as revenue when earned. Deferred revenue consists of payments received in advance of performance
under the contract. Such amounts are generally recognized as revenue over the contractual period. The Company receives payments from
customers based upon contractual billing schedules. Accounts receivable is recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional.
Payment terms on invoiced amounts typically range from zero to 90 days, with typical terms of 30 days. 

Cost
of Revenue 

Our
cost of revenue is composed of our distinct performance obligations of hosting, labor, and data cost. 

General
and Administrative 

General
and administrative functions include finance, legal, human resources, operations, and information technology support. These functions
include costs for items such as salaries and benefits and other personnel-related costs, maintenance and supplies, professional fees
for external legal, accounting, and other consulting services, and depreciation expense. 

Research
and Development 

Costs
incurred in the research and development of our products are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs include personnel,
contracted services, materials, and indirect costs involved in the design and development of new products and services, as well as hosting
expense. 

Sales
and Marketing 

Our
sales and marketing costs consist of labor and tradeshow costs. 

Interest
Expense 

Interest
expense consists of interest incurred on shareholder loans. 

Other
(Income) Expenses, Net 

Other
(income) expenses, net, primarily includes the changes in fair value of convertible debt and change in fair value of PIPE Notes for which
we have elected the fair value option of accounting. Convertible notes payable, which include convertible promissory notes and PIPE Notes
issued to related parties, including accrued interest and contingently issuable warrants, contain embedded derivatives, including settlement
of the contingent conversion features, which require bifurcation and separate accounting. Accordingly, we have elected to measure the
entire contingently convertible debt instruments, including accrued interest, at fair value. These debt instruments were initially recorded
at fair value as liabilities and are subsequently re-measured at fair value on our condensed consolidated balance sheet at the end of
each reporting period and at settlement, as applicable. Other income or expenses, net, also includes changes in fair value of loan extensions,
deferred underwriting fees and warrants which are treated as liability instruments measured at fair value for accounting purposes, initially
recorded at fair value and subsequently re-measured to fair value on our condensed consolidated balance sheets at the end of each reporting
period. The changes in the fair value of these debt and liability instruments are recorded in changes in fair value, included as a component
of other (income) expenses, net, in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

At
the closing of the Business Combination, convertible promissory notes were converted into Common Stock immediately prior to the Closing
and were no longer outstanding as of the closing date. 

Other
(income) expenses, net, also includes foreign exchange and tax expenses related to the Company s operations and revenue outside
of the United States.

Our
revenue is comprised of sales made from our subscription revenue (BEAM) and from our web imaging (iRWD). For the three months ended March
31, 2024, overall revenue increased by 24 . The primary driver for the subscription revenue increase was delivery of revenue to a significant
customer. The primary driver for the increase in web imaging revenue was revenue deliveries pushed to the first quarter of 2024.

For
the three months ended March 31, 2024, we were able to reduce our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue by 17 . The decrease is
primarily driven by lower iRWD consulting costs during the three months ended March 31, 2024.

General
and Administrative 

Our
general and administrative expense increased 0.8 million, or 152 , to 1.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 from 0.5
million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase is primarily due to an increase in professional fees of 0.6 million
from being a public company, employee salaries and benefits of 0.1 million and bad debt expense of 0.1 million. 

Sales
and Marketing 

Our
sales marketing expense decreased 30 thousand, or 12 , to 229 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2024 from 259 thousand
for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in salaries and benefits of 84 thousand, which
is partially offset by increases in trade shows, dues and subscriptions and consultants, which collectively increased by 54 thousand. 

Research
and development 

Our
research and development expense decreased 0.1 million, or 24 , to 0.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 from 0.6
million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in stock compensation expense of 0.2
million, which is partially offset by an increase in salaries and benefits of 0.1 million. 

Interest
Expense 

During
the three months ended March 31, 2024, interest expense was primarily comprised of interest expense on loans made from related parties
(Management and Directors) and interest expense on 0.5 million of deferred underwriter fees payable in cash. During the three months
ended March 31, 2023, we did not incur any interest expense. 

Change
in Fair Value of Warrants 

The
change in fair value of Warrants was due to the closing of the Business Combination and the resulting fluctuations in the market price
of shares of Common Stock . 

Change
in Fair Value of PIPE Notes 

The
change in fair value of PIPE Notes was due to the closing of the Business Combination and the resulting fluctuations in the market price
of shares of Common Stock . 

Change
in Fair Value of Convertible Debt 

The
change in fair value of convertible debt was due to the closing of the Business Combination and the resulting fluctuations of the market
price of shares of Common Stock . The Convertible Promissory Notes were no longer outstanding during the three months ended March
31, 2024. 

Non-GAAP
Financial Measure 

In
addition to providing financial measurements based on U.S. GAAP, we provide an additional financial metric that is not prepared in
accordance with U.S. GAAP (a non-GAAP financial measure ). We use this non-GAAP financial measure, in addition to U.S.
GAAP financial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational
decision making, for planning and forecasting purposes, to measure executive compensation, and to evaluate our financial
performance. This non-GAAP financial measure is Adjusted EBITDA, as discussed below. 

We
believe that this non-GAAP financial measure reflects our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful comparisons and analysis
of trends in the business, as it facilitates comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies. We
also believe that this non-GAAP financial measure enables investors to evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same
manner as we do. This non-GAAP financial measure may exclude expenses and gains that may be unusual in nature, infrequent, or not reflective
of our ongoing operating results. 

This
non-GAAP financial measure should not be viewed as a substitute for a U.S. GAAP financial measure and may be different from a
similarly titled non-GAAP financial measure used by other companies. Furthermore, there are limitations inherent in the non-GAAP
financial measure because it excludes charges and credits that are required to be included in a U.S. GAAP presentation. Accordingly,
the non-GAAP financial measure does not replace the presentation of our U.S. GAAP financial measures and should only be used as a
supplement to, not as a substitute for, our financial results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. U.S. GAAP net loss is the
closest comparable U.S. GAAP measure used. 

18 

We
consider Adjusted EBITDA to be an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of our business and a good measure
of our historical operating trends. Adjusted EBITDA eliminates items that we do not consider to be part of our core operations. We
define Adjusted EBITDA as U.S. GAAP net loss excluding the following items: interest expense; income tax expense; depreciation and
amortization of tangible assets; stock-based compensation; Business Combination transaction expenses; and other non-recurring items
that may arise from time to time. 

The
non-GAAP adjustments, and our basis for excluding them from our non-GAAP financial measure, are outlined below: 

Adjusted
 EBITDA does not reflect interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service payments on our shareholder loans, which is
 not a core form of financing for our business; 

Adjusted
 EBITDA does not reflect income tax expense, which relates to our foreign subsidiary, because we have suffered recurring consolidated
 operating losses since inception and expect that to continue in the future; 

Although
 depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets that we currently depreciate and amortize will likely have to be replaced
 in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the cash required to fund such replacements; 

Adjusted
 EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation expense which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant
 recurring non-cash expense for our business and an important part of our compensation strategy; 

Adjusted
 EBITDA does not reflect the effect of earnings or charges resulting from matters that our management does not consider to be indicative
 of our ongoing operations. However, some of these charges and gains (such as mark-to-market adjustments, stock warrant expense, etc.)
 have recurred and may recur; and 

Other
 companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative
 measure.

Operating
Activities 

Our
net cash and cash equivalents used in operating activities consists of net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation
and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, changes in fair value of liability classified financial instruments, and as well
as changes in operating assets and liabilities. The primary changes in working capital items, such as the changes in accounts receivable
and deferred revenue, result from the difference in timing of payments from our customers related to contract performance obligations.
This may result in an operating cash flow source or use for the period, depending on the timing of payments received as compared to the
fulfillment of the performance obligation. 

Net
cash used in operating activities was 1.5 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024. Net cash used in operating activities
was due to our net loss of 2.1 million, which is offset by non-cash items of 0.1 million, primarily consisting of stock-based compensation,
and cash from operating assets and liabilities of 0.4 million due to the timing of cash payments to vendors and cash receipts from customers. 

By
comparison, the Company s net cash used in operating activities was 1.0 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023.
Net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was due to our net loss of 7.8 million, which is offset
by non-cash items of 6.7 million, primarily consisting of the change in fair value of convertible debt of 4.4 million, stock warrant
expense of 1.9 million and stock-based compensation expense of 0.4 million, and cash from operating assets and liabilities of 0.1
million due to the timing of cash payments to vendors and cash receipts from customers. 

Investing
Activities 

Our
investing activities have consisted primarily of property and equipment purchases. 

Net
cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2024 consisted of 6 thousand of purchased
property and equipment. 

By
comparison, no cash and cash equivalents were used or provided by investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2023. 

Financing
Activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities was 1.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, which primarily consisted of 1.3 million
and 0.4 million of proceeds from related party loans and our revolving line of credit, respectively. 

By
comparison, the Company s net cash provided by financing activities was 0.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023,
which primarily consisted of 1.1 million proceeds from the issuance of convertible promissory notes payable offset by 0.2 million of
Business Combination costs paid. 

Contractual
Obligations and Commitments and Going Concern Outlook 

Currently,
management does not believe that our cash and cash equivalents is sufficient to meet our foreseeable cash needs for at least the next
12 months. Our foreseeable cash needs, in addition to our recurring operating expenses, include our expected capital expenditures to
support the expansion of our infrastructure and workforce, interest expense and minimum contractual obligations. Management intends to
raise cash for operations through debt and equity offerings. As a result of the Company s recurring loss from operations and the
need for additional financing to fund its operating and capital requirements there is uncertainty regarding the Company s ability
to maintain liquidity sufficient to operate its business effectively, which raises substantial doubt as to the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern. 

Our
future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support research
and development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced product and service offerings,
and the cost of any future acquisitions of technology or businesses. In the event that additional financing is required from outside
sources, we may be unable to raise the funds on acceptable terms, if at all.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our condensed consolidated financial
statements which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. In preparing our financial statements, we make estimates, assumptions, and
judgments that can have a significant impact on our reported revenue, results of operations, and net income or loss, as well as on the
value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet during and as of the reporting periods. These estimates, assumptions, and
judgments are necessary because future events and their effects on our results of operations and the value of our assets cannot be determined
with certainty and are made based on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
These estimates may change as new events occur or additional information is obtained, and we may periodically be faced with uncertainties,
the outcomes of which are not within our control and may not be known for a prolonged period of time. Because the use of estimates is
inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. 

For
a discussion of our critical accounting estimates, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations in the Form 10-K/A, the notes to our audited financial statements appearing in the Form 10-K/A, and the notes to
the financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Report. There have been no material changes to these critical accounting policies
and estimates through March 31, 2024 from those discussed in the Form 10-K/A. 

Recently
Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 

A
description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position and results of operations
is disclosed in Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required
under this item. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange
Act), as of March 31, 2024. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as
of March 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of material weaknesses in our internal controls
over financial reporting which were not designed properly to ensure proper identification of non-routine transactions and ensure appropriate
segregation of duties. 

Material
Weakness 

As
disclosed elsewhere in this Report, we completed the Business Combination on November 7, 2023. Prior to the Business Combination, Data
Knights, our predecessor, was a special purpose acquisition company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange,
asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. As a result, previously
existing internal controls are no longer applicable or comprehensive enough as of the assessment date, because Data Knights operations
prior to the Business Combination were insignificant compared to those of the consolidated entity post-Business Combination. As a result,
management is aware of material weaknesses in the Company s internal control related to user access/segregation of duties, lack
of a formalized control environment and oversight of controls over financial reporting, errors in accounting for non-routine transactions,
and lack of record keeping. Due to the limited transactional volume currently experienced combined with our financial limitations, we
do not currently have an expanded accounting department that would allow us to better segregate duties. Over time, as we continue to
grow and add accounting staff, we expect to continue to enhance our internal control structure, including appropriate segregation of
duties. During September 2024, changes were made to accounting personnel to enhance our financial reporting structure, which we expect
to alleviate reporting pressures, including reporting of non-routine transactions. In addition, the new personnel has focused on creating
central filing repositories to manage accounting records and other company documents. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended March 31, 2024 that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

21 

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings. 

We
may be subject from time to time to various claims, lawsuits and other legal and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course
of business. Some of these claims, lawsuits and other proceedings may involve highly complex issues that are subject to substantial uncertainties,
and could result in damages, fines, penalties, non-monetary sanctions or relief. We are not presently party to any legal proceedings
that, in the opinion of management, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect
on our business, operating results, financial condition, or cash flows. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors. 

In
addition to the other information set forth in this Report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in the Risk Factors 
in the Form 10-K/A and our other public filings, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. There
have been no material changes from risk factors previously disclosed in Risk Factors in the Form 10-K/A and our other public
filings. 

Item
2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 

During
the three months ended March 31, 2024, we did not have sales of unregistered securities not previously included in a Current Report on
Form 8-K.

None. 

Item
