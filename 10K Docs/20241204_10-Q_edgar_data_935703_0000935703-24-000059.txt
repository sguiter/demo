 Note 3 - 
 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, consisting of million related to damaged inventory and million related to property and equipment. These losses were fully offset by insurance receivables. As of November 2, 2024, we have received insurance proceeds totaling million, including million related to damaged inventory and million related to damaged property and equipment. We expect that the remaining inventory losses and property and equipment losses will be fully offset by insurance recoveries under our distribution center insurance policies. 
 Expected insurance recoveries for business interruption and redevelopment costs greater than the losses recognized cannot be estimated at this time. 
 The foregoing losses and expected insurance recoveries are based on information currently available to us. We continue to assess these estimates and will recognize any changes to these estimates in the period(s) in which they are determined. The final losses, insurance recoveries and net charges could vary from these estimates. 
 Legal Proceedings 
 We are defendants in ordinary, routine litigation or proceedings incidental to our business, including employment-related matters; infringement of intellectual property rights; personal injury/wrongful death claims; real estate matters; environmental and safety issues; and product safety matters. Legal proceedings may also include class, collective, representative and large cases and arbitrations, including those described below. We will vigorously defend ourselves in these matters. We do not believe that any of these matters will, individually or in the aggregate, have a material effect on our business, financial condition, or liquidity. We cannot give assurance, however, that one or more of these matters will not have a material effect on our results of operations for the quarter or year in which they are reserved or resolved. 
 We assess our legal proceedings monthly and reserves are established if a loss is probable and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. Many, if not substantially all, of our legal proceedings are subject to significant uncertainties and, therefore, determining the likelihood of a loss and the measurement of any loss can be complex and subject to judgment. With respect to the matters noted below where we have determined that a loss is reasonably possible but not probable, we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount or range of the possible loss at this time due to the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of and uncertainties regarding legal proceedings. Our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause us to change those estimates and assumptions. Management s assessment of legal proceedings could change because of future determinations or the discovery of facts which are not presently known. Accordingly, the ultimate costs of resolving these proceedings may be substantially higher or lower than currently estimated. 
 Active Matters 
 Talc Product Matters 
 Multiple personal injury lawsuits are pending in state court in California, Illinois, Louisiana, New York, Texas, and New Jersey against Dollar Tree, Family Dollar or both alleging that certain talc products that we sold caused cancer. The plaintiffs seek compensatory, punitive and exemplary damages, damages for loss of consortium, and attorneys fees and costs. Although we have been able to resolve previous talc lawsuits against us without material loss, given the inherent uncertainties of litigation there can be no assurances regarding the outcome of pending or future cases. Future costs to litigate these cases are not known but may be material, and it is uncertain whether our costs will be covered by insurance. In addition, although we have indemnification rights against our vendors in several of these cases, it is uncertain whether the vendors will have the financial ability to fulfill their obligations to us. 
 Acetaminophen Matters 
 Beginning in August 2022, more than personal injury cases have been filed in federal court against Dollar Tree, Family Dollar, or both, on behalf of minors alleging that their mothers took acetaminophen while pregnant, that the acetaminophen interfered with fetal development such that plaintiffs were born with autism and/or ADHD, and that we knew or should have known of the danger, had a duty to warn and failed to include appropriate warnings on the product labels. The plaintiffs seek compensatory, punitive and/or exemplary damages, restitution and disgorgement, economic damages, and attorneys fees and costs. These cases, which originated in Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee and Texas, along with other cases against many other defendants, were consolidated into multi-district court litigation in the Southern District of New York. The court disqualified plaintiffs experts and, on that basis dismissed all the cases which had been filed at the time of that decision, including all cases currently filed against us. The dismissal has been appealed to the Second Circuit by plaintiffs.

 retail discount stores in states and Canadian provinces. Our operations are conducted in reporting business segments: Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. We define our segments as those operations whose results our CODM regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. 
 The Dollar Tree segment is the leading operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise predominantly at the opening price point of , with additional offerings at higher price points. The Dollar Tree segment includes our operations under the Dollar Tree and Dollar Tree Canada brands, distribution centers in the United States and distribution centers in Canada. 
 The Family Dollar segment operates a chain of general merchandise retail discount stores providing consumers with a selection of competitively-priced merchandise in convenient neighborhood stores. The Family Dollar segment consists of our operations under the Family Dollar brand and distribution centers. The Family Dollar segment operating income (loss) includes advertising revenue, which is a component of Other revenue in the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Income Statements. On June 5, 2024, we announced that we had initiated a formal review of strategic alternatives for the Family Dollar business segment, which could include among others, a potential sale, spin-off or other disposition of the business. There is not a set deadline or definitive timetable for the completion of the strategic alternatives review process, and there can be no assurance that this process will result in any transaction or particular outcome. 
 We measure the results of our segments using, among other measures, each segment s net sales, gross profit and operating income (loss). The CODM reviews these metrics for each of our reporting segments. We may revise the measurement of each segment s operating income (loss), as determined by the information regularly reviewed by the CODM. If the measurement of a segment changes, prior period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period s presentation. Corporate, support and other consists primarily of store support center costs and the results of operations for our Summit Pointe property in Chesapeake, Virginia that are considered shared services and therefore, these selling, general and administrative costs are excluded from our reporting business segments.

Our forward-looking statements are all based on currently available operating, financial and business information. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties summarized below and the more detailed discussions in the Risk Factors and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations sections and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2024 and in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The following risks could have a material adverse impact on our sales, costs, profitability, financial performance or implementation of strategic initiatives:

Table of Contents 

 Our profitability is vulnerable to increases in merchandise, shipping, tariffs, freight and fuel costs, wage and benefit and other operating costs. 
 Higher costs and disruptions in our distribution network could have an adverse impact on our sales and profitability. 
 We may stop selling or recall certain products for safety-related or other issues. 
 We could experience a decline in consumer confidence and spending because of concerns about the quality and safety of our products or our brand standards. 
 Inflation or other adverse change or downturn in economic conditions could impact our sales or profitability. 
 Risks associated with merchandise supply could adversely affect our financial performance. 
 Our growth is dependent on our ability to increase sales in existing stores and to expand our square footage profitably.

 We could incur losses due to impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets.

 Legal proceedings may adversely affect our reputation and business, and higher costs related to reimbursing, settling, or litigating claims may impact our results of operations or financial condition. 
 Our failure to comply with applicable law, or to adequately respond to changes to such laws, could increase our expenses, expose us to legal risks or otherwise adversely affect us. 
 Our business is subject to evolving disclosure requirements and expectations with respect to environmental, social and governance matters that could expose us to numerous risks.

 Our business or the value of our common stock could be negatively affected as a result of actions by shareholders.

 We cannot assure you that the results, events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur, and actual results, events or circumstances could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. Moreover, new risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on our forward-looking statements. 
 We do not undertake to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. 
 Investors should also be aware that while we do, from time to time, communicate with securities analysts and others, it is against our policy to disclose to them any material, nonpublic information or other confidential commercial information. Accordingly, shareholders should not assume that we agree with any statement or report issued by any securities analyst regardless of the content of the statement or report. Furthermore, we have a policy against confirming projections, forecasts or opinions issued by others. Thus, to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections, forecasts or opinions, such reports are not our responsibility. 
 
 Overview 
 We are a leading operator of more than 16,500 retail discount stores and conduct our operations through two reporting segments. Our Dollar Tree segment is the leading operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise predominantly at the opening price point of 1.25, with additional offerings at higher price points. Our Family Dollar segment operates general merchandise retail discount stores providing consumers with a selection of competitively-priced merchandise in convenient neighborhood stores. 
 Our net sales are derived from the sale of merchandise. Two major factors tend to affect our net sales trends. First is our success at opening new stores. Second is the performance of stores once they are open which can be impacted by a number of factors including operational performance, competition, inflation, consumer buying preference and changes in the product assortment, pricing, or quality. Sales vary at our existing stores from one year to the next. We refer to this as a change in comparable store net sales, because we include only those stores that are open throughout both of the periods being compared, beginning after the first fifteen months of operation. We include sales from stores expanded, relocated or remodeled during the period in the calculation of comparable store net sales, which has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales. Stores that have been re-bannered (i.e., Family Dollar stores converted to Dollar Tree stores, or vice versa) are considered to be new stores and are not included in the calculation of the comparable store net sales change until after the first fifteen months of operation under the new brand. Sales that are excluded from the calculation of comparable store net sales are referred to as non-comparable store sales and consist of sales from new stores open fifteen months or less and stores that are closed permanently or expected to be closed for more than 90 days. 
 Quarterly Results 
 Financial highlights for the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024, as compared to the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023, include: 
 Net sales increased 3.5 to 7,561.7 million, primarily due to a 1.8 enterprise-wide comparable store net sales increase. 
 Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, increased 120 basis points to 30.9 , primarily due to lower freight costs and improved shrink results in relation to accruals, partially offset by increased distribution costs. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of total revenues, increased 90 basis points to 26.6 , primarily due to higher depreciation expense from store investments, higher professional fees related to the review of Family Dollar strategic alternatives, temporary labor on the Dollar Tree segment to support our multi-price rollout, higher utilities costs, and loss of leverage from the low single-digit comparable store net sales increase. 
 Operating income, as a percentage of total revenues, increased 30 basis points to 4.4 . 
 The effective tax rate was 23.7 , an increase of 190 basis points as compared to the prior year quarter, resulting primarily from lower Work Opportunity Tax Credits. 
 Net income was 233.3 million, or 1.08 per diluted share, compared to 212.0 million, or 0.97 per diluted share in the prior year quarter.

 At November 2, 2024, we operated stores in 48 states and the District of Columbia, as well as stores in five Canadian provinces. The average size of stores opened during the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024 was approximately 11,050 selling square feet for the Dollar Tree segment and 8,850 selling square feet for the Family Dollar segment. A breakdown of store counts and square footage by segment for the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023 is as follows:

 The store counts above do not include new stores until they are opened for sales. Stores are included as re-banners when they close or open, respectively. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we initiated a comprehensive store portfolio optimization review, including identifying stores as candidates for closure, re-bannering, or relocation. See the Strategic Initiatives and Recent Developments section below for additional detail. 
 The percentage change in comparable store net sales for the 13 and 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024, as compared with the preceding year, is as follows: 
 13 Weeks Ended November 2, 2024 
 39 Weeks Ended November 2, 2024 
 Sales Growth Change in Customer Traffic Change in Average Ticket Sales Growth Change in Customer Traffic Change in Average Ticket Consolidated 1.8 1.6 0.2 1.2 1.6 (0.5) Dollar Tree Segment 1.8 1.5 0.3 1.6 1.9 (0.3) Family Dollar Segment 1.9 1.8 0.6 1.2 (0.5) 
 Comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded, relocated and remodeled stores, which we include in the calculation, and are negatively affected when we open new stores, re-banner stores or expand stores near existing stores. 
 Net sales per selling square foot is calculated based on total net sales for the preceding 12 months as of the end of the reporting period divided by the average selling square footage during the period. Selling square footage excludes the storage, receiving and office space that generally occupies approximately 20 of the total square footage of our stores. We believe that net sales per selling square foot more accurately depicts the productivity and operating performance of our stores as it reflects the portion of our footprint that is dedicated to selling merchandise.

 For the 52 weeks ended November 2, 2024, Family Dollar s net sales per selling square foot includes net sales for the stores that were closed in connection with the store portfolio optimization review in the numerator of the calculation, but the related selling square footage as of November 2, 2024 is excluded from the denominator of the calculation which represents the average selling square footage for the 52-week period. See our Strategic Initiatives and Recent Developments below for more information on the initiatives that are driving our comparable store net sales growth and net sales per selling square foot growth. 
 Strategic Initiatives and Recent Developments 
 We continue to execute on a number of strategic initiatives across the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar segments to drive productive sales growth, improve operating efficiency, invest in technology, and expand our culture of service to our associates. These initiatives include, among others, the following. 
 Dollar Tree Merchandising. We continue to expand our brand assortment at the 1.25 price point to provide greater value to our customers and increase customer traffic and store productivity. We are continuing to expand our multi-price product assortment, which began with the introduction of 3 and 5 Dollar Tree Plus product in select discretionary categories, expanded into 3, 4 and 5 frozen and refrigerated product, and now comprises a wide assortment of other consumable and discretionary product at varying price points. As of November 2, 2024, we have expanded our multi-price assortment in approximately 2,300 stores. 
 99 Cents Only Stores Acquisition. During the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we acquired designation rights for up to 170 leases of 99 Cents Only Stores across Arizona, California, Nevada and Texas. The designation rights were acquired following the bankruptcy of 99 Cents Only Stores, which provided us an attractive opportunity to secure leases in priority markets. We secured the leases for 164 of these stores and substantially all have opened under our Dollar Tree segment. 
 Family Dollar Merchandising. Our store design initiatives at Family Dollar provide significantly improved merchandise offerings and establish a minimum number of cooler doors. We tailor space and assortment to local demographics with emerging formats including H2.5, our primary store format with optimized layout and expanded frozen and refrigerated doors; larger rural stores where assortments may include Dollar Tree product; and XSB (Extra Small Box), which adds elements of H2.5 optimized to our smaller stores, particularly in urban markets. As of November 2, 2024, we have more than 2,180 stores across these three formats. 
 Across all of Family Dollar s formats we are expanding our SKUs, continuing to add cooler doors, increasing our standard shelf height presentation, updating in-store signage, implementing planogram and category resets and updating our pricing strategy. We continue to introduce new private brands at Family Dollar, convert control brands to private brands and align our Family brand message across key categories. 
 Store Portfolio Optimization and Family Dollar Strategic Alternatives Reviews. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we announced that we had initiated a comprehensive store portfolio optimization review which involved identifying stores for closure, relocation or re-bannering based on an evaluation of current market conditions and individual store performance, among other factors. As a result of the portfolio optimization review, we identified approximately 970 underperforming Family Dollar stores, including approximately 600 stores to be closed in the first half of fiscal 2024, and approximately 370 stores to be closed at the end of each store's current lease term. As of November 2, 2024, we have closed approximately 670 stores identified under the portfolio optimization review and expect to close an additional 25 during the remainder of fiscal 2024. 
 During the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we announced that we had initiated a formal review of strategic alternatives for the Family Dollar business segment, which could include among others, a potential sale, spin-off or other disposition of the business. We continue to progress in our strategic review to position Family Dollar in an optimal ownership structure. There is not a set deadline or definitive timetable for the completion of the strategic alternatives review process, and there can be no assurance that this process will result in any transaction or particular outcome. 
 Our Workforce Our Workplace. Across both of our segments, we are investing in our talent, including initiatives to provide competitive pay and benefits, enhanced training, and attractive career opportunities to deliver an enhanced associate experience, reduce turnover, and improve our store standards and efficiencies and ultimately the customer experience. Additional initiatives include projects to optimize and modernize our stores, with a focus on improving the in-store experience through renovations and customer service enhancements.

 Supply Chain Optimization . Our supply chain initiatives include enhancing our distribution and transportation network, including investments in our truck fleet, transportation management systems, a new distribution center with enhanced automation to improve efficiency, and a new RotaCart delivery process to streamline the truck unloading and store delivery process. Significant investments are also underway to improve climate control conditions in our distribution centers. 
 Technology Investment. We continue our multi-year plan for significant investment in our technology across our business, including our mobile apps, store systems, merchandising and supply chain. We believe these improvements can promote operational efficiencies and deliver an elevated customer experience. 
 Marietta, Oklahoma Distribution Center. On April 28, 2024, a tornado destroyed our Dollar Tree distribution center in Marietta, Oklahoma. Based on the significant damage sustained by the facility, the inventory contained in the facility and the facility itself are not salvageable. We have pivoted our supply chain network to deliver products to the approximately 600 Marietta-serviced Dollar Tree stores, and we expect that these efforts will limit disruption to the Dollar Tree shopping experience. We are incurring additional costs within our supply chain as a result of servicing these impacted stores, including additional stem miles for delivered product and outside storage, and expect such costs to continue negatively impacting gross margin in the near-to-mid term. 
 General Liability Claims Development. Our self-insured general liability claims related to customer accidents and other incidents at our stores continue to develop unfavorably due to the rising costs to reimburse, settle, or litigate the claims. As a result, our actuarially determined liabilities were increased during the second quarter, contributing to a 64.3 million increase in our general liability claim expenses compared to the prior year second quarter. This increase was comprised of a 45.3 million increase in the Dollar Tree segment and a 19.0 million increase in the Family Dollar segment. 
 The liabilities related to our self-insurance programs, which include general liability claims, are estimates that require judgment and the use of assumptions. Refer to our Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions within Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the estimates and assumptions related to these liabilities. Such estimates are inherently uncertain, and future changes in claim trends and assumptions could result in significant adjustments to our liabilities, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.

 Results of Operations 
 Our results of operations and period-over-period changes are discussed in the following section. 
 Note that the cost of sales rate is calculated by dividing cost of sales by net sales. Gross profit margin is calculated as gross profit (i.e., net sales less cost of sales) divided by net sales. The selling, general and administrative expense rate, operating income margin and net income margin are calculated by dividing the applicable amount by total revenue. Basis points, as referred to below, are a percentage of net sales for expense categories within gross profit and cost of sales, and are a percentage of total revenue for all other expense categories. A 100 basis point increase equals 1.00 and a 1 basis point increase equals 0.01 . 
 The following table contains results of operations data for the 13 and 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023:

 The increase in net sales in the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024 was a result of comparable store net sales increases in the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar segments, and net sales of 401.4 million at non-comparable stores. The increase was partially offset by lower sales on the Family Dollar segment resulting from approximately 670 stores closed under the portfolio optimization review since the same period last year. 
 Enterprise comparable store net sales increased 1.8 in the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024, as a result of a 1.6 increase in customer traffic and a 0.2 increase in average ticket. Comparable store net sales increased 1.8 in the Dollar Tree segment and increased 1.9 in the Family Dollar segment. The low single-digit comparable store net sales increase was primarily impacted by the macro economic environment which continues to affect our customers due to the impact of inflationary pressures and higher interest rates. We expect these sales trends, and the resulting negative impact on operating income, to continue for the remainder of fiscal 2024.

The prior year included a 30.0 million accrual for DC 202-related legal matters.

 We invest capital to build and open new stores, expand and renovate existing stores, enhance and grow our distribution network, operate our existing stores, maintain and upgrade our technology, and support our other strategic initiatives. Our working capital requirements for existing stores are seasonal in nature and typically reach their peak in the months of September and October. We have satisfied our seasonal working capital requirements for existing and new stores and have funded our distribution network programs and other capital projects from internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities and commercial paper program. 
 The following table compares cash flow-related information for the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023: 
 39 Weeks Ended (in millions) November 2, 2024 October 28, 2023 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 1,788.2 1,429.6 Investing activities (1,359.1) (1,322.3) Financing activities (412.9) (301.9) 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased 358.6 million primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and higher current year earnings, excluding non-cash items, partially offset by increasing inventory levels and decreases in accrued liabilities. 
 Net cash used in investing activities increased 36.8 million primarily due to higher capital expenditures, partially offset by insurance recoveries related to damaged property and equipment at our Dollar Tree distribution center in Marietta, Oklahoma as discussed in Note 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q . 
 Net cash used in financing activities increased 111.0 million primarily due to lower net borrowings under our commercial paper program, partially offset by lower stock repurchases. 
 At November 2, 2024, our long-term borrowings were 3.45 billion, of which 1.0 billion matures in May 2025, and we had 1.5 billion available under our Revolving Credit Facility, less amounts outstanding for standby letters of credit totaling 4.1 million. We also have a commercial paper program under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to an aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 1.5 billion. As of November 2, 2024, there were no commercial paper notes outstanding. Our Revolving Credit Facility serves as a liquidity backstop for the repayment of notes outstanding under the program. We issued and repaid 3.2 billion of commercial paper notes during the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024 and incurred interest expense of 3.9 million related to these notes. Additionally, we have 250.0 million in trade letters of credit with various financial institutions, under which 3.6 million was committed to letters of credit issued for routine purchases of imported merchandise as of November 2, 2024.

 We repurchased 3,283,837 and 3,905,599 shares of common stock on the open market at a cost of 403.6 million and 504.3 million, including applicable excise tax, during the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, respectively. At November 2, 2024, we had 952.4 million remaining under our existing 2.5 billion Board repurchase authorization. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions 
 Our condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). To prepare these financial statements, we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Our estimates are often based on complex judgments, probabilities and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. It is also possible that other professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances, could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts. Actual results could be significantly different from these estimates. 
 Refer to Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2024, for a summary of our significant accounting policies. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of our business, including the impact of interest rate changes, diesel fuel cost changes and inflation. We may enter into interest rate or diesel fuel swaps to manage exposure to interest rate and diesel fuel price changes. We do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging and we do not hold derivative instruments for trading purposes. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our exposure to interest rate risk relates to our Revolving Credit Facility and borrowings under our commercial paper program. At November 2, 2024, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility or the commercial paper program. 
 Inflation Risk 
 The primary inflationary factors impacting our business include changes to the costs of merchandise, transportation (including the cost of diesel fuel), and labor. If these inflationary pressures become significant, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases on the Family Dollar segment or through adjustments to our product assortment, improvements in operational efficiencies or increases in our comparable store net sales on the Dollar Tree segment. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Our management has carried out, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of November 2, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were designed and functioning effectively to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. 
 We are undergoing a multi-year technology transformation which includes updating our core merchandise, warehouse management, point-of-sale, and human capital management systems. These updates are expected to continue over the next few years and management will continue to evaluate the design and implementation of our internal controls over financial reporting as the transformation continues. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended November 2, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
