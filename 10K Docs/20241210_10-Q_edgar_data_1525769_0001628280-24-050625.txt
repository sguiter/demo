 (1) Primarily consists of revenue earned from party rentals and gift card breakage (see Revenue recognition below). 
 Revenue Recognition Customers purchase cards with game play credits or chips to be used on a variety of redemption and simulation games. Entertainment revenues related to game play primarily consist of game play credits, which are used by customers to activate video and redemption games. Redemption games allow customers to earn tickets, which may be redeemed for prizes. We have deferred a portion of entertainment revenues for the estimated unfulfilled performance obligations related to unredeemed game play credits and tickets. The deferral is based on an estimated rate of future use by customers of unused game play credits and the material right provided to customers to redeem tickets in the future for prizes. The Company recognizes expected breakage as revenue in proportion to the pattern of redemption by the customers. This breakage is based on the Company s specific historical redemption patterns and will change as those redemption patterns change over time. Recognized game play credits and tickets breakage revenue is included in entertainment revenues in the statement of comprehensive income. During the nine months ended November 5, 2024, we recognized revenue of related to the amount in deferred entertainment revenues as of the end of fiscal 2023. 
 We recognize revenue on unredeemed gift cards in proportion to the pattern of redemption by the customers.

 and include or more options to renew. When determining the lease term, we include option periods for which renewal is reasonably certain. Most of the leases require us to pay property taxes, insurance, and maintenance of the leased assets. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Operating leases also include certain equipment leases that have a term in excess of one year. Certain facility leases also have provisions for additional contingent rentals based on revenues. 
 Operating lease cost, variable lease cost and short-term lease cost related primarily to our facilities is included in Other store operating expenses for our operating stores, Pre-opening costs for our stores not yet operating, or General and administrative expenses for our store support center and warehouse, in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

 Operating lease payments in the table above includes minimum lease payments for future sites for which the leases have commenced. As of November 5, 2024, the Company had signed lease agreements with total lease payments of related to facility leases which had not yet commenced. Fixed minimum lease payments related to these facilities are not included in the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of November 5, 2024. 
 Sale-leaseback transactions 
 In July 2024, the Company entered into a sale and master lease agreement (a "sale-leaseback") with an unrelated third party. Under this agreement, the Company sold of its store properties, including land, buildings and certain improvements, at a sale price of and then leased the assets back through the sale-leaseback transaction. 
 In September 2024, the Company entered into a sale-leaseback with an unrelated third party. Under this agreement, the Company sold of its store properties, including land, buildings and certain improvements, at a sale price of and then leased the assets back through the sale-leaseback transaction. 
 These transactions were accounted for as failed sale-leasebacks based on GAAP under ASC 842, Leases . As a result, the store property assets remain on the consolidated balance sheet at their historical net book value and are depreciated over the remaining term of the applicable master lease. Financing liabilities were recognized in the amount of the proceeds received, net of certain transactions costs, in the amount of and related to the July 2024 and September 2024 transactions, respectively. The Company will not recognize rent expense related to the leased assets. Instead, monthly rent payments under the applicable master lease agreement (initially, and per year related to the July 2024 and September 2024 transactions, respectively) will be recorded as interest expense and a reduction of the outstanding liability. 
 As of November 5, 2024, including the transactions noted above, the Company had financing liabilities related to properties. The current outstanding liability of is included in accrued liabilities and the long-term outstanding liability of is included in other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.

 Credit Facility 
 The Company has a senior secured credit agreement (the "Credit Facility") including a revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility") and a term loan facility (together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the Credit Facility ). On November 1, 2024, D B Inc. entered into an amendment with its banking syndicate, which amended the Credit Facility (the "Fourth Amendment"). For discussion of prior amendments, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 4, 2024. 
 The Fourth Amendment, among other things: 
 provides for a new tranche of term loans in an aggregate principal amount of (the Incremental Term B Loans with a maturity date of November 1, 2031, and 
 increased the Revolving Credit Facility by to a total and extended the maturity to November 1, 2029. 
 The proceeds from the Incremental Term B Loans were primarily used to: 
 redeem the of outstanding senior secured notes (see Senior Secured Notes below), and 
 pay down of the term loans outstanding under the Credit Facility immediately prior to the Fourth Amendment (the Existing Term B Loans ). 
 Both the Existing Term B Loans and the Incremental Term B Loans bear interest at Term SOFR or ABR (each, as defined in the amended Credit Facility) plus (i) in the case of Term SOFR loans, per annum and (ii) in the case of ABR loans, per annum. Loans under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest subject to a pricing grid based on net total leverage, at Term SOFR plus a spread ranging from to per annum or ABR plus a spread ranging from to per annum. Unused commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility incur initial commitment fees of to . Additionally, the interest rate margin applicable to the Existing Term B Loans and loans outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility would be subject to an additional step-down if a rating of B1/B+ or higher from Moody s and S P is achieved (which will step back up if such rating is subsequently not maintained). 
 A portion of the Revolving Credit Facility not to exceed is available for the issuance of letters of credit. As of November 5, 2024, we had letters of credit outstanding of and an unused commitment balance of under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Credit Facility may be increased through incremental facilities, by an amount equal to the greater of (i) and (ii) times trailing twelve-month Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the Credit Facility, plus additional amounts subject to compliance with applicable leverage ratio and/or interest coverage ratio requirements. The Credit Facility is unconditionally guaranteed by D B Holdings and certain of D B Inc. s existing and future wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries. 
 Senior Secured Notes 
 During fiscal 2020, the Company issued aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes (the Notes ). Interest on the Notes is payable in arrears on November 1 and May 1 of each year. The Notes mature on November 1, 2025, unless earlier redeemed, and are subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the related indenture. The Notes were issued by D B Inc. and are unconditionally guaranteed by D B Holdings and certain of D B Inc. s existing and future wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries. During fiscal 2021, the Company redeemed a total of outstanding principal amount of the Notes.

 Loss on debt refinancing 
 Term Loans Immediately prior to the Fourth Amendment, the Company had of unamortized debt issuance discounts and debt issuance costs. In connection with the Fourth Amendment described above, certain lenders exited the syndicate and were replaced by new syndicate members. The term loans, in the aggregate, were increased, a portion of the term loan facility was deemed extinguished, and a portion was determined to be modified. As a result, of unamortized costs were written off and of new fees were expensed on the modified portion resulting in a total charge of included in loss on debt refinancing on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The remaining unamortized issuance discounts and new issuance discount and costs immediately subsequent to the refinancings were deferred and are amortized into interest expense, net over the remaining term of the Existing Term B Loans and the Incremental Term B Loans. 
 Revolving Credit Facility Immediately prior to the Fourth Amendment, the Company had of unamortized debt issuance costs. In connection with the Fourth Amendment described above, certain lenders exited the syndicate and were replaced by new syndicate members. The Revolving Credit Facility was increased in size, a portion of the Revolving Credit Facility was deemed extinguished, and a portion was determined to be modified. As a result, of unamortized costs were written off and included in loss on debt refinancing on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The remaining unamortized issuance discounts and new issuance costs immediately subsequent to the refinancings were deferred and are amortized into interest expense, net over the remaining term of the Credit Facility. 
 The Notes Immediately prior to paying down the Notes, the Company had of unamortized debt issuance costs. The Notes were deemed fully extinguished, and all such costs were included in loss on debt refinancing on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 
 Restrictive covenants and debt compliance 
 Our debt agreements contain restrictive covenants that, among other things, place certain limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make loans or advances to subsidiaries and other entities, pay dividends, acquire other businesses or sell assets. The Credit Facility also requires the Company to maintain a maximum net total leverage ratio, as defined, as of the end of each fiscal quarter. As of November 5, 2024, we believe we were in compliance with all agreements, including all related covenants, governing our outstanding debt.

 Comparable store sales Comparable store sales are a comparison of sales to the same period of prior years for the comparable store base. We historically define the comparable store base to include those stores open for a full 18 months before the beginning of the current fiscal year and excluding stores permanently closed or planned for closure during the current fiscal year. For fiscal 2024, our comparable store base consists of 195 stores, of which 146 are Dave Buster's branded stores and 49 are Main Event branded stores. 
 New store openings Our ability to expand our business and reach new customers is influenced by the opening of additional stores in both new and existing markets. The success of our new stores is indicative of our brand appeal and the efficacy of our site selection and operating models. For the nine months ended November 5, 2024, we opened nine new stores (seven Dave Buster's branded stores and two Main Event branded stores). 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to the results provided in accordance with GAAP, we provide non-GAAP measures which present operating results on an adjusted basis. These are supplemental measures of performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP and include Adjusted EBITDA, Credit Adjusted EBITDA and Store Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization (defined below). These non-GAAP measures do not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flows from operations, as determined in accordance with GAAP, and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 Although we use these non-GAAP measures to assess the operating performance of our business, they have significant limitations as an analytical tool because they exclude certain material costs. For example, Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account a number of significant items, including our interest expense and depreciation and amortization expense. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain other costs which may be important in analyzing our GAAP results. Because Adjusted EBITDA does not account for these expenses, its utility as a measure of our operating performance has material limitations. Our calculations of Adjusted EBITDA adjust for these amounts because they do not directly relate to the ongoing operations of the currently underlying business of our stores and therefore complicate comparison of the underlying business between periods. Nevertheless, because of the limitations described above, management does not view Adjusted EBITDA, Credit Adjusted EBITDA or Store Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization in isolation and also uses other measures, such as revenues, gross margin, operating income and net income to measure operating performance. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income, plus interest expense, net, loss on debt refinancing, provision for (benefit from) income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, (gain) loss on property and equipment transactions, impairment of long-lived assets, share-based compensation, currency transaction (gains) losses and other costs. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is presented because we believe that it provides useful information to investors and analysts regarding our operating performance. By reporting Adjusted EBITDA, we provide a basis for comparison of our business operations between current, past and future periods by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. 
 Credit Adjusted EBITDA 
 We define Credit Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus certain items as defined at Adjusted EBITDA above, as well as certain other adjustments as defined in our Credit Facility (see Liquidity and Capital Resources below for additional discussion and reconciliation). These other adjustments include (i) increases in entertainment revenue deferrals, (ii) the cost of new projects, including store pre-opening costs, and (iii) other costs and adjustments as permitted by the debt agreements. We believe the presentation of Credit Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate as it provides additional information to investors about the calculation of, and compliance with, certain financial covenants in the Credit Facility. 
 Store Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization 
 We define Store Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization as operating income, plus depreciation and amortization expense, general and administrative expenses and pre-opening costs. Store Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization allows us to evaluate operating performance of each store across stores of varying size and volume. 
 We believe that Store Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization is another useful measure in evaluating our operating performance because it removes the impact of general and administrative expenses, which are not

 incurred at the store level, and the costs of opening new stores, which are non-recurring at the store level, and thereby enables the comparability of the operating performance of our stores for the periods presented. We also believe that Store Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization is a useful measure in evaluating our operating performance within the entertainment and dining industry because it permits the evaluation of store-level productivity, efficiency, and performance, and we use Store Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization as a means of evaluating store financial performance compared with our competitors. However, because this measure excludes significant items such as general and administrative expenses and pre-opening costs, as well as our interest expense, net, loss on debt refinancing and depreciation and amortization expense, which are important in evaluating our consolidated financial performance from period to period, the value of this measure is limited as a measure of our consolidated financial performance. 
 
 Presentation of Operating Results 
 We have historically operated on a 52 or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the Sunday after the Saturday closest to January 31. Each quarterly period reported has 13 weeks, except for 53-week fiscal years when the fourth quarter has 14 weeks. Fiscal 2023, which ended on February 4, 2024, followed this calendar and had 53 weeks. The first quarter of fiscal 2024 also followed this calendar and had 13 weeks. 
 On May 6, 2024, the first day of the second quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company changed its fiscal year to end on the Tuesday after the Monday closest to January 31 st . The change was made to improve labor and operational efficiencies by ending the Company's periods outside of the busier weekend timeframe. As a result of this change, the second quarter and fiscal year 2024 have two additional days added to its normal 13-week quarter and 52-week year. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 will end on February 4, 2025. 
 All dollar amounts are presented in millions, unless otherwise noted, except per share amounts. 
 
 Store-Level Variability, Quarterly Fluctuations, Seasonality and Inflation 
 We operate stores varying in size and have experienced significant variability among stores in volumes, operating results and net investment costs. 
 Our new stores typically open with sales volumes in excess of their expected long-term run-rate levels, which we refer to as a honeymoon effect. We traditionally expect our new store sales volumes in year two to be 10 to 20 lower than our year one targets, and to grow in line with the rest of our comparable store base thereafter. As a result of the substantial revenues associated with each new store, the number and timing of new store openings will result in significant fluctuations in quarterly results. 
 New store operating margins (excluding pre-opening expenses) during the first year of operation historically benefit from honeymoon sales leverage on occupancy, management labor and other fixed costs. This benefit is partially offset by normal inefficiencies in hourly labor and other costs associated with establishing a new store. In year two, operating margins may decline due to the loss of honeymoon sales leverage on fixed costs which is partially offset by improvements in store operating efficiency. 
 Our operating results historically have fluctuated due to seasonal factors. Typically, we have higher revenues associated with the spring and year-end holidays, which will continue to be susceptible to the impact of severe or unseasonably mild weather on customer traffic and sales during that period. Our third quarter, which encompasses the back-to-school fall season, has historically had lower revenues as compared to other quarters. 
 We expect that economic and environmental conditions and changes in regulatory legislation will continue to exert pressure on both supplier pricing and consumer spending related to entertainment and dining alternatives. There is no assurance that our cost of products will remain stable or that federal, state, or local minimum wage rates will not increase beyond amounts currently legislated, however, the effects of any supplier price increase or wage rate increases might be partially offset by selective price increases if competitively appropriate.

 Results of Operations 
 Revenues 
 Total revenues for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 13.9 million, or 3.0 , to 453.0 million compared to 466.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. Entertainment revenues for the third quarter of 2024 decreased by 7.4 million, or 2.5 , to 294.6 million from 302.0 million in the third quarter of 2023. Food sales decreased by 3.0 million, or 2.7 , to 106.6 million in the third quarter of 2024 from 109.6 million in the third quarter of 2023. Beverage sales decreased by 3.5 million, or 6.3 , to 51.8 million in the third quarter of 2024 from 55.3 million in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Revenue mix by category, as a percentage of total revenues, for the periods indicated was as follows: 
 Three Months Ended November 5, 2024 October 29, 2023 Entertainment revenues 65.0 64.7 Food revenues 23.5 23.5 Beverage revenues 11.5 11.8 
 Selected revenue and store data for the periods indicated are as follows: 
 Three Months Ended November 5, 2024 October 29, 2023 Change Comparable store revenues, on a fiscal calendar basis 383.2 426.5 (43.3) Noncomparable store revenues (1) 
 57.0 41.1 15.9 Changes in entertainment revenue deferrals 11.3 (1.5) 12.8 Other noncomparable revenues 1.5 0.8 0.7 Total revenues 453.0 466.9 (13.9) Comparable store operating weeks 2,535 2,535 Noncomparable store operating weeks (1) 
 431 239 192 Total store operating weeks 2,966 2,774 192 
 (1) Our noncomparable store count includes two stores that were closed during the second quarter of 2024. 
 The decrease in revenue is primarily attributable to a 43.3 million decrease in comparable store sales, partially offset by 15.9 million of incremental sales from new stores, an increase in other noncomparable revenues of 0.7 million, and 12.8 million in changes in entertainment revenue deferrals. The decrease in comparable store revenues is due primarily to a reduction in demand relative to a more robust consumer environment in the prior year period. The changes in entertainment revenue deferrals reflect breakage on unredeemed game play credits and tickets corresponding to guest redemption patterns over time. See Revenue Recognition at Note 1 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for discussion of revenue recognition associated with play credits and tickets. 
 The 43.3 million, or 10.2 , comparable store revenue decrease presented in the table above is on a fiscal period basis. Due to the 53rd week in fiscal 2023, the third quarter of 2024 ended one week later than the third quarter of 2023. Comparable store revenues based on the same calendar period adjusts for these impacts and compares the 91-day period from August 7, 2024 through November 5, 2024 to the 91-day period from August 9, 2023 through November 7, 2023. Comparable store revenues based on the same calendar period decreased 7.7 . 
 Cost of products 
 The total cost of products was 67.8 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 76.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. The total cost of products as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 15.0 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 16.4 for the third quarter of 2023. 
 Cost of entertainment was 25.1 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 30.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. The cost of entertainment, as a percentage of entertainment revenues, decreased to 8.5 for the third quarter of 2024 from 10.1 in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to price increases. 
 21 

Table of Contents 

 Cost of food and beverage products was 42.7 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 45.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. Cost of food and beverage products, as a percentage of food and beverage revenues, decreased to 27.0 for the third quarter of 2024 from 27.8 for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to food and beverage menu price increases, continued supply chain and ingredient optimization, and the mix of products sold with our new menu. 
 Operating payroll and benefits 
 Total operating payroll and benefits was 120.9 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 119.9 million in the third quarter of 2023. The total cost of operating payroll and benefits as a percentage of total revenues was 26.7 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 25.7 in the third quarter of 2023. This increase is primarily due to additional stores in the current year and employee retention tax credits recognized in the prior year, partially offset by labor management efficiencies. 
 Other store operating expenses 
 Other store operating expenses was 171.7 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 167.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. Other store operating expense as a percentage of total revenues increased to 37.9 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 35.9 in the third quarter of 2023. The increase is primarily due to higher occupancy costs for new stores and repairs maintenance costs. 
 General and administrative expenses 
 General and administrative expenses decreased to 27.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 28.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was driven primarily by lower share-based and incentive compensation in the current year, partially offset by increased consulting and other costs related to discrete, one-time initiatives. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 6.0 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 6.1 in the third quarter of 2023 for the same reasons. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased to 53.9 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 51.9 million in the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to new store openings and store remodels. 
 Pre-opening costs 
 Pre-opening costs of 5.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 increased to 4.0 million in the third quarter of 2023 due to the timing of costs in our pipeline of new stores for each period. 
 Interest expense, net 
 Interest expense, net increased to 32.9 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 28.9 million in the third quarter of 2023 due primarily to a decrease in interest income and incremental interest expense associated with sale-leaseback transactions and borrowings outstanding under our Credit Agreement, partially offset by a decrease in interest rates on our Credit Facility. See further discussion of the Company's debt activity and failed sale-leaseback transaction at Note 4 and Note 3, respectively, to the unaudited consolidated financial statements. 
 Loss on debt refinancing 
 Loss on debt refinancing was 15.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 as a result of an amendment to our Credit Facility. See further discussion at Note 4 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements. 
 Benefit from income taxes 
 The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was 21.8 , compared to 49.5 for the third quarter of 2023. The third quarter of 2024 year tax provision included lower excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation and higher permanent differences compared to the third quarter of 2023.

 Revenues 
 Total revenues for the 2024 period decreased 8.1 million, or 0.5 , to 1,598.2 million compared to 1,606.3 million for the 2023 period. Entertainment revenues for the 2024 period increased by 0.1 million to 1,056.0 from 1,055.9 million in the 2023 period. Food sales decreased by 0.4 million, or 0.1 , to 370.4 million in the 2024 period from 370.8 million in the 2023 period. Beverage sales decreased by 7.8 million, or 4.3 , to 171.8 million in the 2024 period from 179.6 million in the 2023 period. 
 Revenue mix by category, as a percentage of total revenues, for the periods indicated was as follows:

 Selected revenue and store data for the periods indicated are as follows: 
 Nine Months Ended November 5, 2024 October 29, 2023 Change Comparable store revenues, on a fiscal calendar basis (1) 
 1,389.2 1,490.3 (101.1) Noncomparable store revenues (1)(2)

 1,182 587 595 Total store operating weeks 8,843 8,192 651 
 (1) During the 2024 period we adjusted our period close from Sunday to Tuesday of each week (see further discussion at Note 1). This adjustment had the effect of adding 56 store operating weeks for our comparable stores and nine weeks for our noncomparable stores for the 2024 period. 
 (2) Our noncomparable store count includes two stores that were closed during the 2024 period. 
 The decrease in revenue is primarily attributable to a 101.1 million decrease in comparable store sales and a decrease of 2.7 million in other noncomparable revenues, partially offset by 71.7 million of incremental sales from new stores and 24.0 million in changes in deferred entertainment revenue. The decrease in comparable store revenues is due primarily to a reduction in demand relative to a more robust consumer environment in the prior year period. The changes in entertainment revenue deferrals reflect breakage on unredeemed game play credits and tickets corresponding to guest redemption patterns over time. See Revenue Recognition at Note 1 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for discussion of revenue recognition associated with play credits and tickets 
 The 101.1 million, or 6.8 , comparable store revenue decrease presented in the table above is on a fiscal period basis. Due to the 53rd week in fiscal 2023, the 2024 period ended approximately one week later than the 2023 period. Additionally, the 2024 period includes two additional days of revenue due to the adjusted calendar discussed in the footnote to the table above. Comparable store revenues based on the same calendar period adjusts for this shift in weeks and compares the period from February 5, 2024 through November 5, 2024 to the period from February 6, 2023 through November 7, 2023. Comparable store revenues based on the same calendar period decreased 6.4 . 
 Cost of products 
 The total cost of products was 236.9 million for the 2024 period and 257.8 million for the 2023 period. The total cost of products as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 14.8 for the 2024 period compared to 16.0 for the 2023 period. 
 Cost of entertainment decreased to 91.2 million in the 2024 period compared to 101.0 million in the 2023 period. The cost of entertainment, as a percentage of entertainment revenues, decreased to 8.6 for the 2024 period from 9.6 in the 2023 period. The decrease was primarily attributable to price increases.

 Cost of food and beverage products decreased to 145.7 million for the 2024 period compared to 156.8 million for the 2023 period. Cost of food and beverage products, as a percentage of food and beverage revenues, decreased to 26.9 for the 2024 period from 28.5 for the 2023 period. The decrease was primarily attributable to food and beverage menu price increases, continued supply chain and ingredient optimization, and the mix of products sold with our new menu, partially offset by promotional pricing to drive traffic and loyalty engagement. 
 Operating payroll and benefits 
 Total operating payroll and benefits increased to 393.7 million in the 2024 period compared to 377.5 million in the 2023 period. The total cost of operating payroll and benefits as a percentage of total revenues was 24.6 in the 2024 period compared to 23.5 in the 2023 period. This increase is primarily due to additional stores in the current year and 9.6 million in employee retention tax credits recognized in the prior year, partially offset by labor management efficiencies. 
 Other store operating expenses 
 Other store operating expenses increased to 515.4 million in the 2024 period compared to 499.3 million in the 2023 period. The increase is primarily due to higher occupancy and utilities costs related to new store openings, marketing costs, and IT costs related to newly implemented store and enterprise technology systems, partially offset by gains on asset disposals and lease terminations and favorable self-insurance experience rates. Other store operating expense as a percentage of total revenues increased to 32.2 in the 2024 period compared to 31.1 in the 2023 period. This increase as a percentage of total revenues was due primarily to the reasons above. 
 General and administrative expenses 
 General and administrative expenses decreased to 89.1 million in the 2024 period compared to 92.0 million in the 2023 period. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was driven primarily by lower share-based and incentive compensation in the current year, partially offset by increased consulting and other costs related to discrete, one-time initiatives. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 5.6 in the 2024 period compared to 5.7 in the 2023 period due primarily to the reasons noted above. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased to 174.2 million in the 2024 period compared to 149.9 million in the 2023 period, primarily due to new store openings and remodels and the acceleration of depreciation for two store closures. 
 Pre-opening costs 
 Pre-opening costs of 12.6 million in the 2024 period was comparable to 12.7 million in the 2023 period primarily due to the similar cadence of new store openings. 
 Loss on debt refinancing 
 Loss on debt refinancing was 15.2 million in the 2024 period and 11.2 million in the 2023 period as a result of amendments to our Credit Facility in the respective periods. See further discussion at Note 4 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements. 
 Interest expense, net 
 Interest expense, net increased to 99.9 million in the 2024 period compared to 92.5 million in the 2023 period due primarily to incremental interest expense associated with sale-leaseback transactions and borrowings outstanding under our Credit Agreement, partially offset by a decrease in interest rates on our Credit Facility. See further discussion of the Company's debt activity and failed sale-leaseback transaction at Note 4 and Note 3, respectively, to the unaudited consolidated financial statements. 
 Provision for income taxes 
 The effective tax rate for the 2024 period was 19.9 , compared to 19.9 for the 2023 period.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Credit Facility 
 The Company has a senior secured credit agreement (the "Credit Facility") including a revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility") and a term loan facility (together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the Credit Facility ). On November 1, 2024, D B Inc. entered into an amendment with its banking syndicate, which amended the Credit Facility (the "Fourth Amendment"). For discussion of prior amendments, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 4, 2024. 
 The Fourth Amendment, among other things: 
 provides for a new tranche of term loans in an aggregate principal amount of 700.0 (the Incremental Term B Loans with a maturity date of November 1, 2031, and 
 increased the Revolving Credit Facility by 150.0 to a total 650.0 and extended the maturity to November 1, 2029. 
 The proceeds from the Incremental Term B Loans were primarily used to: 
 redeem the 440.0 of outstanding senior secured notes (see 7.625 Senior Secured Notes below), and 
 pay down 200.0 of the term loans outstanding under the Credit Facility immediately prior to the Fourth Amendment (the Existing Term B Loans ). 
 Both the Existing Term B Loans and the Incremental Term B Loans bear interest at Term SOFR or ABR (each, as defined in the amended Credit Facility) plus (i) in the case of Term SOFR loans, 3.25 per annum and (ii) in the case of ABR loans, 2.25 per annum. Loans under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest subject to a pricing grid based on net total leverage, at Term SOFR plus a spread ranging from 2.50 to 3.00 per annum or ABR plus a spread ranging from 1.50 to 2.00 per annum. Unused commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility incur initial commitment fees of 0.30 to 0.50 . Additionally, the interest rate margin applicable to the Existing Term B Loans and loans outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility would be subject to an additional 0.25 step-down if a rating of B1/B+ or higher from Moody s and S P is achieved (which will step back up if such rating is subsequently not maintained). 
 A portion of the Revolving Credit Facility not to exceed 35.0 is available for the issuance of letters of credit. As of November 5, 2024, we had letters of credit outstanding of 11.6 and an unused commitment balance of 537.4 under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Credit Facility may be increased through incremental facilities, by an amount equal to the greater of (i) 650.0 and (ii) 0.75 times trailing twelve-month Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the Credit Facility, plus additional amounts subject to compliance with applicable leverage ratio and/or interest coverage ratio requirements. The Credit Facility is unconditionally guaranteed by D B Holdings and certain of D B Inc. s existing and future wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries. 
 7.625 Senior Secured Notes 
 During fiscal 2020, the Company issued 550.0 aggregate principal amount of 7.625 senior secured notes (the Notes ). Interest on the Notes is payable in arrears on November 1 and May 1 of each year. The Notes mature on November 1, 2025, unless earlier redeemed, and are subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the related indenture. The Notes were issued by D B Inc. and are unconditionally guaranteed by D B Holdings and certain of D B Inc. s existing and future wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries. During fiscal 2021, the Company redeemed a total of 110.0 outstanding principal amount of the Notes. 
 On November 1, 2024, using the proceeds from the Fourth Amendment to the Credit Facility discussed above, the Company redeemed the remaining 440.0 outstanding principal amount of the Notes. 
 Loss on debt refinancing 
 Term Loans Immediately prior to the Fourth Amendment, the Company had 35.1 of unamortized debt issuance discounts and debt issuance costs. In connection with the Fourth Amendment described above, certain lenders exited the syndicate and were replaced by new syndicate members. The term loans, in the aggregate, were increased, a portion of the term loan facility was deemed extinguished, and a portion was determined to be modified. As a result, 4.1 of unamortized costs were written off and 8.2 of new fees were expensed on the modified portion resulting in a total charge of 12.3 included in loss on debt refinancing on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The remaining unamortized issuance discounts and new issuance discount and costs immediately subsequent to the refinancings were deferred and are

 amortized into interest expense, net over the remaining term of the Existing Term B Loans and the Incremental Term B Loans. 
 Revolving Credit Facility Immediately prior to the Fourth Amendment, the Company had 3.8 of unamortized debt issuance costs. In connection with the Fourth Amendment described above, certain lenders exited the syndicate and were replaced by new syndicate members. The Revolving Credit Facility was increased in size, a portion of the Revolving Credit Facility was deemed extinguished, and a portion was determined to be modified. As a result, 0.6 of unamortized costs were written off and included in loss on debt refinancing on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The remaining unamortized issuance discounts and new issuance costs immediately subsequent to the refinancings were deferred and are amortized into interest expense, net over the remaining term of the Credit Facility. 
 The Notes Immediately prior to paying down the Notes, the Company had 2.3 of unamortized debt issuance costs. The Notes were deemed fully extinguished, and all such costs were included in loss on debt refinancing on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 
 Sale-leaseback transactions 
 In July 2024, the Company entered into a sale and master lease agreement (a "sale-leaseback") with an unrelated third party. Under this agreement, the Company sold two of its store properties, including land, buildings and certain improvements, at a sale price of 44.8 and then leased the assets back through the sale-leaseback transaction. 
 In September 2024, the Company entered into a sale-leaseback with an unrelated third party. Under this agreement, the Company sold one of its store properties, including land, buildings and certain improvements, at a sale price of 28.5 and then leased the assets back through the sale-leaseback transaction. 
 These transactions were accounted for as failed sale-leasebacks based on GAAP under ASC 842, Leases . As a result, the store property assets remain on the consolidated balance sheet at their historical net book value and are depreciated over the remaining term of the applicable master lease. Financing liabilities were recognized in the amount of the proceeds received, net of certain transactions costs, in the amount of 44.3 and 28.0 related to the July 2024 and September 2024 transactions, respectively. The Company will not recognize rent expense related to the leased assets. Instead, monthly rent payments under the applicable master lease agreement (initially, 3.6 and 2.1 per year related to the July 2024 and September 2024 transactions, respectively) will be recorded as interest expense and a reduction of the outstanding liability. 
 As of November 5, 2024, including the transactions noted above, the Company had financing liabilities related to seven properties. The current outstanding liability of 0.3 is included in accrued liabilities and the long-term outstanding liability of 155.0 is included in other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. 
 Interest expense 
 The following table sets forth our recorded interest expense, net for the periods presented:

 Credit Adjusted EBITDA and Net Total Leverage Ratio . 
 Credit Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, represents net income plus certain items as defined at Adjusted EBITDA at Non-GAAP Financial Measures above, as well as certain other adjustments as defined in our Credit Facility. The following table reconciles Net income to Credit Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in our Credit Facility for the period indicated: 
 Trailing Four Quarters Ended November 5, 2024 Net income 85.1 Add back: Interest expense, net 134.8 Loss on debt refinancing 20.1 Provision for income taxes 25.8 Depreciation and amortization expense 232.8 Share-based compensation (1)

 6.8 Credit Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure 549.0 
 (1) Non-cash share-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated comprehensive income statement. 
 (2) Transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition and integration of Main Event recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated comprehensive income statement. 
 (3) System implementation costs represent expenses incurred related to the development and launch of new enterprise resource planning, human capital management and inventory software for our stores and store support teams. These charges are primarily recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated comprehensive income statement. 
 (4) Represents costs incurred, primarily consisting of occupancy and payroll related expenses, associated with the opening of new stores. These costs are considered a "cost of new projects" as defined in our Credit Facility. 
 (5) Amount primarily consists of one-time, third-party consulting fees, severance costs and (gain) loss on property and equipment transactions. The third-party consulting fees are not part of our ongoing operations and were incurred to execute two related, discrete, and project-based strategic initiatives aimed at transforming our marketing strategy, which are included in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. The transformative nature, narrow scope, and limited duration of these incremental consulting fees are not reflective of the ordinary course expenses incurred to operate our business.

 Dividends and Share Repurchases 
 Our Board of Directors has approved a share repurchase program with a total authorization limit of 500.0 million. During the 2024 period, the Company repurchased 2.04 million shares for a total of 88.0 million representing 5.1 of the shares issued and outstanding as of February 4, 2024. The remaining dollar value of shares that may be repurchased under the program is 112.0 million as of November 5, 2024. 
 There were no dividends declared or paid during the 2024 period. Future decisions to pay cash dividends or repurchase shares continue to be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will be dependent on our operating performance, financial condition, capital expenditure requirements, compliance with debt agreements and other factors that the Board of Directors considers relevant. 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 As of November 5, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of 8.6 million. The Company can operate with a working capital deficit because cash from sales is usually received before related liabilities for product supplies, labor and services become due. Our operations do not require significant inventory or receivables, and we continually invest in our business through the growth of stores and operating improvement additions, which are reflected as non-current assets and not a part of working capital. Based on our current business plan, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, combined with expected cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements but also to enable us, in the aggregate, to finance our capital allocation strategy, including capital expenditures, through at least the next twelve months. 
 Cash Flow Activity 
 Operating Activities Cash flow from operations typically provides us with a significant source of liquidity. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, team member compensation, occupancy, and other operating costs. Cash from operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, the timing of cash receipts and payments, and vendor payment terms. 
 Cash flow from operating activities decreased to 203.4 million for the 2024 period compared to 267.0 million for the 2023 period. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in net income and the timing of changes in working capital. 
 Investing Activities Cash flow used in investing increased to 359.9 million for the 2024 period from 207.2 million for the 2023 period primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures related to store remodels and new store openings.

 Financing Activities Cash flow from financing was 127.8 million in the 2024 period primarily consisting of net debt proceeds, proceeds from sale leaseback transactions and proceeds from stock option exercises, partially offset by share repurchases. Cash flow used in financing activities of 177.4 million in the 2023 period primarily consisted of share repurchases, partially offset by net debt proceeds. 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 Other than the debt refinancing activity discussed at Note 4 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements, there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations as reported on Form 10-K for the year ended February 4, 2024. 
 Accounting policies and estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates and assumptions affect amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of gain and loss contingencies at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Our current estimates are subject to change if different assumptions as to the outcome of future events were made. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis, and we adjust our assumptions and judgments when facts and circumstances dictate. Since future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty, actual results may differ from the estimates we used in preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements. A complete description of our critical accounting policies and estimates is included in our annual consolidated financial statements and the related notes in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 4, 2024. 
 
 Recent accounting pronouncements 
 Refer to Note 1 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 We are exposed to market price fluctuation in food, beverage, supplies and other costs such as energy. Given the historical volatility of certain of our food product prices, including proteins, seafood, produce, dairy products, and cooking oil, these fluctuations can materially impact our food costs. While our purchasing commitments partially mitigate the risk of such fluctuations, there is no assurance that supply and demand factors such as disease or inclement weather will not cause the prices of the commodities used in our restaurant operations to fluctuate. Additionally, the cost of purchased materials may be influenced by tariffs and other trade regulations which are outside of our control. To the extent that we do not pass along cost increases to our customers, our results of operations may be adversely affected. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 The Credit Facility, discussed further at Note 4 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements, is based on variable interest rates. As of November 5, 2024, the Company had 101.0 million outstanding on its revolving facility and an outstanding balance of 1,391.0 million on its term loan facility. The impact on our annual results of operations of a hypothetical one percentage point interest rate change on the outstanding balance of the credit facility as of November 5, 2024 would be approximately 14.9 million. 
 31 

Table of Contents 

 Inflation 
 Severe increases in inflation could affect the United States or global economies and have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operation. If several of the various costs in our business experience inflation at the same time, such as commodity price increases beyond our ability to control and increased labor costs, we may not be able to adjust prices to sufficiently offset the effect of the various cost increases without negatively impacting consumer demand. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 In fiscal 2023, we began the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system ERP to align processes across the organization, enhance operational efficiency, and provide timely information to the Company s management team related to the operation of the business. 
 During the second quarter of 2024, we substantially completed the implementation of the ERP, which also included new financial management, inventory management, payroll and human capital management systems. The implementation of these systems resulted in material changes to our internal controls. The Company updated our internal controls to reflect changes to the financial reporting business processes impacted by the implementation and will continue to monitor the impact of the implementation on our financial reporting business processes. 
 There were no other changes to our internal control over financial reporting practices or processes that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting during our third quarter ended November 5, 2024.

Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws, the chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty (a) to determine whether a nomination or any other business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 1.11 (including whether the stockholder or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made, solicited (or is part of a group which solicited) or did not so solicit, as the case may be, proxies or votes in support of such stockholder s nominee or proposal in compliance with such stockholder s 
 8 

representation as required by clause (A)(2)(c)(xi) of this Section 1.11) and (b) if any proposed nomination or business was not made or proposed in compliance with this Section 1.11, to declare that such nomination shall be disregarded or that such proposed business shall not be transacted. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.11, unless otherwise required by law, if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation to present a nomination or proposed business, such nomination shall be disregarded and such proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation. For purposes of this Section 1.11, to be considered a qualified representative of the stockholder, a person must be a duly authorized officer, manager or partner of such stockholder or must be authorized by a writing executed by such stockholder or an electronic transmission delivered by such stockholder, to act for such stockholder as proxy at the annual or special meeting of stockholders and such person must produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the writing or electronic transmission, at the annual or special meeting of stockholders.

 (3) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.11, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 1.11 provided however, that any references in these Bylaws to the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder are not intended to and shall not limit any requirements applicable to nominations or proposals as to any other business to be considered pursuant to this Section 1.11 (including paragraphs (A)(2) and (B) hereof), and compliance with paragraphs (A)(2) and (B) of this Section 1.11 shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to make nominations or submit other business (other than, as provided in the penultimate sentence of (A)(2), business other than nominations brought properly under and in compliance with Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act or any successor rule thereto, as may be amended from time to time). Nothing in this Section 1.11 shall be deemed to affect any rights (a) of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals or nominations in the Corporation s proxy statement pursuant to applicable Rule 14a-8 promulgated under the Exchange Act or (b) of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect directors if and to the extent provided for under any applicable provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation.

If the Board so fixes a date, such date shall also be the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless the Board determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making such determination. If no record date is fixed by the Board, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at

 In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board may fix a record date, which shall not be more than sixty (60) days prior to such action.

At each annual meeting, directors shall be elected to hold office until the next annual meeting and until their successors have been duly elected and qualified except that if any such election shall be not so held, such election shall take place at a stockholders meeting called and held in accordance with the DGCL. At any meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected, each director shall be elected by a majority of the votes cast with respect to such director provided , however, that, if there is a contested election, directors shall be elected by the plurality vote of the votes cast by the holders of shares present or represented at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon. An election shall be considered contested if, as of the 10th day before the Corporation mails its notice of meeting for such meeting to stockholders, the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected. For the purposes of this Section 2.2, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of votes for a director exceeds the number of votes against the director (with abstentions and broker non-votes not counted as votes cast). 
 In an election that is not contested, any incumbent director who fails to receive a majority of the votes cast shall promptly submit an offer to resign from the Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee shall recommend to the Board whether to accept or reject the director s offer to resign, or what other action should be taken. The Board shall act on the offer to resign, taking into account the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee s recommendation, within 90 days from the date of the certification of election results and publicly disclose its decision regarding the offer to resign and, if such offer is not accepted, the rationale behind the decision. Any director who offers to resign shall not participate in the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee s recommendation or the Board s decision.

If the Board accepts a director s resignation pursuant to this Section 2.2, or if a non-incumbent nominee for director is not elected, then the Board may fill the resulting vacancy pursuant to Section 2.7 of these Bylaws or decrease the size of the Board pursuant to this Section 2.2.

 INDEMNIFICATION AND ADVANCEMENT 
 7.1 Right to Indemnification . The Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as it presently exists or may hereafter be amended, any person 
 18 

(a Covered Person who was or is made or is threatened to be made a party or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a proceeding ), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person for whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or has or had agreed to become a director or officer of the Corporation, or, while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, against all liability and loss suffered and expenses (including attorneys fees) reasonably incurred by such Covered Person. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except as otherwise provided in Section 7.5, the Corporation shall be required to indemnify a Covered Person in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) commenced by such Covered Person only if the commencement of such proceeding (or part thereof) by the Covered Person was authorized in the specific case by the Board. 
 7.2 Prepayment of Expenses . The Corporation shall, to the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, pay the expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by a Covered Person in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition, provided, however, that, to the extent required by law, such payment of expenses in advance of the final disposition of the proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Covered Person to repay all amounts advanced if it should be ultimately determined that the Covered Person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article VII or otherwise. 
 7.3 Authorization of Indemnification . Any indemnification under this Article VII (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth Section 7.4. Such determination shall be made, with respect to a person who is a director or officer at the time of such determination, (i) by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (ii) by a committee of such directors designated by a majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (iii) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion or (iv) by the stockholders. Such determination shall be made, with respect to former directors and officers, by any person or persons having the authority to act on the matter on behalf of the Corporation. To the extent, however, that a present or former director or officer of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding set forth in Section 7.1 or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith, without the necessity of authorization in the specific case. 
 7.4 Good Faith Defined . For purposes of any determination under Section 7.3, a person shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to believe such person s conduct was unlawful, if such person s action was based on good faith reliance on the records or books of account of the Corporation or another enterprise, or on information supplied to such person by the officers of the Corporation or another enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Corporation or another enterprise or on information or records given or reports made to the Corporation or another enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with 
 19 

reasonable care by the Corporation or another enterprise. The term another enterprise as used in this Section 7.4 shall mean any other corporation or any partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise of which such person is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent. The provisions of this Section 7.4 shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the circumstances in which a person may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL. 
 7.5 Right of Claimant to Bring Suit . If a claim for indemnification (following the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding) or advancement of expenses under this Article VII is not paid in full within thirty (30) days after a written claim therefor by the Covered Person has been received by the Corporation, the Covered Person may file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid the expense (including attorneys fees) of prosecuting such proceeding. In any such action the Corporation shall have the burden of proving that the Covered Person is not entitled to the requested indemnification or advancement of expenses under applicable law. It shall be a defense to any such action brought to enforce a right to indemnification (but not in an action brought to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the DGCL (or other applicable law) for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither a contrary determination in the specific case under Section 7.3 nor the absence of any determination thereunder shall be a defense to such application or create a presumption that the claimant has not met any applicable standard of conduct. 
 7.6 Nonexclusivity of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses . The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this Article VII shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under the Certificate of Incorporation, any agreement, or pursuant to any vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such person s official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, it being the policy of the Corporation that, subject to the last sentence of Section 7.1, indemnification of the persons specified in Section 7.1 shall be made to the fullest extent permitted by law. The provisions of this Article VII shall not be deemed to preclude the indemnification of or advancement of expenses to any person who is not specified in Section 7.1 but whom the Corporation has the power or obligation to indemnify under the provisions of the DGCL, or otherwise. 
 7.7 Insurance . The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such person s status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power or the obligation to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this Article VII. 
 7.8 Certain Definitions . For purposes of this Article VII, references to the Corporation shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, employees or agents so that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, 
 20 

or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article VII with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as such person would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued. For purposes of this Article VII, references to fines shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to any employee benefit plan and references to serving at the request of the Corporation shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer, employee or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation as referred to in this Article VII. 
 7.9 Survival of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses . The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article VII shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. 
 7.10 Contract Rights . The obligations of the Corporation under this Article VII to indemnify, and advance expenses to, a Covered Person shall be considered a contract between the Corporation and such person, and no modification or repeal of any provision of this Article VII shall affect, to the detriment of such person, such obligations of the Corporation in connection with a claim based on any act or failure to act occurring before such modification or repeal.
