 owned consolidated subsidiary of Ellington Financial Inc., was formed as a Delaware limited liability company on December 14, 2012 and commenced operations on January 1, 2013. All of Ellington Financial Inc.'s operations and business activities are conducted through the Operating Partnership. Ellington Financial Inc., the Operating Partnership, and their consolidated subsidiaries are hereafter collectively referred to as the "Company." All intercompany accounts are eliminated in consolidation. 
 The Company conducts its operations to qualify and be taxed as a real estate investment trust, or "REIT," under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and has elected to be taxed as a corporation effective January 1, 2019. In anticipation of the Company's intended election to be taxed as a REIT under the Code beginning with its 2019 taxable year (the "REIT Election"), the Company implemented an internal restructuring as of December 31, 2018. As part of this restructuring, the Company moved certain of its non-REIT-qualifying investments and financial derivatives to taxable REIT subsidiaries or, "TRSs," and disposed of certain of its investments in non-REIT-qualifying investments and financial derivatives. 
 Ellington Financial Management LLC (the "Manager") is an SEC-registered investment adviser that serves as the Manager to the Company pursuant to the terms of its Seventh Amended and Restated Management Agreement (the "Management Agreement"), which was approved by Ellington Financial Inc.'s Board of Directors (the "Board of Directors") effective March 13, 2018. The Manager is an affiliate of Ellington Management Group, L.L.C. ("Ellington"), an investment management firm that is registered as both an investment adviser and a commodity pool operator. In accordance with the terms of the Management Agreement, the Manager implements the investment strategy and manages the business and operations on a day-to-day basis for the Company and performs certain services for the Company, subject to oversight by the Board of Directors. 
 On October 3, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of a controlling interest in Longbridge Financial, LLC ("Longbridge"), a reverse mortgage loan originator and servicer (the "Longbridge Transaction"). As a result of the Longbridge Transaction, the Company consolidates Longbridge's financial results. Additionally, on December 14, 2023, Arlington Asset Investment Corp., a Virginia corporation Arlington ), merged with and into EF Merger Sub Inc., a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger (the Arlington Merger Agreement which was entered into on May 29, 2023 (the Arlington Merger ). 
 reportable segments, the Investment Portfolio Segment and the Longbridge Segment. The Investment Portfolio Segment is focused on investing in a diverse array of financial assets, including residential and commercial mortgage loans; residential mortgage-backed securities, or "RMBS"; commercial mortgage-backed securities, or "CMBS"; investments referencing a portfolio of mortgage servicing rights on forward mortgage loans, or "Forward MSR-related investments"; consumer loans and asset-backed securities, or "ABS," including ABS backed by consumer loans; collateralized loan obligations, or "CLOs"; non-mortgage- and mortgage-related derivatives; debt and equity investments in loan origination companies; and other strategic investments. The Longbridge Segment is focused on the origination and servicing of reverse mortgage loans. Longbridge acquires reverse mortgage loans both through its origination activities and through secondary market purchases. Historically, the majority of loans acquired by Longbridge have been home equity conversion mortgage loans, or "HECMs," which are insured by the Federal Housing Administration, or "FHA." Such loans are generally eligible for securitization into HECM-backed MBS, or "HMBS," which are guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association, or "GNMA." Longbridge is an approved issuer of HMBS, and it transfers HECM loans into HMBS, which it then sells in the secondary market while retaining the servicing rights on the underlying HECM loans. Longbridge also originates and purchases non-FHA-insured reverse mortgage loans originated under guidelines established by private lenders, which the Company refers to as "Proprietary reverse mortgage loans." Proprietary reverse mortgage loans typically carry loan balances or credit lines that exceed FHA limits or have other characteristics that make them ineligible for FHA insurance.

 or more days past due, or when, in the opinion of management, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect either interest or principal in full. Once a loan is designated as in non-accrual status, as long as principal is still expected to be collectible in full, interest payments are recorded as interest income only when received (i.e., under the cash basis method); accruals of interest income are only resumed when the loan becomes contractually current and performance is demonstrated to be resumed. However, if principal is not expected to be collectible in full, the cost recovery method is used (i.e., no interest income is recognized, and all payments received whether contractually interest or principal are applied to cost). 
 Interest income on HECM reverse mortgage loans held-for-investment is recognized based on the stated rate of the loan. Such interest income is included on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations as a component of Net change from HECM reverse mortgage loans, at fair value. 
 For Forward MSR-related investments, the Company recognizes interest income based on the effective interest method. For purposes of estimating future expected cash flows, management uses various assumptions about the mortgage loans underlying the MSRs, including but not limited to the timing and amount of prepayments. These assumptions are re-evaluated not less than quarterly. Changes in projected cash flows may result in prospective changes in the yield/interest income recognized on such investments based on the updated expected future cash flows. Interest income on Forward MSR-related investments is included on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations as a component of Interest Income. 
 Certain of the Company's debt securities and loans, at the date of acquisition, have experienced or are expected to experience more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination. Consistent with the Company's application of the principles of ASU 2016-13, if at the date of acquisition for a particular asset the Company projects a significant difference between contractual cash flows and expected cash flows, it establishes an initial estimate for credit losses as an upward adjustment to the acquisition cost of the asset for the purpose of calculating interest income using the effective yield method. 
 In estimating future cash flows on the Company's debt securities, there are a number of assumptions that are subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies, including, in the case of MBS, assumptions relating to prepayment rates, default rates, loan loss severities, and loan repurchases. These estimates require the use of a significant amount of judgment.

 Cash and cash equivalents generally includes cash held in interest bearing overnight accounts, for which fair value equals the carrying value, and investments which are liquid in nature, such as investments in money market accounts or U.S. Treasury Bills, for which fair value equals the carrying value; such assets are considered Level 1. Restricted cash includes cash held in a segregated account for which fair value equals the carrying value; such assets are considered Level 1. Due from brokers and Due to brokers include collateral transferred to or received from counterparties, along with receivables and payables for open and/or closed derivative positions. These receivables and payables are short term in nature and any collateral transferred consists primarily of cash; fair value of these items is approximated by carrying value and such items are considered Level 1. The Company's reverse repurchase agreements, repurchase agreements, and other secured borrowings are carried at cost, which approximates fair value due to their short term nature. Reverse repurchase agreements, repurchase agreements, and other secured borrowings are classified as Level 2 based on the adequacy of the collateral and their short term nature.

 The Company is subject to credit risk in connection with its investments in loans. The two primary components of credit risk are default risk, which is the risk that a borrower fails to make scheduled principal and interest payments, and severity risk, which is the risk of loss upon a borrower default on a mortgage loan or other secured or unsecured loan. Severity risk includes the risk of loss of value of the property or other asset, if any, securing the loan, as well as the risk of loss associated with taking over the property or other asset, if any, including foreclosure costs. Credit risk in the loan portfolio can be amplified by exogenous shocks impacting our borrowers such as man-made or natural disasters, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

 During the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, the Company transferred proprietary reverse mortgage loans held-for-sale with an unpaid principal balance of million and million, respectively, to held-for-investment. 
 Unpoolable HECM loans can include unsecuritized inactive HECM loans as well as HECM loans that have reached 98 of their respective maximum claim amount, or the "MCA," and repurchased from the HMBS pool, or "HECM Buyout Loans." The MCA is equal to the lesser of a home's appraised value at the point in time that the conditional commitment is issued or the maximum loan limit that can be insured by FHA. Unpoolable HECM loans are not eligible for securitization into HMBS. 
 HECM loans where the borrower is deceased, no longer occupies the property, or is delinquent on tax and/or insurance payments, are categorized as "inactive." Active HECM loans that have reached 98 of the MCA and have been repurchased from the HMBS pool, or "ABOs," are subsequently assigned to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, or "HUD," which then reimburses the Company for the outstanding debt on the repurchased loan, up to the MCA. For inactive HECM Buyout Loans, or "NABOs," following resolution of the loan the Company files a claim with HUD for any recoverable remaining principal and advance balances. The timing and amount of the Company obligations with respect to MCA repurchases is uncertain as repurchase is dependent largely on circumstances outside of the Company s control, including the amount and timing of future draws and the status of the loan.

 In March 2023, the Company entered into various agreements including a Master Loan Purchase and Servicing Agreement (the "MLPS Agreement") with a third party (the "MLPS Counterparty"), whereby it agreed to purchase and service HECM Buyout Loans with an unpaid principal balance of million that had been previously repurchased from various HMBS pools by a third party HMBS issuer, and simultaneously finance such loans with the MLPS Counterparty. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company held HECM Buyout Loans purchased under the MLPS Agreement with a fair value of million and million, respectively, which are included in Loans, at fair value on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had million in unpaid principal balance of inactive reverse mortgage loans, of which million related to HECM loans and the remainder related to proprietary reverse mortgage loans. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had million in unpaid principal balance of inactive reverse mortgage loans, of which million related to HECM loans and the remainder related to proprietary reverse mortgage loans.

 TBAs 
 The Company transacts in the forward settling TBA market. Pursuant to these TBA transactions, the Company agrees to purchase or sell, for future delivery, Agency RMBS with certain principal and interest terms and certain types of underlying collateral, but the particular Agency RMBS to be delivered is not identified until shortly before the TBA settlement date. TBAs are generally liquid, have quoted market prices, and represent the most actively traded class of MBS. The Company uses TBAs to mitigate interest rate risk, usually by taking short positions. The Company also invests in TBAs as a means of acquiring additional exposure to Agency RMBS, or for investment purposes, including holding long positions. 
 The Company does not usually take delivery of TBAs; rather, it settles the associated receivable and payable with its trading counterparties on a net basis. Transactions with the same counterparty for the same TBA that result in a reduction of the position are treated as extinguished.

 Credit default swaps TBAs Futures Forwards Total return swaps Warrants 
 From time to time the Company enters into credit derivative contracts for which the Company sells credit protection ("written credit derivatives"). As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all of the Company's open written credit derivatives were credit default swaps on either mortgage/asset-backed indices (ABX and CMBX indices) or corporate bond indices (CDX), collectively referred to as credit indices, or on individual corporate bonds, for which the Company receives periodic payments at fixed rates from credit protection buyers, and is obligated to make payments to the credit protection buyer upon the occurrence of a "credit event" with respect to underlying reference assets. 
 Notional Value of Written Credit Derivatives (1) 
 
 (1) The notional value is the maximum amount that a seller of credit protection would be obligated to pay, and a buyer of credit protection would receive, upon occurrence of a "credit event." Movements in the value of credit default swap transactions may require the Company or the counterparty to post or receive collateral. Amounts due or owed under credit derivative contracts with an International Swaps and Derivatives Association, or "ISDA," counterparty may be offset against amounts due or owed on other credit derivative contracts with the same ISDA counterparty. As a result, the notional value of written credit derivatives involving a particular underlying reference asset or index has been reduced (but not below zero) by the notional value of any contracts where the Company has purchased credit protection on the same reference asset or index with the same ISDA counterparty. 
 A credit default swap on a credit index or a corporate bond typically terminates at the stated maturity date in the case of corporate indices or bonds, or, in the case of ABX and CMBX indices, the date that all of the reference assets underlying the index are paid off in full, retired, or otherwise cease to exist. Implied credit spreads may be used to determine the market value of such contracts and are reflective of the cost of buying/selling credit protection. Higher spreads would indicate a greater likelihood that a seller will be obligated to perform i.e. , make protection payments) under the contract. In situations where the credit quality of the underlying reference assets has deteriorated, the percentage of notional values that would be paid up front to enter into a new such contract ("points up front") is frequently used as an indication of credit risk. Credit protection sellers entering the market in such situations would expect to be paid points up front corresponding to the approximate fair value of the contract. As of September 30, 2024, the implied credit spread on the Company's outstanding written credit derivative ranged between 48 and 271 basis points as compared to a range of between 51 and 438 basis points as of December 31, 2023. Total net up-front payments (paid) or received relating to written credit derivatives outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was ) million and ) million, respectively.

 Residential Mortgage Loan Securitizations Non-QM loans 
 The Company has participated in securitizations of non-QM loans (each, a "non-QM securitization"). In each case, the applicable sponsor of such securitization (the "Sponsor") transferred a pool of non-QM loans (each, a "Collateral Pool") to a 
 
 63 

Table of Contents 

 of the aggregate unpaid principal balance of the applicable Collateral Pool as of the date as of which such loans were originally transferred to the applicable Issuing Entity. The purchase price that the Depositor is required to pay in connection with an Optional Redemption is equal to the sum of the unpaid principal balance of each class of Certificates as of the redemption date and any accrued and unpaid interest thereon. These Optional Redemption rights are held by the applicable Depositor and are deemed to give such Depositor effective control over the loans. In cases where the Depositor was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, the transfers of non-QM loans to each of the Issuing Entities do not qualify as sales under ASC 860-10, and the Company continues to reflect the loans on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet in Loans, at fair value. In cases where the Depositor was not wholly-owned or consolidated by the Company, the transfers of non-QM loans to the Issuing Entities did qualify as sales in accordance with ASC 860-10. 
 In the event that certain breaches of representations or warranties are discovered with respect to any underlying non-QM loans, the Company could be required to repurchase or replace such loans. 
 Each Sponsor also serves as the servicing administrator of its respective securitization, for which it is entitled to receive a monthly fee equal to one-twelfth of the product of (a) and (b) the unpaid principal balance of the underlying non-QM loans as of the first day of the related due period. Each Sponsor in its role as servicing administrator provides direction and consent for certain loss mitigation activities to the third-party servicer of the underlying non-QM loans. In certain circumstances, the servicing administrator will be required to reimburse the servicer for principal and interest advances and servicing advances made by the servicer. 
 Consolidated Residential Mortgage Loan Securitizations 
 For non-QM securitizations in which the Company owned 100 of the interests in both the Sponsor and Depositor ("Consolidated Residential Mortgage Loan Securitizations"), the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the Issuing Entities, which are VIEs, and has consolidated the Issuing Entities ("Consolidated Issuing Entities") given the Company's retained interests in each of the securitizations, together with the Optional Redemption rights held by the wholly-owned Depositor and the Company's ability to direct the third-party servicer regarding certain loss mitigation activities. Interest income from these loans and the expenses related to the servicing of these loans are included in Interest income and Investment related expenses Servicing expense, respectively, on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
 Each of the Consolidated Issuing Entities meet the definition of a CFE as defined in Note 2, and as a result the fair value of the assets of each of the Issuing Entities have been derived from the fair value of the liabilities of the respective Issuing Entity, as such liabilities have been assessed to be more observable than such assets.

 As described above, the Company has also participated in non-QM securitizations with various Non-QM Co-Participants. For the non-QM securitization which closed in December 2022, the Company and the Non-QM Co-Participant each sold loans to a jointly held entity (the "Residential Loan JV") which then transferred the loans to the respective series of the applicable Sponsor, which is wholly-owned by the Residential Loan JV, for further transfer to the applicable Depositor. For the non-QM securitizations that closed after December 2022, the Company and the Non-QM Co-Participants each sold loans directly to the respective series of the applicable Sponsor, for further transfer to the applicable Depositor. The sales by the Company in each instance were accounted for as sales in accordance with ASC 860-10.

 In order to comply with the Risk Retention Rules, the Participated Risk Retention Vehicle purchased a percentage of each of the classes of Certificates issued by the respective Issuing Entities. The aggregate fair value of the Company's ownership interests in the Residential Loan JV, and respective series of both the Participated Risk Retention Vehicle and Sponsor, was million as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Such interests are included on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet in Investments in unconsolidated entities, at fair value.

 million and million, respectively, and is included on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet in Securities, at fair value. 
 The Company has evaluated its interests in the Residential Loan JV, the Participated Risk Retention Vehicle, and the Sponsor, which are each VIEs. Because the Company does not control the assets of such entities nor does it have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact such entities' economic performance, the Company determined that the Company is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, and therefore the Company has not consolidated these VIEs. 
 Residential Mortgage Loan Securitizations European Residential Mortgage Loans 
 The Company holds an interest in a European RMBS issued by an unaffiliated European securitization trust (the "European RMBS Issuer"). The European RMBS Issuer issued various tranches of notes (the "European Debt Tranches") collateralized by a pool of European residential mortgage loans (the "European Mortgage Loan Securitization"). As of June 30, 2024, as the holder of a majority interest in the most subordinate European Debt Tranche, the Company may, at its sole option, purchase all of the outstanding European Debt Tranches (the "Optional Redemption"). 
 At June 30, 2024, the Company re-evaluated its interest in the European RMBS Issuer, which is a VIE. As of such date, because the Company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact such entities' economic performance, the Company determined that the Company is the current primary beneficiary of this VIE, and therefore the Company has consolidated the European RMBS Issuer. Prior to June 30, 2024, the Company determined that it was not the primary beneficiary of this VIE, and did not consolidate the European RMBS Issuer. As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of the Company's investment in the most subordinate European Debt Tranche was million and is included in Securities, at fair value on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.

 Participation in Multi-Seller Consumer Loan Securitizations 
 The Company has participated in various securitizations whereby the Company, together with certain other entities managed by Ellington (the "Consumer Co-Participants"), sold consumer loans to newly formed securitization trusts (each a "Consumer Securitization Issuer"). The sales were accounted for as sales in accordance with ASC 860-10.

 As shown in the above table, pursuant to each of the securitizations, the respective Consumer Securitization Issuer issued senior and subordinated notes. Trust certificates representing beneficial ownership of each of the Consumer Securitization Issuers were also issued. In connection with each transaction, through a jointly owned newly formed entity (each a "Consumer Risk Retention Vehicle"), the Company and the Consumer Co-Participants acquired certain of the subordinated notes as well as the trust certificates in the respective Consumer Securitization Issuer. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company's total interest in the Consumer Risk Retention Vehicles, for which the Company has elected the FVO, was 
 
 66 

Table of Contents 

 million and million, respectively. The fair value of the Consumer Risk Retention Vehicles is included on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet in Investments in unconsolidated entities, at fair value. 
 The notes and trust certificates issued by each of the Consumer Securitization Issuers are backed by the cash flows from the underlying consumer loans. If there are breaches of representations and warranties with respect to any underlying consumer loans, the Company could, under certain circumstances, be required to repurchase or replace such loans. Absent such breaches, the Company has no obligation to repurchase or replace any underlying consumer loans that become delinquent or otherwise default. In addition, another affiliate of Ellington acts as the administrator for these securitizations and is paid a monthly fee for its services. 
 The Consumer Securitization Issuers are each deemed to be a VIE. The Company has evaluated its interest in each of the Consumer Securitization Issuers under ASC 810, and while the Company retains credit risk in each of the securitization trusts through its beneficial ownership of most of the subordinated interests of each of the securitization trusts, which are the first to absorb credit losses on the securitized assets, neither the Company nor the Consumer Risk Retention Vehicles retain control of these assets or the power to direct the activities of the Consumer Securitization Issuers that most significantly impact the Consumer Securitization Issuers' economic performance. As a result, the Company determined that neither the Company nor the Consumer Risk Retention Vehicles are the primary beneficiary of the respective Consumer Securitization Issuer, and therefore the Company has not consolidated the Consumer Securitization Issuers. Additionally, the Company evaluated its interest in each of the Consumer Risk Retention Vehicles, which do not meet the criteria to be deemed a VIE, under the voting interest model provided by ASC 810 and determined the Company does not control the Consumer Risk Retention Vehicles. As a result, the Company has not consolidated the Consumer Risk Retention Vehicles. 
 Proprietary Reverse Mortgage Loan Securitizations 
 The Company has sponsored securitizations of reverse mortgage loans (each, a "Reverse Mortgage Securitization"). In each case, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary (the "RM Sponsor"), transferred a pool of proprietary reverse mortgage loans (each, a "RM Collateral Pool") to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the RM Sponsor (the "RM Depositor"), which then deposited such RM Collateral Pool into a newly created securitization trust on the related securitization closing date. Pursuant to the Reverse Mortgage Securitizations, the securitization trusts (collectively, the "RM Issuing Entities") issued various classes of asset-backed notes (the "RM Notes") which are backed by the cash flows from the underlying proprietary reverse mortgage loans. 
 The Company purchased and intends to hold, at a minimum, the requisite amount of RM Notes it is required to hold under the Risk Retention Rules. 
 The RM Sponsor also serves as the servicing administrator of each Reverse Mortgage Securitization, for which it is entitled to receive a monthly fee equal to one-twelfth of the product of (a) and (b) the unpaid principal balance of the underlying reverse mortgage loans as of the first day of the related due period. The Sponsor in its role as servicing administrator provides direction and consent for certain loss mitigation activities to the third-party servicer of the underlying reverse mortgage loans. In certain circumstances, the servicing administrator will be required to reimburse the servicer for principal and interest advances and servicing advances made by the servicer. 
 The Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of each of the RM Issuing Entities, which are VIEs, and has consolidated such entities given the Company's retained interests in each of the Reverse Mortgage Securitizations, together with the Optional Redemption rights held by the RM Depositor and the Company's ability to direct the third-party servicer regarding certain loss mitigation activities. Interest income from these loans and the expenses related to the servicing of these loans are included in Interest income and Investment related expenses Servicing expense, respectively, on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
 Each of the RM Issuing Entities meet the definition of a CFE and, as a result, the fair value of the assets of the RM Issuing Entities have been derived from the fair value of the liabilities of the RM Issuing Entities, as such liabilities have been assessed to be more observable than such assets. 
 The debt of the RM Issuing Entities is included in Other secured borrowings, at fair value, on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet and is shown net of the RM Notes held by the Company.

 Issuance of HMBS 
 Longbridge is approved as a Title II, non-supervised direct endorsement mortgagee with HUD. Longbridge is also an approved issuer of HMBS whereby it pools HECM loans and issues HMBS securities which are sold to third-parties with only the servicing rights retained. As discussed in Note 5, HMBS are structured whereby the HMBS issuer is required to repurchase loans whenever the outstanding principal balance of such loan reaches 98 of the MCA. In accordance with ASC 860-10, the transfer of the loans to the HMBS securitization vehicle does not qualify as a sale as the Company has not surrendered control over transferred financial assets. As a result, the transfer of the loans is accounted for as secured borrowings for which the Company has elected the FVO. Such secured borrowings are included in HMBS-related obligations, at fair value. The majority of the related collateral is included as a component of Loans, at fair value, on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company recognizes interest expense on such HMBS-related obligations based on the stated coupon rate of the respective HMBS. Interest expense and changes in fair value are recorded in net change related to HMBS obligations, at fair value on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. During the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company pooled HECM loans with an unpaid principal balance of million and million, respectively, into HMBS. During the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company pooled HECM loans with an unpaid principal balance of million and billion, respectively, into HMBS. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was servicing pools of HMBS with an unpaid principal balance of billion. As of December 31, 2023, the Company was servicing pools of HMBS with an unpaid principal balance of billion. 
 The Company had entered into a Collaboration and Transfer Agreement, or the "HECM CT Agreement" with a third party. Pursuant to the HECM CT Agreement, the Company purchased HECM loans and the associated MSR from the third party and securitized such loans into HMBS. While the Company was the legal owner and servicer of the HMBS, under the HECM CT Agreement, the third party received a portion of the cash flows generated from the HMBS. The Company retained a base participation fee, along with the right to premiums on subsequent HECM tail securitizations.

 Repurchase Agreements 
 The Company enters into repurchase agreements. A repurchase agreement involves the sale of an asset to a counterparty together with a simultaneous agreement to repurchase the transferred asset or similar asset from such counterparty at a future date. The Company accounts for its repurchase agreements as collateralized borrowings, with the transferred assets effectively serving as collateral for the related borrowing. The Company's repurchase agreements typically range in term from to days, although the Company also has repurchase agreements that provide for longer or shorter terms. The principal economic terms of each repurchase agreement such as loan amount, interest rate, and maturity date are typically negotiated on a transaction-by-transaction basis. Other terms and conditions, such as those relating to events of default, are typically governed under the Company's master repurchase agreements. Absent an event of default, the Company maintains beneficial ownership of the transferred securities during the term of the repurchase agreement and receives the related principal and interest payments. Interest rates on these borrowings are generally fixed based on prevailing rates corresponding to the terms of the borrowings, and for most repurchase agreements, interest is generally paid at the termination of the repurchase agreement, at which time the Company may enter into a new repurchase agreement at prevailing market rates with the same counterparty, repay that counterparty and possibly negotiate financing terms with a different counterparty, or choose to no longer finance the related asset. Some repurchase agreements provide for periodic payments of interest, such as monthly payments. In response to a decline in the fair value of the transferred securities, whether as a result of changes in market conditions, security paydowns, or other factors, repurchase agreement counterparties will typically make a margin call, whereby the Company will be required to post additional securities and/or cash as collateral with the counterparty in order to re-establish the agreed-upon collateralization requirements. In the event of increases in fair value of the transferred securities, the Company can generally require the counterparty to post collateral with it in the form of cash or securities. The Company is generally permitted to sell or re-pledge any securities posted by the counterparty as collateral; however, upon termination of the repurchase agreement, or other circumstance in which the counterparty is no longer required to post such margin, the Company must return to the counterparty the same security that had been posted. 
 At any given time, the Company seeks to have its outstanding borrowings under repurchase agreements with several different counterparties in order to reduce the exposure to any single counterparty. The Company had outstanding borrowings under repurchase agreements with and counterparties as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

For purposes of determining the Hurdle Amount, issuances of common stock, and Convertible Non-controlling Interests (a) as equity incentive awards, (b) to the Manager as part of its base management fee or incentive fee and (c) to the Manager or any of its affiliates in privately negotiated transactions, are excluded from the calculation.

 million and million, respectively. Such investments are included in Investments in unconsolidated entities, on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 The consumer, residential mortgage, and certain commercial mortgage loans that are the subject of the foregoing loan transactions are held in trusts, each of which the Company has determined to be a VIE. The Company has evaluated each of these VIEs and determined that the Company has the power to direct the activities of each VIE that most significantly impact such VIE's economic performance and the Company has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. As a result the Company has determined it is the primary beneficiary of each of these VIEs and has consolidated each VIE. 
 Equity Investment in Unconsolidated Entity 
 The Company is a co-investor, together with other affiliates of Ellington, in Jepson Holdings Limited ("Jepson"), the parent of an entity (the "Jepson Risk Retention Vehicle") that has sponsored various European mortgage loan securitizations. The Jepson Risk Retention Vehicle is expected to hold certain of the notes it issues for each securitization it completes in order to comply with European risk retention rules. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company's equity investment in Jepson Holdings Limited had a fair value of million and million, respectively. See Note 8 for additional details on this equity investment. 
 Participation in Multi-Borrower Financing Facilities 
 The Company is a co-participant with certain other entities managed by Ellington or its affiliates (the "Affiliated Entities") in various entities (each, a "Joint Entity"), which were formed in order to facilitate the financing of commercial mortgage loans, residential mortgage loans, and REO (collectively, the "Mortgage Loan and REO Assets"), through repurchase agreements. Each Joint Entity has a master repurchase agreement with a particular financing counterparty. 
 In connection with the financing of the Mortgage Loan and REO Assets under repurchase agreements, each of the Company and the Affiliated Entities transferred certain of their respective Mortgage Loan and REO Assets to one of the Joint Entities in exchange for its pro rata share of the financing proceeds that the respective Joint Entity received from the financing counterparty. While the Company's Mortgage Loan and REO Assets were transferred to the Joint Entity, the Company's Mortgage Loan and REO Assets and the related debt were not derecognized for financial reporting purposes, in accordance with ASC 860-10, because the Company continued to retain the risks and rewards of ownership of its Mortgage Loan and REO Assets. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Joint Entities had aggregate outstanding issued debt under the repurchase agreements in the amount of million and million, respectively. The Company's segregated silo of this debt as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, was million and million, respectively, and is included under the caption Repurchase agreements on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. To the extent that there is a default under the repurchase agreements, all of the assets of each respective Joint Entity, including those beneficially owned by any non-defaulting owners of such Joint Entity, could be used to satisfy the outstanding obligations under such repurchase agreement. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, no party to any of the repurchase agreements was in default. 
 Each of the Joint Entities has been determined to be a VIE. The Company has evaluated each of these VIEs and determined that it continued to retain the risks and rewards of ownership of certain of the Mortgage Loan and REO Assets, where such Mortgage Loan and REO Assets and the related debt are segregated for the Company and each of the Affiliated Entities. On account of the segregation of certain of each co-participant's assets and liabilities within each of the Joint Entities, as well as the retention by each co-participant of control over its segregated Mortgage Loan and REO Assets within the Joint Entities, the Company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of, and has consolidated its segregated silo of assets and liabilities within, each of the Joint Entities. See Note 12 and Note 14 for additional information. 
 Participation in CLO Transactions 
 As discussed in Note 13, the Company participated in a number of CLO securitization transactions, all managed by the CLO Manager. 
 The CLO Manager is entitled to receive management and incentive fees in accordance with the respective management agreements between the CLO Manager and the respective CLO Issuers. In accordance with the Management Agreement, the Manager rebates to the Company the portion of the management fees payable by each CLO Issuer to the CLO Manager that are allocable to the Company's participating interest in the unsecured subordinated notes issued by such CLO Issuer. For each of

 million. For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the amount of such management fee rebates was million and million, respectively. 
 In addition, from time to time, the Company along with various other affiliates of Ellington, and in certain cases various third parties, advance funds in the form of loans ("Initial Funding Loans") to securitization vehicles to enable them to establish warehouse facilities for the purpose of acquiring the assets to be securitized. Pursuant to the terms of the warehouse facilities and the Initial Funding Loans, the applicable securitization trust is required, at the closing of each respective CLO securitization, first to repay the warehouse facility, then to repay the Initial Funding Loans, and then to distribute interest earned, net of any necessary reserves and/or interest expense, and the aggregate realized or unrealized gains, if any, on assets purchased into the warehouse facility. In the event that such CLO securitization fails to close, the assets held by the respective securitization vehicle would, subject to a cure period, be liquidated. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company's investment in such warehouse facilities was thousand and million, respectively, which are included on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet in Investments in unconsolidated entities. 
 During the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company purchased million and million, respectively, of various underperforming corporate debt and equity securities from certain of the Ellington-sponsored CLO Securitizations. No such purchases were made during either of the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Such purchases are effected at market prices determined through the procedures set forth in the indentures of the respective Ellington-sponsored CLO Securitizations. 
 Investment in Affiliate 
 The Company has an investment in the common shares of Ellington Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. (the "Affiliated REIT"), which is an affiliate of the Company managed by an affiliate of Ellington (the "Affiliate REIT Manager"). The Company, Ellington, and various unrelated third parties (collectively, the "Affiliated REIT Founding Investors") have entered into various agreements committing to invest in the common stock of the Affiliated REIT. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had contributed million and its remaining commitment to fund capital calls was million; see Note 24 Commitments to Affiliate . As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the Company's investment in the Affiliated REIT was million. In accordance with the management agreement between the Affiliated REIT and the Affiliate REIT Manager (the "REIT Management Agreement"), investors pay a quarterly base management fee and, if certain performance hurdles are met, a performance fee. In accordance with the Management Agreement, the Manager rebates to the Company the portion of the management fee and performance fee payable to the Affiliated REIT Manager. 
 In connection with the commitment to contribute capital to the Affiliated REIT, each of the Affiliated REIT Founding Investors entered into an agreement with the Affiliate REIT Manager whereby each of the Affiliated REIT Founding Investors participates in a net revenue share arrangement based on each Affiliated REIT Founding Investors pro rata share of the Affiliate REIT s initial capital (the "Revenue Share Arrangement"). Under the terms of the Revenue Share Arrangement, each of the Affiliated REIT Founding Investors, including the Company, is entitled to receive from the Affiliate REIT Manager an amount equal to the product of (i) a fixed percentage and (ii) the management and performance fees earned by, less certain expenses incurred by, the Affiliate REIT Manager. The Revenue Share Arrangement will continue in perpetuity for each Affiliated REIT Founding Investor given (i) such Affiliate REIT Founding Investor has not defaulted on its obligation to fund its capital calls, and (ii) the REIT Management Agreement has not been terminated or is not renewed. To the extent that the net revenue share received by the Company is less than the management fees and performance fees incurred by the Company with respect to its investment in the Affiliated REIT, the Manager will rebate to the Company such difference. 
 The directors of the Affiliated REIT are currently: Michael Vranos, the Company's Co-Chief Investment Officer; Laurence Penn, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and President and a member of our Board of Directors; and Mark Tecotzky, the Company's Co-Chief Investment Officer. The Company has evaluated its interests in the Affiliated REIT, which is a VIE. Because the Company does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the Affiliated REIT's economic performance, the Company determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of the Affiliated REIT.

 billion and billion, respectively. Additionally, the Company has the obligation to advance various other reverse mortgage loan-related amounts such as the borrowers' property taxes and, in the case of HECM reverse mortgage loans, monthly insurance premiums to FHA. 
 Mandatory Repurchase Obligations 
 As detailed in Note 13, the Company is required to purchase from HMBS pools any HECM loan that has reached 98 of the MCA. For active loans, the Company subsequently assigns such loan to HUD, which then reimburses the Company up to the MCA. For inactive loans, following resolution of the loan, the Company files a claim with HUD for any recoverable remaining principal and advance balances. 
 Lease Commitments 
 Longbridge, a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, leases office space and office equipment, under various operating lease arrangements, which expire on various dates through January 2035. Additionally, as a result of the Arlington Merger, the Company assumed the remaining lease for Arlington's principal office space which expires in October 2024. As discussed in Note 2, the Company makes various assumptions and estimates in recognizing the operating lease ROU assets and corresponding lease liabilities, including the e xpected lease term, incremental borrowing rate, and identifying lease and non-lease components. Total expense under all operating leases amounted to million and million for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and to million and million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Such expense is included in Other expenses on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.

 Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 When used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, in future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the "SEC," or in press releases or other written or oral communications, statements which are not historical in nature, including those containing words such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "project," "plan," "continue," "intend," "should," "would," "could," "goal," "objective," "will," "may," "seek," or similar expressions or their negative forms or references to strategy, plans or intentions, are intended to identify "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the "Securities Act," and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the "Exchange Act," and, as such, may involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. 
 Forward-looking statements are based on our beliefs, assumptions, and expectations of our future operations, business strategies, performance, financial condition, liquidity and prospects, taking into account information currently available to us. These beliefs, assumptions, and expectations are subject to risks and uncertainties and can change as a result of many possible events or factors, not all of which are known to us. If a change occurs, our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and strategies may vary materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements. The following factors are examples of those that could cause actual results to vary from our forward-looking statements: changes in interest rates and the market value of our securities or our investments; market volatility; changes in the prepayment rates on the mortgage loans underlying the securities owned by us for which the principal and interest payments are guaranteed by a U.S. government agency or a U.S. government-sponsored entity; increased rates of default and/or decreased recovery rates on our assets; our ability to borrow to finance our assets and the available terms for such borrowings; changes in government regulations affecting our business; our ability to maintain our exclusion from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the "Investment Company Act"; our ability to maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust, or "REIT"; and risks associated with investing in real estate assets, including changes in business conditions and the general economy such as changes to fiscal or monetary policy, heightened inflation, slower growth or recession, and currency fluctuations. These and other risks, uncertainties and factors, including the risk factors described under Item 1A of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied in any forward-looking statements we make. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made. New risks and uncertainties arise over time, and it is not possible to predict those events or how they may affect us. Except as required by law, we are not obligated to, and do not intend to, update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. 
 
 Executive Summary 
 Our primary objective is to generate attractive, risk-adjusted total returns for our stockholders. We seek to attain this objective by utilizing an opportunistic strategy to make investments, without restriction as to ratings, structure, or position in the capital structure, that we believe compensate us appropriately for the risks associated with them rather than targeting a specific yield. At any particular point in time, depending on how we perceive the market's pricing of risk both generally and across sectors, we may favor higher-risk assets or we may favor lower-risk assets, or a combination of the two, in the interests of portfolio diversification or other considerations. 
 We conduct all of our operations and business activities through the Operating Partnership. As of September 30, 2024, we had an ownership interest of approximately 99.3 in the Operating Partnership. The remaining ownership interest of approximately 0.7 in the Operating Partnership represents the interests in the Operating Partnership that are owned by an affiliate of our Manager, our current and certain former directors, and certain current and former Ellington employees and their related parties, and is reflected in our financial statements as a non-controlling interest. We are externally managed and advised by our Manager, an affiliate of Ellington. Ellington is a registered investment adviser with a 29-year history of investing in the Agency and credit markets.

 We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or "the Code." Provided that we maintain our qualification as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal, state, and local income tax on our REIT taxable income that is currently distributed to our stockholders. Any taxes paid by a domestic taxable REIT subsidiary, or "TRS," will reduce the cash available for distribution to our stockholders. REITs are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that they currently distribute at least 90 of their annual REIT taxable income excluding net capital gains. 
 On October 3, 2022, we completed the acquisition of a controlling interest in Longbridge Financial, LLC ("Longbridge"), a reverse mortgage loan originator and servicer (the "Longbridge Transaction"). As a result of the Longbridge Transaction, we consolidate Longbridge's financial results. On December 14, 2023, we completed a merger between Arlington Asset Investment Corp., a Virginia corporation ("Arlington"), and our subsidiary EF Merger Sub Inc., a Virginia corporation (such transaction, the "Arlington Merger"). 
 In our investment portfolio, we invest in a diverse array of financial assets, including residential mortgage-backed securities, or "RMBS," including RMBS for which the principal and interest payments are guaranteed by a U.S. government agency or a U.S. government-sponsored entity, or "Agency RMBS"; residential and commercial mortgage loans; commercial mortgage-backed securities, or "CMBS"; consumer loans and asset-backed securities, or "ABS," including ABS backed by consumer loans; investments referencing mortgage servicing rights on traditional forward mortgage loans, or "Forward MSR-related investments"; collateralized loan obligations, or "CLOs"; non-mortgage- and mortgage-related derivatives; equity investments in loan origination companies; and other strategic investments. We refer to the portion of our investment portfolio excluding Agency RMBS as our credit portfolio. 
 Longbridge originates and services reverse mortgage loans, including both home equity conversion mortgage loans ("HECM loans") which are insured by the Federal Housing Administration ("FHA"), as well as non-FHA-insured reverse mortgage loans, which we refer to as "proprietary reverse mortgage loans." HECM loans are generally eligible for securitization into HECM-backed MBS ("HMBS"), which are guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association ("GNMA"). 
 The strategies that we employ are intended to capitalize on opportunities in the current market environment. Subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT and our exclusion from registration as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we intend to adjust our strategies to changing market conditions by shifting our asset allocations across various asset classes as credit and liquidity trends evolve over time. We believe that this flexibility, combined with Ellington's experience, will help us generate more consistent returns on our capital throughout changing market cycles. Additionally, subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT, we opportunistically hedge our credit risk, interest rate risk, yield spread risk, and foreign currency risk; however, at any point in time we may choose not to hedge all or a portion of these risks, and we will generally not hedge those risks that we believe are appropriate for us to take at such time, or that we believe would be impractical or prohibitively expensive to hedge. For more information on our targeted assets, see " Our Targeted Asset Classes" below.

 Agency RMBS 
 Our Agency RMBS assets consist primarily of whole pool (and to a lesser extent, partial pool) pass-through certificates, the principal and interest of which are guaranteed by a federally chartered corporation, such as the Federal National Mortgage Association, or "Fannie Mae," the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or "Freddie Mac," or the Government National Mortgage Association, within the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, or "Ginnie Mae," and which are backed by ARMs, Hybrid ARMs, or fixed-rate mortgages. In addition to investing in pass-through certificates which are backed by traditional mortgages, we have also invested in Agency RMBS backed by reverse mortgages. Reverse mortgages are mortgage loans for which neither principal nor interest is due until the borrower dies, the home is sold, or other trigger events occur. Mortgage pass-through certificates are securities representing undivided interests in pools of mortgage loans secured by real property where payments of both interest and principal, plus prepaid principal, on the securities are made monthly to holders of the security, in effect "passing through" monthly payments made by the individual borrowers on the mortgage loans that underlie the securities, net of fees paid to the issuer/guarantor and servicers of the securities. Whole pool pass-through certificates are mortgage pass-through certificates that represent the entire ownership of (as opposed to merely a partial undivided interest in) a pool of mortgage loans. 
 Our Agency RMBS assets are typically concentrated in specified pools. Specified pools are fixed-rate Agency pools consisting of mortgages with special characteristics, such as mortgages with low loan balances, mortgages backed by investor properties, mortgages originated through the government-sponsored "Making Homes Affordable" refinancing programs, and mortgages with various other characteristics. Our Agency strategy also includes RMBS that are backed by ARMs or Hybrid ARMs and reverse mortgages, and CMOs, including IOs, POs, and IIOs. 
 CLOs 
 CLOs are a form of asset-backed security typically collateralized by syndicated corporate loans or commercial mortgage loans. Our CLO holdings may include both debt and equity interests. Some of our CLOs include retained tranches from CLO securitizations for which we participated in the accumulation of the underlying assets. 
 CMBS 
 We acquire CMBS, which are securities collateralized by mortgage loans on commercial properties. The majority of CMBS issued are fixed rate securities backed by fixed rate loans made to multiple borrowers on a variety of property types, though single-borrower CMBS and floating rate CMBS have also been issued. 
 The majority of CMBS utilize senior/subordinate structures, similar to those found in non-Agency RMBS. Subordination levels vary so as to provide for one or more AAA credit ratings on the most senior classes, with less senior securities rated investment grade and non-investment grade, including a first loss component which is typically unrated. This first loss component is commonly referred to as the "B-piece," which is the most subordinated (and therefore highest yielding and riskiest) tranche of a CMBS securitization. We acquire investment grade, non-investment grade, and non-rated CMBS. Our target assets also include single-asset single-borrower CMBS, or "SASB CMBS." SASB CMBS can be collateralized by single properties or by a portfolio of properties. 
 Commercial Mortgage Loans and Other Commercial Real Estate Debt 
 We directly originate and participate in the origination of commercial mortgage "bridge" loans, which are loans secured by liens on commercial properties, and which have shorter terms and higher interest rates than more traditional commercial mortgage loans. Bridge loans are often secured by properties in transition, where the borrower is in the process of either re-developing or stabilizing operations at the property. 
 
 96 

Table of Contents 

 We also acquire seasoned commercial mortgage bridge loans, as well as longer-term commercial mortgage loans. Some of the seasoned commercial mortgage loans that we acquire may be non-performing, underperforming, or otherwise distressed; these loans are typically acquired at a discount both to their unpaid principal balances and to the value of the underlying real estate. 
 Our commercial mortgage loans may be fixed or floating rate and will generally have maturities ranging from one to ten years. We typically originate and acquire first-lien loans but may also originate and acquire subordinated loans. As of September 30, 2024, all of our commercial mortgage loans were first-lien loans. Commercial real estate debt typically limits the borrower's right to freely prepay for a period of time through provisions such as prepayment fees, lockout, yield maintenance, or defeasance provisions. 
 Within both our loan origination and acquisition strategies, we often focus on smaller balance loans and/or loan packages that are less-competitively-bid. These loans typically have balances that are less than 30 million, and are secured by real estate and, in some cases, a personal guarantee from the borrower. 
 Consumer Loans and ABS 
 We acquire U.S. consumer whole loans and ABS, including ABS backed by U.S. consumer loans. Our U.S. consumer loan portfolio consists of unsecured loans and secured auto loans. We are currently purchasing newly originated consumer loans under flow agreements with certain originators, as well as seasoned consumer loans in the secondary market, and we continue to evaluate new opportunities. 
 MSRs and MSR-Related Investments 
 An MSR represents the right to service one or more mortgage loans in exchange for a specified revenue stream, typically a portion of the interest payments due on such mortgage loans together with certain other ancillary revenue. While the owner of an MSR is ultimately responsible for servicing the underlying loans in accordance with applicable regulations, the actual loan servicing functions are often subcontracted out to third-party licensed subservicers. The mortgages underlying MSRs can either be traditional "forward" mortgage loans ("Forward MSRs") or reverse mortgage loans ("Reverse MSRs"). 
 The revenue stream associated with an MSR is often bifurcated into two components: a "base servicing fee," representing the actual or approximate cost of performing the loan servicing functions; and the remaining revenue, or "excess servicing spread." We have in the past acquired, and, may in the future acquire, excess servicing spread from mortgage loan servicers. 
 As a result of the Arlington Merger, the Company, through certain of its subsidiaries, is party to various agreements that enable the Company to participate in the economic returns of a portfolio of forward MSRs. The mortgage loans underlying such Forward MSR-related investments consist solely of residential mortgage loans guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. 
 Non-Agency RMBS 
 We acquire non-Agency RMBS backed by prime jumbo, Alt-A, non-QM, manufactured housing, subprime residential, and single-family-rental mortgage loans. The loans backing our non-Agency RMBS can be performing or non-performing. Our non-Agency RMBS holdings can include investment-grade and non-investment grade classes, including non-rated classes. 
 Non-Agency RMBS are generally debt obligations issued by private originators of, or investors in, residential mortgage loans. Non-Agency RMBS generally are issued as CMOs and are backed by pools of whole mortgage loans or by mortgage pass-through certificates. Non-Agency RMBS generally are securitized in senior/subordinated structures, or in excess spread/over-collateralization structures. In senior/subordinated structures, the subordinated tranches generally absorb all losses on the underlying mortgage loans before any losses are borne by the senior tranches. In excess spread/over-collateralization structures, losses are first absorbed by any existing over-collateralization, then borne by subordinated tranches and excess spread, which represents the difference between the interest payments received on the mortgage loans backing the RMBS and the interest due on the RMBS debt tranches, and finally by senior tranches and any remaining excess spread. We also have acquired, and may acquire in the future, both Agency-issued and non-Agency-issued CRTs, which have credit risks similar to those of subordinated RMBS tranches, as well as non-QM RMBS, including retained tranches from non-QM RMBS securitizations in which we have participated. 
 We also have acquired, and may acquire in the future, European RMBS, including retained tranches from European RMBS securitizations in which we have participated.

Table of Contents 

 Residential Mortgage Loans 
 Our residential mortgage loans include newly originated non-QM loans, residential transition loans, as well as legacy residential NPLs and RPLs. A non-QM loan is not necessarily high-risk, or subprime, but is instead a loan that does not conform to the complex Qualified Mortgage, or "QM," rules of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. For example, many non-QM loans are made to creditworthy borrowers who cannot provide traditional documentation for income, such as borrowers who are self-employed. There is also demand from certain creditworthy borrowers for loans above the QM 43 debt-to-income ratio limit that still meet all ability-to-repay standards. We hold equity investments in various non-QM originators, and to date we have purchased the majority of our non-QM loans from these originators, although we could potentially purchase a greater share of non-QM loans from other sources in the future. 
 The residential transition loans that we purchase are typically newly originated loans and include: (i) "fix and flip" loans, which are made to real estate investors for the purpose of acquiring residential homes, making value-add improvements to such homes, and reselling the newly rehabilitated homes for a potential profit, and (ii) loans made to real estate investors for a "business purpose," such as purchasing a rental investment property, financing or refinancing a fully rehabilitated home awaiting sale, or securing short-term financing pending qualification for longer-term lower-rate financing. Our residential transition loans are secured by non-owner occupied properties, and are typically structured as fixed-rate, interest-only loans with terms to maturity between 6 and 24 months. Our underwriting guidelines focus on both the "as is" and "as repaired" property values, borrower experience as a real estate investor, and asset verification. 
 We are also active in the market for residential NPLs and RPLs. The market for large residential NPL and RPL pools has remained highly concentrated, with the great majority having traded to only a handful of large players who typically securitize the residential NPLs and RPLs that they purchase. As a result, we have continued to focus our acquisitions on less-competitively-bid, and more attractively-priced mixed legacy pools sourced from motivated sellers. 
 We also acquire HELOCs and closed-end second lien loans, which are loans made to homeowners collateralized by the existing equity in their home. Closed-end second lien loans allow the borrower to take a one-time lump sum and are subordinate to the rights of the first lien mortgage holder as well as other potential senior liens. A HELOC is a line of credit that allows the borrower to draw down on their available line of credit as needed, and is subordinate to the rights of the first lien mortgage holder and to the rights of any other lien-holder on the home. 
 Reverse Mortgage Loans and Reverse MSRs 
 Reverse mortgage loans are residential mortgage loans for which neither principal nor interest is due until the borrower dies, the home is sold, or other trigger events occur. Reverse mortgage loans can have either fixed interest rates or adjustable interest rates. In the case of most fixed-rate reverse mortgage loans, the borrower must draw the loan proceeds up front in one lump sum, while many adjustable-rate mortgage loans provide the borrower with a line of credit that can be drawn over time. 
 As a result of the Longbridge Transaction, we consolidate Longbridge, which acquires reverse mortgage loans both through its origination activities and through secondary market purchases. Historically, the majority of loans acquired by Longbridge have been home equity conversion mortgage loans, or "HECMs," which are insured by FHA and eligible for inclusion in GNMA-guaranteed HECM-backed MBS, or "HMBS." Longbridge is an approved issuer of HMBS, and it pools and securitizes the majority of its HECM loans into HMBS, which it then sells in the secondary market while retaining the servicing rights on the underlying HECM loans. In addition, Longbridge opportunistically acquires, in the secondary market, HECM loans that have been mandatorily repurchased from HMBS pools ("HECM Buyout Loans") by other HECM servicers upon the outstanding principal balance of such loans reaching or exceeding 98 of their respective maximum claim amount. Depending on their status, HECM Buyout Loans are either eligible to be assigned to HUD in connection with an FHA insurance claim ("assignable buyout loans," or "ABOs"), or ineligible to be assigned to HUD ("non-assignable buyout loans," or "NABOs"). 
 Longbridge also originates and purchases proprietary reverse mortgage loans, which typically carry loan balances or credit lines that exceed FHA limits or have other characteristics that make them ineligible for FHA insurance. 
 The majority of Longbridge's existing MSRs relate to HECM loans that Longbridge pooled and securitized into HMBS and then sold into the secondary market with servicing rights retained. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, so long as Longbridge retains such mortgage servicing rights and the obligations relating thereto, such HECM loans do not meet the requirement for sale accounting in accordance with US GAAP and remain on Longbridge's balance sheet. The sold HMBS securities are accounted for as secured borrowings. In addition, Longbridge opportunistically acquires, in the secondary market or otherwise, MSRs associated with either proprietary reverse mortgage loans, HECMs or HECM buyout loans.

 Strategic Equity Investments in Loan Originators 
 We have made, and in the future may make additional, equity investments in loan originators and other related entities; historically, our investments have generally represented non-controlling interests, although we are not restricted from holding controlling interests in such entities. We have also acquired debt investments and/or warrants in certain of these loan originators. We have also entered into various other arrangements, such as entering into flow agreements or providing guarantees or financing lines, with certain of the loan originators in which we have invested. 
 TBAs and Other Mortgage-Related Derivatives 
 In addition to investing in specified pools of Agency RMBS, we utilize TBA transactions, whereby we agree to purchase or sell, for future delivery, Agency RMBS with certain principal and interest terms and certain types of underlying collateral, but the particular Agency RMBS to be delivered is not identified until shortly before the TBA settlement date. TBAs are liquid, have quoted market prices, and represent the most actively traded class of mortgage-backed securities, or "MBS." TBA trading is based on the assumption that mortgage pools that are eligible to be delivered at TBA settlement are fungible and thus the specific mortgage pools to be delivered do not need to be explicitly identified at the time a trade is initiated. 
 We generally engage in TBA transactions for purposes of managing certain risks associated with our investment strategies. Other than with respect to TBA transactions entered into by our TRSs, most of our TBA transactions are treated for tax purposes as hedging transactions used to hedge indebtedness incurred to acquire or carry real estate assets, or "qualifying liability hedges." The principal risks that we use TBAs to mitigate are interest rate and yield spread risks. For example, we may hedge the interest rate and/or yield spread risk inherent in our long Agency RMBS by taking short positions in TBAs that are similar in character. Alternatively, we may opportunistically engage in TBA transactions because we find them attractive in their own right, from a relative value perspective or otherwise. For accounting purposes, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or "U.S. GAAP," we classify TBA transactions as derivatives. 
 We also take long and short positions in various other mortgage-related derivative instruments, including mortgage-related credit default swaps. A credit default swap is a credit derivative contract in which one party (the protection buyer) pays an ongoing periodic premium (and often an upfront payment as well) to another party (the protection seller) in return for compensation for default (or similar credit event) by a reference entity. In this case, the reference entity can be an individual MBS or an index of several MBS, such as an ABX, PrimeX, or CMBX index. Payments from the protection seller to the protection buyer typically occur if a credit event takes place. A credit event can be triggered by, among other things, the reference entity's failure to pay its principal obligations or a severe ratings downgrade of the reference entity.

 Our other investment assets include real estate, including residential and commercial real property, strategic equity and/or debt investments in entities related to our business, corporate debt and equity securities, corporate loans, which can include litigation finance loans, and other non-mortgage-related derivatives. We do not typically purchase real property directly; rather, our real estate ownership usually results from foreclosure activity with respect to our acquired residential and commercial loans. 
 Hedging Instruments 
 Interest Rate Hedging 
 We opportunistically hedge our interest rate risk by using various hedging strategies, subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT. The interest rate hedging instruments that we use and may use in the future include, without limitation: 
 TBAs; 
 interest rate swaps (including floating-to-fixed, fixed-to-floating, floating-to-floating, or more complex swaps such as floating-to-inverse floating, callable or non-callable); 
 CMOs; 
 U.S. Treasury securities; 
 swaptions, caps, floors, and other derivatives on interest rates; 
 futures and forward contracts; and 
 options on any of the foregoing. 
 Because fluctuations in short-term interest rates may expose us to fluctuations in the spread between the interest we earn on certain of our investments and the interest we pay on certain of our borrowings, we may seek to manage such exposure by entering into short positions in interest rate swaps. An interest rate swap is an agreement to exchange interest rate cash flows, calculated on a notional principal amount, at specified payment dates during the life of the agreement. Typically, one party pays a fixed interest rate and receives a floating interest rate and the other party pays a floating interest rate and receives a fixed

 interest rate. Each party's payment obligation is computed using a different interest rate. In an interest rate swap, the notional principal is generally not exchanged. We generally enter into these transactions to offset the potential adverse effects of rising interest rates on short-term repurchase agreements. Our repurchase agreements generally have maturities of up to 364 days and carry interest rates that are determined by reference to a benchmark rate such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or "SOFR." As each then-existing fixed-rate repurchase agreement, or "repo," borrowing matures, it will generally be replaced with a new fixed-rate repo borrowing based on market interest rates established at that future date. 
 In the case of interest rate swaps, most of our agreements are structured such that we receive payments based on a variable interest rate and make payments based on a fixed interest rate. The variable interest rate on which payments are received is generally calculated based on various reset mechanisms for a benchmark rate such as SOFR. To the extent that the benchmark rates used to calculate the payments we receive on our interest rate swaps continue to be highly correlated with our repo borrowing costs, our interest rate swap contracts should help to reduce the variability of our overall repo borrowing costs, thus reducing risk to the extent we hold fixed-rate assets that are financed with repo borrowings. 
 Credit Risk Hedging 
 We enter into credit-hedging positions in order to protect against adverse credit events with respect to our credit investments, subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT. Our credit hedging portfolio can vary significantly from period to period, and can encompass a wide variety of financial instruments, including corporate debt or equity-related instruments, RMBS- or CMBS-related instruments, or instruments involving other markets. Our hedging instruments can include both "single-name" instruments (i.e., instruments referencing one underlying entity or security) and hedging instruments referencing indices. 
 Currently, our credit hedges consist primarily of financial instruments tied to corporate credit, such as CDS on corporate bond indices, short positions in and CDS on corporate bonds; and positions involving exchange traded funds, or "ETFs," of corporate bonds. Our credit hedges also currently include CDS tied to individual MBS or an index of several MBS, such as CDS on CMBS indices, or "CMBX." 
 Foreign Currency Hedging 
 To the extent that we hold instruments denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, we may enter into transactions to offset the potential adverse effects of changes in currency exchange rates, subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT. In particular, we may use currency forward contracts and other currency-related derivatives to mitigate this risk. 
 
 Trends and Recent Market Developments 
 Market Overview 
 After maintaining its target range for the federal funds rate in July, the U.S. Federal Reserve, or the "Federal Reserve," reduced the range by 50 basis points to 4.75 5.00 in September. In cutting rates for the first time in four years, the Federal Reserve "judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance." The Summary of Economic Projections released in September implied another 50 basis points of interest rate cuts in 2024. 
 In the third quarter, the Federal Reserve continued to reinvest only principal payments that exceeded 35 billion on Agency RMBS and 25 billion on U.S. Treasury securities, thus maintaining the reduced monthly reinvestment cap on U.S. Treasury securities announced at its May meeting. 
 After rising during the first half of the year, interest rates fell significantly in the third quarter, particularly short-term interest rates, and the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury exceeded that of the 2-year U.S. Treasury for the first time since July 2022. Quarter over quarter, the 2-year U.S. Treasury yield decreased by 111 basis points to 3.64 , and the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield declined by 62 basis points to 3.78 . Meanwhile, interest rate volatility, as measured by the MOVE index, spiked in early August and again in early September, before declining into quarter end. 
 In the third quarter, Secured Overnight Financing Rates, or "SOFR" rates, fell sharply following the decline in the federal funds rate, with one-month SOFR decreasing by 49 basis points to 4.85 and three-month SOFR decreasing by 73 basis points to 4.59 . SOFR rates drive many of our financing costs. 
 Mortgage rates moved in sympathy with long-term interest rates during the third quarter. The Freddie Mac survey 30-year mortgage rate decreased from 6.86 at the end of June to 6.08 on September 26th. While still low on an historical basis, the Mortgage Bankers Association's Refinance Index more than doubled during the third quarter, with mortgage rates lower. Overall prepayment speeds ticked up in July and August and then fell in September, with Fannie Mae 30-year RMBS registering CPRs of 6.6 in July, 6.7 in August, and 6.4 in September. 
 Year-to-date through August, the S P CoreLogic Case-Shiller US National Home Price NSA Index increased by 4.5 and the National Association of Realtors Housing Affordability Index declined by 1.9 .

 U.S. real GDP increased at an estimated annualized rate of 2.8 in the third quarter, as compared to 3.0 in the prior quarter. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate decreased moderately during the quarter, registering 4.3 in July, 4.2 in August, and 4.1 in September. 
 Inflation continued its modest decline in the third quarter, reaching a three-year low in September. The 12-month percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers CPI-U"), not seasonally adjusted, was 2.9 in July, 2.5 in August, and 2.4 in September 2024. This compares to 12-month percentage changes of 3.4 in April, 3.3 in May, and 3.0 in June 2024. 
 For the third quarter, the Bloomberg U.S. MBS Index posted a return of 5.48 and an excess return (on a duration-adjusted basis) of 0.76 relative to the Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Index. Meanwhile, the Bloomberg U.S. Corporate Bond Index generated a return of 5.81 and an excess return of 0.80 , and the Bloomberg U.S. Corporate High Yield Bond Index generated a return of 5.42 and an excess return of 1.83 , for the quarter. 
 Corporate credit spreads generally tightened during the third quarter, with spreads on the Markit CDX North America Investment Grade and High Yield Indices decreasing by 1 and 15 basis points quarter over quarter, respectively. Default rates on U.S. leveraged loans declined further, with the twelve-month trailing default rate on the Morningstar LSTA Leveraged Loan Index decreasing to 0.80 at quarter end, as compared to 0.92 at June 30th, and well below the 10-year historical average of 1.68 , per PitchBook | LCD. Additionally, the Morningstar LSTA US Leveraged Loan Index rose in the third quarter to 96.71 at September 30th, compared to 96.59 at June 30th. 
 Similar to U.S leveraged loans, default rates on EU leveraged loans also declined. The twelve-month trailing default rate on the Morningstar LSTA EU Leveraged Loan Index decreased to 0.79 at quarter end, as compared to 1.29 at June 30th, and below the 10-year historical average of 1.44 , per PitchBook | LCD. However, the Morningstar LSTA EU Leveraged Loan Index declined modestly in the third quarter to 97.58 at September 30th, compared to 97.61 at June 30th. 
 U.S. CLO issuance activity, while still elevated on an historical basis, declined in the third quarter. According to PitchBook | LCD, the U.S. CLO market saw 41 billion of new CLO issuance in the third quarter, compared to 53 billion in the second quarter. 
 U.S. equity markets performed well in the third quarter. The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by 8.2 and the S P 500 rose by 5.5 , with both indices ending the quarter at record highs. Meanwhile, the NASDAQ rose by 2.6 and reached a record high intra-quarter. Meanwhile, the VIX volatility index spiked in early August to its highest level since January 2021; the VIX subsequently moderated, but remained relatively elevated through quarter end. Finally, London's FTSE 100 index increased by 0.9 , and the MSCI World global equity index rose by 6.0 quarter over quarter.

 (9) Includes an investment in an unconsolidated entity holding European RMBS. 
 Our total long credit portfolio, excluding non-retained tranches of consolidated securitization trusts, increased by 19 to 3.25 billion as of September 30, 2024, from 2.73 billion as of June 30, 2024. The increase was primarily driven by net purchases of non-QM loans, closed-end second lien loans, HELOCs, commercial mortgage loans, and non-Agency RMBS. A portion of the increase was offset by smaller CLO and CMBS portfolios, driven by net sales. 
 Including associated financing costs and hedging gains and losses, strong net interest income and net gains from our non-QM loans and retained tranches, non-Agency RMBS, closed-end second lien loans, and CMBS drove the positive performance of our credit strategy in the third quarter. We also benefited from mark-to-market gains on our equity investments in the loan originators LendSure and American Heritage Lending, which reflected strong performance at those originators driven by increased origination volumes and strong gain-on-sale margins. Offsetting a portion of these gains were net losses on our consumer loan portfolio and a related equity investment in a consumer loan originator, as well as negative operating income on certain non-performing commercial mortgage loans and REO. Finally, we had a net loss on the Great Ajax common shares we had purchased in connection with last year's terminated merger.

 The percentage of delinquent loans in our residential mortgage loan portfolio decreased quarter over quarter, while the percentage of delinquent loans in our commercial mortgage loan portfolio (including loans accounted for as equity method investments) increased. Both of these portfolios continue to experience low levels of realized credit losses and strong overall credit performance, though we continue to work out several non-performing commercial mortgage assets. 
 During the quarter the net interest margin on our credit portfolio, including the effect of actual and accrued periodic payments on interest rate swaps used to hedge the assets, decreased to 2.64 from 2.76 . We continued to benefit from positive carry on our interest rate swap hedges, where we overall receive a higher floating rate and pay a lower fixed rate.

 As discussed in Note 16 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements, we, through a wholly-owned trust subsidiary, purchase automobile loans under agreements with a consumer loan originator. We have beneficial interests in the loan cash flows, which are net of servicing-related fees and expenses including a deferred performance-based fee to the consumer loan originator, in which we have a non-controlling equity interest. The total fair value of these investments, which are included in Securities, at fair value on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, was 65.7 million as of September 30, 2024.

 Our total long Agency RMBS portfolio decreased by approximately 14 quarter over quarter to 394.6 million, driven by net sales and principal repayments, which were partially offset by net gains. 
 In the third quarter, interest rates fell, the yield curve steepened, and Agency RMBS yield spreads tightened as the market anticipated the beginning of the Federal Reserve's interest rate cutting cycle. In September the Federal Reserve reduced the target range for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points and also released updated economic projections that implied another 50 basis points of interest rate cuts later in 2024. Overall for the third quarter, the U.S. Agency MBS Index generated an excess return of 0.76 . Against this backdrop, our Agency strategy generated positive results for the quarter, as net gains on our Agency RMBS exceeded net losses on interest rate hedges, which were driven by declining interest rates. 
 During the quarter, we continued to hedge interest rate risk through the use of interest rate swaps and short positions in U.S. Treasury securities and futures. We ended the quarter with a net short TBA position on a notional basis but a net long TBA position as measured by 10-year equivalents. Ten-year equivalents for a group of positions represent the amount of 10-year U.S. Treasury securities that would be expected to experience a similar change in market value under a standard parallel move in interest rates. 
 During the quarter, the net interest margin on our Agency RMBS, excluding the Catch-up Amortization Adjustment, increased to 2.03 from 1.99 . As with our credit strategy, we continued to benefit from positive carry on our interest rate swap hedges, where we overall receive a higher floating rate and pay a lower fixed rate. 
 As of both September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the weighted average net pass-through rate on our fixed-rate specified pools was 4.1 . Portfolio turnover for our Agency strategy, as measured by sales and excluding paydowns, was 17.1 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024. 
 We expect to continue to target specified pools that, taking into account their particular composition and based on our prepayment projections, should: (1) generate attractive yields relative to other Agency RMBS and U.S. Treasury securities, (2) have less prepayment sensitivity to government policy shocks, and/or (3) create opportunities for trading gains once the market recognizes their value, which for newer pools may come only after several months, when actual prepayment experience

 can be observed. We believe that our research team, proprietary prepayment models, and extensive databases remain essential tools in our implementation of this strategy. 
 The following table summarizes the prepayment rates for our portfolio of fixed-rate specified pools (excluding those backed by reverse mortgages) for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2023.

 Portfolio Overview and Outlook Longbridge 
 As discussed in Note 13 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, when Longbridge pools HECM loans into HMBS, such transfers do not qualify as sales under U.S. GAAP, and as a result, such transactions are treated as secured borrowings on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The pooled HECM loans are included in Loans, at fair value, and the related liabilities are reflected as HMBS-related obligations, at fair value. After pooling the HECM loans into

Table of Contents 

 HMBS, Longbridge retains the mortgage servicing rights associated with such HMBS, which we refer to as the "HMBS MSR Equivalent." Additionally, Longbridge typically retains the MSRs associated with the proprietary reverse mortgage loans that it originates and has acquired MSRs on reverse mortgage loans in the secondary market (collectively, "Reverse MSRs"). We refer to the HMBS MSR Equivalent and Reverse MSRs collectively as our "Reverse MSR-related Net Assets." We have also securitized some of the proprietary reverse mortgage loans originated by Longbridge, and we have retained certain securitization tranches in compliance with credit risk retention rules. 
 The following table summarizes loan-related assets (1) in the Longbridge segment as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024:

 (3) As of September 30, 2024, includes 8.2 million of active HECM Buyout Loans, 10.6 million of inactive HECM Buyout Loans, and 4.2 million of other inactive HECM loans. As of June 30, 2024, includes 5.1 million of active HECM Buyout Loans, 9.9 million of inactive HECM Buyout Loans, and 4.3 million of other inactive HECM loans. 
 (4) As of September 30, 2024, includes 390.6 million of securitized proprietary reverse mortgage loans and 9.0 million of cash held in securitization reserve funds. As of June 30, 2024, includes 181.1 million of securitized proprietary reverse mortgage loans and 4.5 million of cash held in a securitization reserve fund. 
 Our Longbridge segment generated a net loss attributable to common stockholders for the third quarter, driven by net losses on interest rate hedges, partially offset by positive results in originations. We had a mark-to-market gain on our HMBS MSR Equivalent, but this gain was muted by wider HMBS yield spreads, which resulted in a net loss on this position after taking into account the net losses on the interest rate hedges that we hold against this position. Wider HMBS yield spreads adversely affect the value of our HMBS MSR Equivalent because they lower the component of projected servicing income that stems from the right to fund and securitize future borrower draws. In HECM originations, a decline in origination margins, also driven by wider HMBS yield spreads, was partially offset by higher volumes; whereas in proprietary reverse originations, net gains related to the securitization in July, along with improved origination margins and higher volumes, led to strong profits in that product line. 
 Our Longbridge portfolio, excluding non-retained tranches of a consolidated securitization trusts, decreased by 5 sequentially to 494.2 million as of September 30, 2024, driven primarily by the completion of our securitization of proprietary reverse mortgage loans, partially offset by new proprietary reverse mortgage loan originations during the quarter.

 Corporate/Other 
 In addition to expenses not allocated to either the investment portfolio segment or Longbridge segment, our results for the quarter also reflect a net unrealized loss on our unsecured borrowings, driven by the decline in interest rates. This loss was partially offset by a net gain, also driven by the decrease in interest rates, on the fixed receiver interest rate swaps that we use to hedge the fixed payments on both our unsecured borrowings and our preferred equity. 
 Financing Overall 
 We have various financing arrangements in place as of September 30, 2024, including both secured and unsecured borrowings. We use repos, secured lines of credit, and various other secured borrowings to finance our portfolios, each of which we account for as collateralized borrowings. We have also obtained, through the securitization markets, term financing for certain of our non-QM loans, certain of our proprietary reverse mortgage loans, and certain of our consumer loans. Additionally, as an issuer of HMBS, we account for HMBS-related obligations as secured borrowings. Finally, as of September 30, 2024, we had 297.7 million of outstanding Unsecured borrowings including: (i) senior notes of 210.0 million, maturing in April 2027 and bearing an interest rate of 5.875 ; (ii) senior notes of 34.9 million, maturing in March 2025 and bearing an interest rate of 6.75 ; and (iii) senior notes of 37.8 million, maturing in August 2026 and bearing an interest rate of 6.00 (collectively, the "Senior Notes") as well as 15.0 million of unregistered junior subordinated unsecured debt securities (the "Trust Preferred Debt"). The indentures governing the outstanding Senior Notes contain a number of covenants, including several financial covenants. See Note 14 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on our Unsecured borrowings. 
 As of September 30, 2024, outstanding borrowings under repos and Total other secured borrowings (which include Other secured borrowings and Other secured borrowings, at fair value, as presented on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet) were 4.7 billion, of which approximately 7.3 , or 346.2 million, related to our Agency RMBS holdings. The remaining outstanding borrowings related to our credit portfolio and Longbridge. Additionally, we had 8.8 billion of HMBS-related obligations.

 (3) All of our non-recourse borrowings are secured by collateral. In the event of default under a non-recourse borrowing, the lender has a claim against the collateral but not any of the Operating Partnership's other assets. In the event of default under a recourse borrowing, the lender's claim is not limited to the collateral (if any). 
 (4) Relates to our non-QM, European residential mortgage, and reverse mortgage loan securitizations, where we have elected the fair value option on the related debt. 
 Our recourse debt-to-equity ratio, excluding U.S. Treasury securities and adjusted for unsettled purchases and sales, increased to 1.8:1 as of September 30, 2024 as compared to 1.6:1 as of June 30, 2024. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in borrowings on our larger credit portfolio, partially offset by a decrease in borrowings on our smaller Agency portfolio, the proprietary reverse mortgage securitization which converted certain recourse borrowings to non-recourse borrowings, and an increase in shareholders' equity. Our overall debt-to-equity ratio, based on total recourse and non-recourse borrowings excluding U.S. Treasury securities, adjusted for unsettled purchases and sales, also increased during the quarter, to 8.3:1 as of September 30, 2024, as compared to 8.2:1 as of June 30, 2024. 
 Our debt-to-equity ratio does not account for liabilities other than debt financings and does not include debt associated with securitization transactions accounted for as sales. 
 Our secured financing costs include interest expense related to our repo borrowings and Total other secured borrowings (which include Other secured borrowings and Other secured borrowings, at fair value, as presented on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet but exclude HMBS-related obligations). For the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, the average cost of funds on our secured financings increased to 5.94 , as compared to 5.73 for the three-month period ended June 30, 2024. Our unsecured financing costs consist of interest expense related to our Unsecured borrowings. For the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the average borrowing rate on our unsecured financings was 5.59 and 6.15 , respectively. Our average cost of funds, including both secured and unsecured financings, increased to 5.92 from 5.76 over the same period. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Ellington Financial Inc., its Operating Partnership, its subsidiaries, including Longbridge, and variable interest entities, or "VIEs," for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our critical accounting estimates are those which require assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain. Actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences could have a material impact on our financial condition and/or results of operations. We believe that all of the decisions and assessments upon which our consolidated financial statements are based were reasonable at the time made based upon information available to us at that time. We rely on the experience of our Manager and Ellington and analysis of historical and current market data in order to arrive at what we believe to be reasonable estimates. See Note 2 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies. We have identified our most critical accounting estimates to be the following: 
 Valuation : We have elected the fair value option for the vast majority of our assets and liabilities for which such election is permitted, as provided for under ASC 825, Financial Instruments ("ASC 825"). For financial instruments that are traded in an "active market," the best measure of fair value is the quoted market price. However, many of our financial instruments are not traded in an active market. Therefore, management generally uses third-party valuations when available. If third-party valuations are not available, management uses other valuation techniques, such as the discounted cash flow methodology. 
 Summary descriptions, for various categories of financial instruments, of the valuation methodologies management uses in determining fair value of our financial instruments are detailed in Note 2 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements. Management utilizes such methodologies to assign a good faith fair value (the estimated price that, in an orderly transaction at the valuation date, would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, as the case may be) to each such financial instrument. See the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on valuation techniques used by management in the valuation of our assets and liabilities. 
 Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, the estimated fair value of our financial instruments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the financial instruments existed, and the differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. 
 The determination of estimated fair value of those of our financial instruments that are not traded in an active market requires the use of both macroeconomic and microeconomic assumptions and/or inputs, which are generally based on current 
 
 110 

Table of Contents 

 market and economic conditions. Changes in market and/or economic conditions could have a significant adverse effect on the estimated fair value of our financial instruments. Changes to assumptions, including assumed market yields, may significantly impact the estimated fair value of our investments. Our valuations are sensitive to changes in interest rate; see the interest rate sensitivity analysis included in Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information. 
 VIEs : We evaluate each of our investments and other contractual arrangements to determine whether our interest constitutes a variable interest in a VIE, and if so whether we are the primary beneficiary of such VIE. In making these determinations we use both qualitative and quantitative analyses involving a significant amount of judgment, taking into consideration factors such as which interests in the VIE create or absorb variability, the contractual terms related to such interests, other transactions or agreements with the entity, key decision makers and their impact on the VIE s economic performance, and related party relationships. 
 Purchases and Sales of Investments and Investment Income : Purchase and sales transactions are generally recorded on trade date. Realized and unrealized gains and losses are calculated based on identified cost. 
 For securities, residential and commercial mortgage loans, consumer loans, and corporate loans, we generally amortize premiums and accrete discounts using the effective interest method. For certain of our securities, for purposes of estimating future expected cash flows, management uses assumptions including, but not limited to, assumptions for future prepayment rates, default rates, and loss severities (each of which may in turn incorporate various macroeconomic assumptions, such as future housing prices, GDP growth rates, and unemployment rates). In estimating future cash flows on certain of our loans, there are a number of assumptions that are subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies, including assumptions relating to prepayment rates, default rates, loan loss severities, and loan repurchases. These estimates require the use of a significant amount of judgment. Any resulting changes in effective yield are recognized prospectively based on the current amortized cost of the investment as adjusted for credit impairment, if any. 
 The effective yield on our debt securities that are deemed to be of high credit quality (including Agency RMBS, exclusive of interest only securities) can be significantly impacted by our estimate of future prepayments. Future prepayment rates are difficult to predict. We estimate prepayment rates over the remaining life of our securities using models that generally incorporate the forward yield curve, current mortgage rates, mortgage rates on the outstanding loans, age and size of the outstanding loans, and other factors. We compare estimated prepayments to actual prepayments on a quarterly basis, and effective yields are recalculated retroactive to the time of purchase. When differences arise between our previously calculated effective yields and our current calculated effective yields, a catch-up adjustment, or "Catch-up Amortization Adjustment," is made to interest income to reflect the cumulative impact of the changes in effective yields. For the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, we recognized a Catch-Up Amortization Adjustment of 0.5 million and 0.3 million, respectively. For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, we recognized a Catch-Up Amortization Adjustment of (0.1) million, and (0.6) million, respectively. The Catch-up Amortization Adjustment is reflected as an increase (decrease) to Interest income on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
 See the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on the assumptions and methods that we use to amortize purchase premiums and accrete purchase discounts. 
 Income Taxes : We have elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and are generally are not subject to corporate-level federal and state income tax on net income we distribute to our stockholders within the prescribed timeframes. We have elected to treat certain domestic and foreign subsidiaries as TRSs. Our financial results are generally not expected to reflect provisions for current or deferred income taxes, except for any activities conducted through one or more TRSs that are subject to corporate income taxation. Establishing a provision for income tax expense requires judgement and interpretation of the application of various federal, state, local, and foreign jurisdiction's tax laws. We may take positions with respect to certain tax issues which depend on legal interpretation of facts or applicable tax regulations. Should the relevant tax regulators successfully challenge any such positions, we might be found to have a tax liability that has not been recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Also, management's conclusions regarding the authoritative guidance may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based on changing tax laws, regulations, and interpretations thereof. See Note 2 and Note 15 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional details on income taxes.

 (2) In the table above, fair value of certain derivative transactions are shown on a net basis. The accompanying financial statements separate derivative transactions as either assets or liabilities. As of December 31, 2023, derivative assets and derivative liabilities were 144.0 million and (61.8) million, respectively, for a net fair value of 82.2 million, as reflected in "Net Total" above. 
 (3) Notional represents the maximum number of shares available to be purchased upon exercise.

 (5) Short notional value represents U.S. Dollars to be received by us at the maturity of the forward contract. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet reflected total assets of 16.0 billion and total liabilities of 14.3 billion. As of December 31, 2023, our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet reflected total assets of 15.3 billion and total liabilities of 13.8 billion. Our investments in securities, loans, MSRs, Forward MSR-related investments, unconsolidated entities, loan commitments, financial derivatives, and real estate owned included in total assets were 15.1 billion and 14.3 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Our investments in securities sold short and financial derivatives included in total liabilities were 354.2 million and 216.1 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, investments in securities sold short consisted principally of short positions in U.S. Treasury securities and sovereign bonds. We primarily use short positions in U.S. Treasury securities and sovereign bonds to hedge the risk of rising interest rates and foreign currency risk. 
 Typically, we hold a net short position in TBAs. The amounts of net short TBAs, as well as of other hedging instruments, may fluctuate according to the size of our investment portfolio as well as according to how we view market dynamics as favoring the use of one hedging instrument or another. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had a net short notional TBA position of 209.9 million and 57.9 million, respectively. 
 For a more detailed discussion of our investment portfolio, see " Trends and Recent Market Developments Portfolio Overview and Outlook " above. 
 We use mortgage-related credit derivatives primarily to hedge credit risk in certain credit strategies, although we have also taken net long positions in certain CDS on RMBS and CMBS indices. Our CDS on individual RMBS represent "single-name" positions whereby we have synthetically purchased credit protection on specific non-Agency RMBS bonds. As there is no longer an active market for CDS on individual RMBS or CDS on RMBS indices, our portfolios in these sectors continues to run off. We also use CDS on corporate bond indices, options thereon, and various other instruments as a means to hedge credit risk. As market conditions change, especially as the pricing of various credit hedging instruments changes in relation to our outlook on future credit performance, we continuously re-evaluate both the extent to which we hedge credit risk and the particular mix of instruments that we use to hedge credit risk. 
 We may hold long and/or short positions in corporate bonds or equities. Our long and short positions in corporate bonds or equities may serve as outright investments or portfolio hedges. 
 We use a variety of instruments to hedge interest rate risk in our portfolio, including non-derivative instruments such as U.S. Treasury securities and sovereign debt instruments, and derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps, TBAs, Eurodollar and U.S. Treasury futures, and options on the foregoing. The mix of instruments that we use to hedge interest rate risk may change materially from one period to the next. We have also entered into foreign currency forward and futures contracts in order to hedge risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations. 
 We have entered into repos to finance many of our assets. We account for our repos as collateralized borrowings. As of September 30, 2024 indebtedness outstanding on our repos was approximately 2.6 billion. As of September 30, 2024, our assets financed with repos consisted of Agency RMBS of 365.1 million, credit portfolio assets of 2.6 billion, reverse mortgage loans of 75.5 million, and U.S. Treasury securities of 252.7 million. As of September 30, 2024, outstanding indebtedness under repos was 346.2 million for Agency RMBS, 2.0 billion for credit portfolio assets, 55.6 million of reverse mortgage loans, and 256.3 million for U.S. Treasury securities. As of December 31, 2023 indebtedness outstanding on our repos was approximately 3.0 billion. As of December 31, 2023, our assets financed with repos consisted of Agency RMBS of 1.2 billion, credit portfolio assets of 2.1 billion, reverse mortgage loans of 203.7 million, and U.S. Treasury securities of 154.6 million. As of December 31, 2023, outstanding indebtedness under repos was 1.1 billion for Agency RMBS, 1.6 billion for credit portfolio assets, 150.2 million on reverse mortgage loans, and 155.0 million for U.S. Treasury securities.

 Equity 
 As of September 30, 2024, our equity increased by 90.0 million to 1.626 billion from 1.536 billion as of December 31, 2023. The increase principally consisted of net income of 117.4 million; net proceeds from the issuance of shares of common stock of 99.6 million, after commissions and offering costs; and contributions from our non-controlling interests of 10.0 million. These increases were partially offset by common and preferred dividends of 125.5 million, distributions to non-controlling interests of 9.1 million, payments of 1.8 million related to the cancellation of employee stock options, purchases of non-controlling interests of 0.7 million, and repurchases of common stock of 0.7 million.

 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Stockholders 
 For the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 we had net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders of 16.2 million, compared to 6.6 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. The increase in our results of operations was primarily due to increases in total other income and net interest income, along with earnings from investments in unconsolidated entities in the current period, as compared to losses from investments in unconsolidated entities in the prior period. These increases in our results of operations were partially offset by an increase in total expenses in the current period. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income was 107.3 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 96.2 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. Interest income includes coupon payments received and accrued on our holdings, the net accretion and amortization of purchase discounts and premiums on various holdings, and interest on our cash balances, including those balances held by our counterparties as collateral. 
 Investment Portfolio 
 Interest income from our investment portfolio segment for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 increased to 91.2 million, as compared to 89.4 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023.

 (1) Amounts exclude interest income on cash and cash equivalents (including when posted as margin) and long positions in U.S. Treasury securities. 
 For the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, interest income from our credit portfolio was 80.5 million, as compared to 75.4 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. This period-over-period increase was due to higher average asset yields and the larger size of the credit portfolio for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024. 
 For the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, interest income from our Agency RMBS was 5.4 million, as compared to 10.5 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. This period-over-period decrease was due to the significantly smaller size of the Agency portfolio, which was partially offset by higher average asset yields for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024. 
 Some of the variability in our interest income and portfolio yields is due to the Catch-up Amortization Adjustment. For the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had a positive Catch-up Amortization Adjustment of 0.5 million and 0.3 million, respectively, which increased our interest income. Excluding the Catch-up Amortization Adjustment, the weighted average yield of our Agency portfolio and our total portfolio was 4.23 and 7.07 , respectively, for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024. Excluding the Catch-up Amortization Adjustment, the weighted average yield of our Agency portfolio and our total portfolio was 3.90 and 6.58 , respectively, for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. 
 In addition, we had 4.3 million and 3.0 million of interest income related to long U.S. Treasury securities and reverse repo on short positions in U.S. Treasury securities for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which we generally use to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates. 
 Longbridge 
 For the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, interest income from the Longbridge segment was 14.6 million and 5.2 million, respectively. The increase was primarily related to a larger average holdings of proprietary reverse mortgage loans period over period as well as an increase in interest income related to reverse repo on short positions in U.S. Treasury securities for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024. 
 Corporate/Other 
 For the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, interest income not allocated to either the investment portfolio segment or Longbridge segment, typically interest income earned on cash balances and cash collateral held by counterparties, was 1.5 million and 1.6 million, respectively. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense primarily includes interest on funds borrowed under repos and Total other secured borrowings, interest on our unsecured borrowings, coupon interest on securities sold short, the related net accretion and amortization of purchase discounts and premiums on those short holdings, and interest on our counterparties' cash collateral held by us. For the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had total interest expense of 73.7 million and 68.7 million, respectively. 
 Investment Portfolio 
 Total interest expense in our investment portfolio segment decreased to 55.3 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 58.0 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in interest expense was primarily the result of a decline in average secured borrowings on our Agency RMBS assets, partially offset by an increase in financing rates.

 Among other instruments, we use interest rate swaps to hedge against the risk of rising interest rates. If we were to include as a component of our cost of funds the actual and accrued periodic payments on our interest rate swaps used to hedge our assets, our total average cost of funds would decrease to 4.48 and 3.86 for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Excluding the Catch-up Amortization Adjustment, our net interest margin, defined as the average yield on our portfolio of yield-bearing targeted assets less the average cost of funds on our secured borrowings (including actual and accrued periodic payments on interest rate swaps as described above), was 2.59 and 2.72 for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These metrics do not include costs associated with any unsecured debt or costs associated with other instruments that we use to hedge interest rate risk, such as TBAs and futures. 
 Longbridge 
 Interest expense in the Longbridge segment primarily relates to Other secured borrowings and repurchase agreements. For the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, interest expense related to the Longbridge segment was 13.9 million and 7.5 million, respectively. The increase in interest expense in the current period was primarily due to a significant increase in the average size of borrowings on the Longbridge portfolio, partially offset by lower average financing rates. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, our average borrowings related to the Longbridge portfolio were 621.7 million, and our average cost of funds was 7.88 . This compares to average borrowings of 307.3 million and an average cost of funds of 8.82 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. 
 Corporate/Other 
 Certain items of interest expense are not allocated to either the investment portfolio segment or Longbridge segment, such as interest expense on our Unsecured borrowings and certain cash collateral held by us. Total interest expense not allocated to either the investment portfolio or Longbridge segments increased to 4.5 million as compared to 3.1 million for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This increase was primarily due to interest expense incurred on unsecured borrowings assumed by us as a result of the completion of the Arlington Merger in the fourth quarter of 2023.

 Base Management Fees 
 Corporate/Other 
 For the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, the gross base management fee, which is based on total equity at the end of each quarter, was 6.1 million, and our Manager credited us with rebates on our base management fee of 0.1 million, resulting in a net base management fee of 6.0 million. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, the gross base management fee was 5.0 million, and our Manager credited us with rebates on our base management fee of 0.1 million, resulting in a net base management fee of 4.9 million. The increase in the net base management fee period over period was primarily due to a larger capital base at the end of the third quarter of 2024, as compared to 2023. 
 Other Investment Related Expenses 
 Other investment related expenses consist of servicing fees on our mortgage and consumer loans, as well as various other expenses and fees directly related to our financial assets and certain financial liabilities carried at fair value. For the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, other investment related expenses were 15.7 million and 9.6 million, respectively. 
 Investment Portfolio 
 For the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Other investment related expenses in our investment portfolio segment were 4.1 million and 2.3 million, respectively. The increase in Other investment related expenses was primarily due to an increase in servicing expenses on our larger residential mortgage loan portfolio as well as an increase in various legal and due diligence expenses on newly originated loans we purchase. 
 Longbridge 
 Other investment related expenses in the Longbridge segment primarily consist of servicing expense related to reverse mortgage loans and various loan origination expenses. For the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Other investment related expenses were 11.5 million and 7.3 million, respectively. The increase in Other investment related expenses in the Longbridge segment was primarily due to debt issuance costs incurred in connection with a securitization of proprietary reverse mortgage loans during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, as well as an increase in servicing and various loan origination expenses resulting from our larger holdings and originations of reverse mortgage loans. 
 Other Operating Expenses 
 Other operating expenses consist of professional fees, compensation and benefit expenses related to our dedicated or partially dedicated personnel, and various other operating expenses necessary to run our business. Other operating expenses exclude management and incentive fees, interest expense, and other investment related expenses. Other operating expenses were 29.2 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 25.0 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. 
 Investment Portfolio 
 Other operating expenses for our investment portfolio segment were 1.4 million for each of the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Longbridge 
 For the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, other operating expenses related to the Longbridge segment were 22.3 million and 18.0 million, respectively. These expenses primarily consist of compensation and benefits expense, and consist to a lesser extent of various overhead costs including rent expense, licensing fees, expenses related to office equipment, and amortization of intangible assets. The period-over-period increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits expense.

 Other Income (Loss) 
 Other income (loss) consists of net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on securities and residential mortgage, commercial mortgage, consumer, and corporate loans, financial derivatives, and real estate owned, unrealized gains (losses) on other secured borrowings, at fair value and Unsecured borrowings, at fair value, net change from HECM reverse mortgage loans, at fair value, and net change related to HMBS obligations, at fair value. Other, net, another component of Other income (loss), includes rental income and income related to loan originations, as well as income on MSRs and Forward MSR-related investments, unrealized gains (losses) on loan commitments, realized gains (losses) on foreign currency transactions, and unrealized gains (losses) on foreign currency remeasurement. 
 Investment Portfolio 
 For the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, other income (loss) was 6.5 million, consisting primarily of net realized and unrealized gains of 98.5 million on our securities and loans, partially offset by net realized and unrealized losses of (58.0) million on our Other secured borrowings, at fair value, (31.0) million on our financial derivatives, (1.8) million of Other, net, and (1.2) million on real estate owned, net. Net realized and unrealized gains of 98.5 million on our securities and loans were primarily on non-QM loans, non-Agency RMBS, closed-end second lien loans, and non-Agency CMBS, all primarily driven by lower interest rates. These gains were partially offset by net realized and unrealized losses on commercial mortgage bridge loans and consumer loans. We recognized net unrealized losses of (58.0) million on our Other secured borrowings, at fair value for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, related to borrowings on our securitized non-QM loans. These securitized non-QM loans had net unrealized gains of 62.5 million, which are included in Unrealized gains (losses) on securities and loans, net. Net realized and unrealized losses of (31.0) million on our financial derivatives were primarily related to net realized and unrealized losses, driven by lower interest rates, on our interest rate swaps, and to a lesser extent, on our TBAs and on our short positions in U.S. Treasury futures. Other, net of (1.8) million consisted primarily of net realized and unrealized losses on our Forward MSR-related investments, partially offset by various origination and loan income, and rental income. 
 For the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, other income (loss) was (12.0) million, consisting primarily of net realized and unrealized losses on our securities and loans of (77.3) million, partially offset by net realized and unrealized gains on our financial derivatives of 47.3 million and net unrealized gains of 18.7 million on our Other secured borrowings, at fair value. Net realized and unrealized losses of (77.3) million on our securities and loans primarily related to our non-QM loans and Agency RMBS, driven by higher interest rates, as well as to our commercial whole loans and ABS backed by consumer loans. Such losses were partially offset by net realized and unrealized gains of 47.3 million on our financial derivatives, which primarily related to net gains on interest rate swaps, net short TBA positions, and futures, driven by higher interest rates. We recognized net unrealized gains of 18.7 million on our Other secured borrowings, at fair value for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, related to borrowings on our securitized non-QM loans. These securitized non-QM loans had net unrealized losses of (10.4) million, which are included in Unrealized gains (losses) on securities and loans, net. 
 Longbridge 
 For the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, other income (loss) from the Longbridge segment was 30.6 million, consisting primarily of gains from Net change from HECM reverse mortgage loans, at fair value of 158.6 million, net realized and unrealized gains of 16.1 million on securities and loans, other income of 3.4 million, and net unrealized gains of 1.9 million on Other Secured borrowings, at fair value. These gains were partially offset by Net change related to HMBS obligations, at fair value of (133.8) million and net realized and unrealized losses of (15.5) million on financial derivatives. Gains from Net change from HECM reverse mortgage loans at fair value of 158.6 million primarily consisted of 149.2 million of coupon income on HECM loans and net realized and unrealized gains of 10.3 million on HECM loans. The net realized and unrealized gains on HECM loans were primarily driven by a decline in interest rate quarter over quarter. Losses from Net change related to HMBS obligations, at fair value of (133.8) million primarily consisted of (140.4) million of interest expense on the HMBS obligations and net unrealized gains of 6.5 million on the HMBS obligations, which partially offset the interest income on HECM loans and net realized and unrealized gains on HECM loans. Net gains of 16.1 million on securities and loans were primarily driven by tighter yield spreads on proprietary reverse mortgage loans. Other income, included in Other, net of 3.4 million, is primarily related to 2.1 million of servicing fees and 2.5 million of origination fees, partially offset by net realized and unrealized losses of (0.7) million on MSRs. 
 For the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, other income (loss) from the Longbridge segment was 31.8 million, consisting primarily of gains from Net change from reverse mortgage loans, at fair value of 99.9 million, realized and unrealized gains on financial derivatives of 23.9 million, and other income of 27.5 million primarily related to MSRs.

 gains were partially offset by Net change related to HMBS obligations, at fair value of (115.7) million. Gains from Net change from reverse mortgage loans, at fair value of 99.9 million consisted primarily of coupon income on HECM loans of 130.5 million, offset by a mark-to-market losses of (30.3) million due to our adoption of more conservative valuation assumptions in light of current market conditions. Losses from Net change related to HMBS obligations, at fair value of (115.7) million consists primarily of interest expenses of the HMBS obligation. Other income of 27.5 million is primarily related to unrealized gains of 23.9 million on the MSRs acquired out of a bankruptcy proceeding in July 2023, and 2.2 million of servicing fees. 
 Corporate/Other 
 For the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, other income (loss) was (3.8) million, consisting primarily of a net loss on our Unsecured borrowings, at fair value of (9.1) million, driven by the decrease in interest rates. This net loss was partially offset by net gains of 5.2 million, primarily on the fixed receiver interest rate swaps that we use to hedge the fixed payments on both our unsecured long-term debt and our preferred equity, also driven by the decline in interest rates. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, other income (loss) was 6.4 million, consisting primarily of net realized and unrealized gains on the fixed payer interest rate swaps associated with the then-pending merger with Great Ajax Corp., partially offset by net realized and unrealized losses on the fixed receiver interest rate swaps that we use to hedge the fixed payments on both our Unsecured borrowings, at fair value and our preferred equity, and net unrealized losses on our outstanding Unsecured borrowings, at fair value.

 We have elected the fair value option for our equity investments in unconsolidated entities. Earnings (losses) from investments in unconsolidated entities was 7.3 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to (1.0) million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, Earnings (losses) from investments in unconsolidated entities of 7.3 million primarily consisted of net realized and unrealized gains on investments in loan originators, investments in entities holding commercial mortgage loans and REO, in which we co-invest with other Ellington affiliates, and investments in risk retention vehicles related to non-QM securitizations. Losses from investments in unconsolidated entities of (1.0) million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, primarily related to net unrealized losses on investments in the risk retention vehicles holding tranches of non-consolidated Ellington-sponsored non-QM securitizations in which we have participated, and risk retention vehicles related to unconsolidated consumer securitizations. Such losses were partially offset by net realized and unrealized gains from investments in entities holding commercial mortgage loans and REO, in which we co-invest with other Ellington affiliates.

 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Stockholders 
 For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 we had net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders of 95.4 million, compared to 48.4 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. The increase in our results of operations was primarily due to increases in total other income and net interest income, along with earnings from investments in unconsolidated entities in the current period, as compared to losses from investments in unconsolidated entities in the prior period. These increases were partially offset by an increase in total expenses and dividends on preferred stock. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income was 309.3 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 271.5 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. Interest income includes coupon payments received and accrued on our holdings, the net accretion and amortization of purchase discounts and premiums on various holdings, and interest on our cash balances, including those balances held by our counterparties as collateral. 
 Investment Portfolio 
 Interest income from our investment portfolio segment for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 increased to 271.4 million, as compared to 254.9 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023.

 (1) Amounts exclude interest income on cash and cash equivalents (including when posted as margin) and long positions in U.S. Treasury securities. 
 For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, interest income from our credit portfolio was 239.5 million, as compared to 218.9 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. This period-over-period increase was primarily driven by higher average asset yields for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. 
 For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, interest income from our Agency RMBS was 19.4 million and 25.4 million, respectively. This period-over-period decrease was due to the significantly smaller size of the Agency portfolio, partially offset by higher average asset yields for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. 
 Some of the variability in our interest income and portfolio yields is due to the Catch-up Amortization Adjustment. For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had a negative Catch-up Amortization Adjustment of (0.1) million and (0.6) million, respectively, which decreased our interest income. Excluding the Catch-up Amortization Adjustment, the weighted average yield of our Agency portfolio and our total portfolio was 4.21 and 7.05 , respectively, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. Excluding the Catch-up Amortization Adjustment, the weighted average yield of our Agency portfolio and our total portfolio was 3.51 and 6.31 , respectively, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. 
 In addition, we had 9.8 million and 9.0 million of interest income related to long U.S. Treasury securities and reverse repo on short U.S. Treasury securities for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which we generally use to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates. 
 Longbridge 
 For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, interest income from the Longbridge segment was 32.6 million and 11.9 million, respectively. The increase was primarily related to a larger average portfolio of proprietary reverse mortgage loans period over period as well as an increase in interest income related to reverse repo on short positions in U.S. Treasury securities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. 
 Corporate/Other 
 For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, interest income not allocated to either the investment portfolio segment or the Longbridge segment was 5.3 million and 4.7 million, respectively. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense primarily includes interest on funds borrowed under repos and Total other secured borrowings, interest on our unsecured borrowings, coupon interest on securities sold short, the related net accretion and amortization of purchase discounts and premiums on those short holdings, and interest on our counterparties' cash collateral held by us. For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had total interest expense of 211.0 million and 191.8 million, respectively. 
 Investment Portfolio 
 Total interest expense in our investment portfolio segment increased to 166.2 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 164.4 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense was primarily the result of an increase in financing rates as well as a larger short position in U.S. Treasury securities, which we use to hedge interest rate risk. Such increases were partially offset by a decline in average secured borrowings on our credit and Agency RMBS assets.

 Among other instruments, we use interest rate swaps to hedge against the risk of rising interest rates. If we were to include as a component of our cost of funds the actual and accrued periodic payments on our interest rate swaps used to hedge our assets, our total average cost of funds would decrease to 4.40 and 3.80 for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Excluding the Catch-up Amortization Adjustment, our net interest margin, defined as the average yield on our portfolio of yield-bearing targeted assets less the average cost of funds on our secured borrowings (including actual and accrued periodic payments on interest rate swaps as described above), was 2.65 and 2.51 for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These metrics do not include costs associated with any unsecured debt or costs associated with other instruments that we use to hedge interest rate risk, such as TBAs and futures. 
 Longbridge 
 Interest expense in the Longbridge segment primarily relates to Other secured borrowings and repurchase agreements. For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, interest expense related to the Longbridge segment was 31.0 million and 18.0 million, respectively. The increase in interest expense in the current period was primarily due to a significant increase in the average size of borrowings on the Longbridge portfolio, partially offset by a decrease in financing costs. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, our average borrowings related to the Longbridge portfolio were 488.7 million and our average cost of funds was 8.05 . This compares to average borrowings of 283.5 million and an average cost of funds of 8.49 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. 
 Corporate/Other 
 Certain items of interest expense are not allocated to either the investment portfolio segment or the Longbridge segment, such as interest expense on our Unsecured borrowings and certain cash collateral held by us. Total interest expense not allocated to either the investment portfolio segment or the Longbridge segment was 13.7 million and 9.4 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This increase was primarily due to interest expense incurred on unsecured borrowings assumed by us as a result of the completion of the Arlington Merger in the fourth quarter of 2023.

 Base Management Fees 
 Corporate/Other 
 For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the gross base management fee, which is based on total equity at the end of each quarter, was 17.8 million, and our Manager credited us with rebates on our base management fee of 0.2 million, resulting in a net base management fee of 17.6 million. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, the gross base management fee was 15.1 million, and our Manager credited us with rebates on our base management fee of 0.4 million, resulting in a net base management fee of 14.8 million. The increase in the net base management fee period over period was due to a larger capital base at the end of each quarter in 2024, as compared to 2023. 
 Other Investment Related Expenses 
 Other investment related expenses consist of servicing fees on our mortgage and consumer loans, as well as various other expenses and fees directly related to our financial assets and certain financial liabilities carried at fair value. For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, other investment related expenses were 40.0 million and 27.7 million, respectively. 
 Investment Portfolio 
 For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Other investment related expenses in our investment portfolio segment were 10.4 million and 6.8 million, respectively. The increase in Other investment related expenses was primarily due to an increase in servicing expense on our larger residential mortgage loan portfolio as well as an increase in various legal and due diligence expenses on newly originated loans we purchase. 
 Longbridge 
 Other investment related expenses related to the Longbridge segment primarily consist of servicing expense related to reverse mortgage loans and various loan origination expenses. For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Other investment related expenses were 29.6 million and 20.9 million, respectively. The increase in Other investment related expenses in the Longbridge segment was primarily due to debt issuance costs incurred in connection with two securitizations of proprietary reverse mortgage loans in 2024, as well as an increase in servicing and various loan origination expenses resulting from our larger holdings and originations of reverse mortgage loans. 
 Other Operating Expenses 
 Other operating expenses consist of professional fees, compensation and benefit expenses related to our dedicated or partially dedicated personnel, and various other operating expenses necessary to run our business. Other operating expenses exclude management and incentive fees, interest expense, and other investment related expenses.

 Investment Portfolio 
 Other operating expenses in our investment portfolio segment were 3.6 million and 4.4 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in other operating expenses for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was due to a decrease in compensation and benefits expense. 
 Longbridge 
 For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, other operating expenses related to the Longbridge segment were 60.1 million and 55.7 million, respectively. These expenses primarily consist of compensation and benefits expense, and consist to a lesser extent of various overhead costs including rent expense, licensing fees, expenses related to office equipment, and amortization of intangible assets. The period-over-period increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits expenses and technology expenses, which were partially offset by a decline in professional fees.

 Other Income (Loss) 
 Other income (loss) consists of net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on securities and residential mortgage, commercial mortgage, consumer, and corporate loans, financial derivatives, and real estate owned, unrealized gains (losses) on other secured borrowings, at fair value and Unsecured borrowings, at fair value, net change from HECM reverse mortgage loans, at fair value, and net change related to HMBS obligations, at fair value.

These gains were partially offset by net unrealized losses of (71.7) million on our Other secured borrowings, at fair value, and net realized and unrealized losses of (4.2) million on real estate owned, net. Net realized and unrealized gains of 110.8 million on our securities and loans were primarily on non-QM loans and Agency and non-Agency RMBS, primarily due to a combination of lower interest rates and yield spread tightening. These gains were partially offset by net realized and unrealized losses on residential transition loans and consumer loans. Net realized and unrealized gains of 5.8 million on our financial derivatives were primarily related to net realized and unrealized gains on our interest rate swaps, and to a lesser extent, on our TBAs, driven by higher interest rates during the first half of the year. These net gains on our financial derivatives for the first half of 2024 were partially offset by net losses in the third quarter, driven by declining interest rates during that quarter. Other, net of 3.5 million consisted primarily of origination and loan income, rental income, and income and net realized and unrealized gains on our Forward MSR-related investment. We recognized net unrealized losses of (71.7) million on our Other secured borrowings, at fair value for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, related to borrowings on our securitized non-QM loans. These securitized non-QM loans had net unrealized gains of 79.4 million, which are included in Unrealized gains (losses) on securities and loans, net.

Net realized and unrealized gains of 61.8 million on our financial derivatives were primarily related to net realized and unrealized gains on interest rate swaps, net short positions in TBAs, and futures, which were driven by higher interest rates. Such gains were partially offset by net realized and unrealized losses on credit default swaps on corporate bond indices. We also recognized net unrealized gains of 1.1 million on our Other secured borrowings, at fair value for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, related to borrowings on our securitized non-QM loans. These securitized non-QM loans had net unrealized gains of 19.2 million, which are included in Unrealized gains (losses) on securities and loans, net. Net realized and unrealized losses of (53.3) million on our securities and loans were primarily on Agency RMBS, non-Agency RMBS and CMBS, ABS backed by consumer loans, and net short positions in U.S. Treasury securities. These losses were partially offset by net realized and unrealized gains on non-QM loans. 
 Longbridge 
 For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, other income (loss) from the Longbridge segment was 98.7 million, consisting primarily of gains from Net change from HECM reverse mortgage loans, at fair value of 510.8 million, 13.2 million of Other, net, net gains of 9.5 million on securities and loans, net gains of 3.1 million on financial derivatives, and net gains of 1.5 million on Other secured borrowings, at fair value. These gains were partially offset by Net change related to HMBS obligations, at fair value of (439.5) million. Net change from HECM reverse mortgage loans at fair value of 510.8 million primarily consisted of 432.8 million of coupon income on HECM loans and net realized and unrealized gains of 85.0 million on HECM loans. The net realized and unrealized gains on the HECM loans were primarily driven by tighter yield spreads of HECM loans. Net change related to HMBS obligations, at fair value of (439.5) million primarily consisted of (407.3) million of interest expense on the HMBS obligations and net unrealized losses of (32.2) million on the HMBS obligations, which partially offset the interest income and net realized and unrealized gains on HECM loans. Other income, included in Other, net of 13.2 million, is primarily related to 6.7 million of origination fees and 6.4 million of servicing fees. Net gains of 9.5 million on securities and loans were primarily driven by tighter yield spreads of proprietary reverse mortgage loans.

 We calculate Adjusted Distributable Earnings as U.S. GAAP net income (loss) as adjusted for: (i) realized and unrealized gain (loss) on securities and loans, REO, mortgage servicing rights, financial derivatives (excluding periodic settlements on interest rate swaps), any borrowings carried at fair value, and foreign currency transactions; (ii) incentive fee to affiliate; (iii) Catch-up Amortization Adjustment (as defined below); (iv) non-cash equity compensation expense; (v) provision for income taxes; (vi) certain non-capitalized transaction costs; and (vii) other income or loss items that are of a non-recurring nature. For certain investments in unconsolidated entities, we include the relevant components of net operating income in Adjusted Distributable Earnings. The Catch-up Amortization Adjustment is a quarterly adjustment to premium amortization or discount accretion triggered by changes in actual and projected prepayments on our Agency RMBS (accompanied by a corresponding offsetting adjustment to realized and unrealized gains and losses). The adjustment is calculated as of the beginning of each quarter based on our then-current assumptions about cashflows and prepayments, and can vary significantly from quarter to quarter. Non-capitalized transaction costs include expenses, generally professional fees, incurred in connection with the acquisition of an investment or issuance of long-term debt. We also include in Adjusted Distributable Earnings, for all loans that we originate through Longbridge, any realized and unrealized gains (losses) on such loans up to the point of loan sale or securitization, net of sale or securitization costs.

 Adjusted Distributable Earnings is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted Distributable Earnings provides information useful to investors, because: (i) we believe that it is a useful indicator of both current and projected long-term financial performance, in that it excludes the impact of certain current-period earnings components that we believe are less useful in forecasting long-term performance and dividend-paying ability; (ii) we use it to evaluate the effective net yield provided by our investment portfolio, after the effects of financial leverage and by Longbridge, to reflect the earnings from its reverse mortgage origination and servicing operations; and (iii) we believe that presenting Adjusted Distributable Earnings assists investors in measuring and evaluating our operating performance, and comparing our operating performance to that of our residential mortgage REIT and mortgage originator peers. Please note, however, that: (I) our calculation of Adjusted Distributable Earnings may differ from the calculation of similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures by our peers, with the result that these non-GAAP financial measures might not be directly comparable; and (II) Adjusted Distributable Earnings excludes certain items that may impact the amount of cash that is actually available for distribution. 
 In addition, because Adjusted Distributable Earnings is an incomplete measure of our financial results and differs from net income (loss) computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, it should be considered supplementary to, and not as a substitute for, net income (loss) computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 Furthermore, Adjusted Distributable Earnings is different from REIT taxable income. As a result, the determination of whether we have met the requirement to distribute at least 90 of our annual REIT taxable income (subject to certain adjustments) to our stockholders, in order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, is not based on whether we distributed 90 of our Adjusted Distributable Earnings. 
 In setting our dividends, our Board of Directors considers our earnings, liquidity, financial condition, REIT distribution requirements, and financial covenants, along with other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant from time to time.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity refers to our ability to generate and obtain adequate amounts of cash to meet our requirements, including repaying our borrowings, funding and maintaining positions in our targeted assets, making distributions in the form of dividends, and other general business needs. Our short-term (the 12 months following period end) and long-term (beyond 12 months from period end) liquidity requirements include acquisition costs for assets we acquire, payment of our base management fee and incentive fee, compliance with margin requirements under our repos, reverse repos, and financial derivative contracts, repayment of repo borrowings and other secured borrowings to the extent we are unable or unwilling to extend such borrowings, payment of our general operating expenses, payment of interest payments on our unsecured borrowings, and payment of our dividends. Our capital resources primarily include cash on hand, cash flow from our investments (including principal and interest payments received on our investments and proceeds from the sale of investments), borrowings under repos and other secured borrowings, and proceeds from equity and debt offerings. We expect that these sources of funds will be sufficient to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity needs. 
 We held cash and cash equivalents of approximately 217.7 million and 228.9 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 The following summarizes our borrowings under repos by remaining maturity: 
 (In thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Remaining Days to Maturity Outstanding Borrowings of Total Outstanding Borrowings of Total 30 Days or Less 1,300,426 49.2 1,356,343 45.7 31 - 60 Days 134,170 5.1 152,220 5.1 61 - 90 Days 103,606 3.9 83,906 2.8 91 - 120 Days 171,032 6.5 290,215 9.8 121 - 150 Days 49,053 1.9 151 - 180 Days 15,892 0.6 7,911 0.3 181 - 364 Days 143,800 5.4 1,018,211 34.3 > 364 Days 724,073 27.4 58,631 2.0 2,642,052 100.0 2,967,437 100.0 
 Repos involving underlying investments that were sold prior to period end for settlement following period end, are shown using their contractual maturity dates even though such repos may be expected to be terminated early upon settlement of the sale of the underlying investment. 
 The amounts borrowed under our repo agreements are generally subject to the application of "haircuts." A haircut is the percentage discount that a repo lender applies to the market value of an asset serving as collateral for a repo borrowing, for the purpose of determining whether such repo borrowing is adequately collateralized. As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average contractual haircut applicable to the assets that serve as collateral for our outstanding repo borrowings was 22.8 with respect to credit portfolio assets, 18.3 with respect to reverse mortgage loans, 5.6 with respect to Agency RMBS assets, and 19.1 overall. As of December 31, 2023, the weighted average contractual haircuts were 26.7 with respect to credit portfolio assets, 21.5 with respect to reverse mortgage loans, 5.1 with respect to Agency RMBS assets, and 18.3 overall. 
 We expect to continue to borrow funds in the form of repos as well as other similar types of financings. The terms of our repo borrowings are predominantly governed by master repurchase agreements, which generally conform to the terms in the standard master repurchase agreement as published by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association as to repayment and margin requirements. In addition, each lender may require that we include supplemental terms and conditions to the standard master repurchase agreement. Typical supplemental terms and conditions include the addition of or changes to provisions relating to margin calls, net asset value requirements, cross default provisions, certain key person events, changes in corporate structure, and requirements that all controversies related to the repurchase agreement be litigated in a particular jurisdiction. These provisions may differ for each of our repo lenders.

 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 2.6 billion and 3.0 billion of borrowings outstanding under our repos, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining terms on our repos ranged from 1 day to 655 days, with a weighted average remaining term of 153 days. Our repo borrowings were with a total of 23 counterparties as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, our repos had interest rates ranging from 4.37 to 8.42 , with a weighted average borrowing rate of 6.69 . As of December 31, 2023, the remaining terms on our repos ranged from 2 days to 513 days, with a weighted average remaining term of 126 days. Our repo borrowings were with a total of 26 counterparties as of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, our repos had interest rates ranging from 4.81 to 8.68 , with a weighted average borrowing rate of 6.67 . Investments transferred as collateral under repos had an aggregate fair value of 3.3 billion and 3.7 billion, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. It is expected that amounts due upon maturity of our repos will be funded primarily through the roll/re-initiation of repos and, if we are unable or unwilling to roll/re-initiate our repos, through free cash and proceeds from the sale of securities. 
 The following table details total outstanding borrowings, average outstanding borrowings, and the maximum outstanding borrowings at any month end for each quarter under repos for the past twelve quarters:

 (1) During this quarter, our borrowings decreased as the size of our investment portfolio decreased driven primarily by our participation in a non-QM securitization in February 2023. 
 In addition to our borrowings under repos, we have entered into various other types of transactions to finance certain of our investments, including non-QM loans and REO, European residential mortgage loans, commercial mortgage loans, consumer loans and ABS backed by consumer loans, reverse mortgage loans, and Reverse MSRs; such transactions are accounted for as secured borrowings. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had outstanding borrowings related to such transactions in the amount of 2.1 billion and 1.7 billion, respectively, which is reflected under the captions "Other secured borrowings" and "Other secured borrowings, at fair value" on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of assets collateralizing our Total other secured borrowings was 2.4 billion and 1.9 billion, respectively. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, as an HMBS issuer, we had HMBS-related obligations of 8.8 billion collateralized by 8.9 billion of HMBS assets and as of December 31, 2023, we had HMBS-related obligations of 8.4 billion collateralized by 8.5 billion of HMBS assets; HMBS assets include HECM loans as well as REO and claims and other receivables. See Note 14 in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information on our other secured borrowings and HMBS-related obligations. 
 As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 297.7 million of outstanding unsecured borrowings. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our outstanding unsecured borrowings were comprised of 210.0 million of 5.875 Senior Notes due April 2027, 34.9 million of 6.75 Senior Notes due March 2025, 37.8 million of 6.00 Senior Notes due August 2026, and 15.0 million of unregistered junior subordinated unsecured debt securities, the "Trust Preferred Debt." The Trust Preferred Debt includes 10.0 million which accrues and requires the payment of interest quarterly at three-month term SOFR plus 3.26 and which matures on October 7, 2033, and 5.0 million which accrues and requires the payment of interest quarterly at three-month term SOFR plus 2.51 and which matures on July 7, 2035. See Note 14 in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further detail on our unsecured borrowings.

 As of September 30, 2024, we had an aggregate amount at risk under our repos with 23 counterparties of approximately 655.0 million, and as of December 31, 2023, we had an aggregate amount at risk under our repos with 27 counterparties of approximately 705.4 million. Amounts at risk represent the excess, if any, for each counterparty of the fair value of collateral held by such counterparty over the amounts outstanding under repos. If the amounts outstanding under repos with a particular counterparty are greater than the collateral held by the counterparty, there is no amount at risk for the particular counterparty. Amount at risk as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, does not include approximately 0.3 million and (0.6) million, respectively, of net accrued interest receivable (payable), which is defined as accrued interest on securities held as collateral less interest payable on cash borrowed. 
 Our derivatives are predominantly subject to bilateral master trade agreements or clearing in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act. We may be required to deliver or receive cash or securities as collateral upon entering into derivative transactions. Changes in the relative value of derivative transactions may require us or the counterparty to post or receive additional collateral. Entering into derivative contracts involves market risk in excess of amounts recorded on our balance sheet. In the case of cleared derivatives, the clearinghouse becomes our counterparty and the future commission merchant acts as an intermediary between us and the clearinghouse with respect to all facets of the related transaction, including the posting and receipt of required collateral. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had an aggregate amount at risk under our derivative contracts, excluding TBAs, with seven counterparties of approximately 48.2 million. We also had 44.5 million of initial margin for cleared over-the-counter, or "OTC," derivatives posted to central clearinghouses as of that date. As of December 31, 2023, we had an aggregate amount at risk under our derivatives contracts, excluding TBAs, with nine counterparties of approximately 65.6 million. We also had 56.9 million of initial margin for cleared OTC derivatives posted to central clearinghouses as of that date. Amounts at risk under our derivatives contracts represent the excess, if any, for each counterparty of the fair value of our derivative contracts plus our collateral held directly by the counterparty less the counterparty's collateral held by us. If a particular counterparty's collateral held by us is greater than the aggregate fair value of the financial derivatives plus our collateral held directly by the counterparty, there is no amount at risk for the particular counterparty. 
 We purchase and sell TBAs and Agency pass-through certificates on a when-issued or delayed delivery basis. The delayed delivery for these securities means that these transactions are more prone to market fluctuations between the trade date and the ultimate settlement date, and therefore are more vulnerable, especially in the absence of margining arrangements with respect to these transactions, to increasing amounts at risk with the applicable counterparties. As of September 30, 2024, in connection with our forward settling TBA and Agency pass-through certificates, we had an aggregate amount at risk with seven counterparties of approximately 3.9 million. As of December 31, 2023, in connection with our forward settling TBA and Agency pass-through certificates, we had an aggregate amount at risk with eight counterparties of approximately 12.9 million. Amounts at risk in connection with our forward settling TBA and Agency pass-through certificates represent the excess, if any, for each counterparty of the net fair value of the forward settling transactions plus our collateral held directly by the counterparty less the counterparty's collateral held by us. If a particular counterparty's collateral held by us is greater than the aggregate fair value of the forward settling transactions plus our collateral held directly by the counterparty, there is no amount at risk for the particular counterparty. 
 We have commenced an "at-the-market" offering for shares of our common stock, or the "Common ATM Program," by entering into equity distribution agreements with sales agents. Under the current equity distribution agreements, amended in September 2024, we are authorized to offer and sell up to 300.0 million of common stock from time to time. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, we issued 5,612,166 shares of common stock under the Common ATM Program, which provided 72.7 million of net proceeds after approximately 0.6 million of commissions and 0.5 million of offering costs. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, we issued 7,715,891 shares of common stock under the Common ATM Program, which provided 99.6 million of net proceeds after approximately 0.8 million of commissions and 0.6 million of offering costs. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, we issued 1,066,221 shares of common stock under the Common ATM Program, which provided 14.5 million of net proceeds after approximately 0.1 million of commissions and 41 thousand of offering costs. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, we issued 5,500,082 shares of common stock under the Common ATM Program, which provided 75.0 million of net proceeds after approximately 0.8 million of commissions and 0.2 million of offering costs. As of September 30, 2024, we had remaining authorization under the Common ATM Program to issue 300.0 million of common stock. 
 On January 20, 2022, we commenced an "at-the-market" offering for our Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, or the "Preferred ATM Program," by entering into equity distribution agreements with third party sales agents under which we are authorized to offer and sell up to 100.0 million of 6.750 Series A Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, 0.001 par value per share ("Series A Preferred Stock") and/or 6.250 Series B Fixed-Rate Reset Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, 0.001 par value per share ("Series B Preferred Stock") from time to time. As of September 30, 2024, we had remaining authorization under the Preferred ATM Program to issue 99.5 million of common

 stock. We did not issue any preferred stock under the Preferred ATM Program during the three- or nine-month month periods ended September 30, 2024. 
 On February 6, 2023, we issued 4,000,000 shares of Series C Fixed-Rate Reset Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, 0.001 par value per share ("Series C Preferred Stock"), for proceeds of 96.5 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs of 3.5 million. Holders of the Series C Preferred Stock are entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends from and including the original issue date to, but excluding, April 30, 2028 (the "First Reset Date"), at a fixed rate equal to 8.625 per annum of the 25.00 per share liquidation preference. The applicable fixed rate resets on the First Reset Date and again on the fifth anniversary of the preceding reset date (each a "Reset Date"), at a rate equal to the five-year treasury rate as measured three business days prior to the Reset Date plus 5.13 per annum of the 25.00 per share liquidation preference. Dividends are payable quarterly in arrears on or about the 30th day of each January, April, July, and October. 
 In accordance with the terms of the Arlington Merger Agreement, on the closing date of the Arlington Merger, each outstanding share of Arlington's Class A common stock, par value 0.01 per share (other than shares held by us, EF Merger Sub Inc. or any of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, EF Merger Sub Inc. or Arlington) was automatically converted into the right to receive 0.3619 newly issued shares of common stock. In connection with the transactions completed pursuant to the Arlington Merger Agreement, 11,040,704 shares of our common stock were issued. In addition, in accordance with the terms of the Arlington Merger Agreement (i) each of the 379,668 outstanding shares of Arlington s 7.00 Series B Cumulative Perpetual Redeemable Preferred Stock, 0.01 par value per share, was automatically converted into the right to receive one newly issued share of our 7.000 Series D Preferred Stock, 0.001 par value per share ("Series D Preferred Stock"); and (ii) each of the 957,133 outstanding shares of Arlington s 8.250 Series C Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, 0.01 par value per share, was automatically converted into the right to receive one newly issued share of our 8.250 Series E Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, 0.001 par value per share ("Series E Preferred Stock"). 
 On March 21, 2023, our Board of Directors approved the adoption of a share repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to 50 million of common stock, or the "2023 Common Share Repurchase Program." The 2023 Common Share Repurchase Program extends our ability to repurchase beyond the share repurchase program adopted in 2018 under which we were authorized to repurchase up to 1.55 million shares of common stock, or the "2018 Common Share Repurchase Program." The 2023 Common Share Repurchase Program, which is open-ended in duration, allows us to make repurchases from time to time on the open market or in negotiated transactions, including under 10b5-1 plans. Repurchases are at our discretion, subject to applicable law, share availability, price and our financial performance, among other considerations. In addition to making discretionary repurchases, we from time to time use 10b5-1 plans to increase the number of trading days available to implement these repurchases. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 62,300 shares of common stock at an average price per share of 11.00 and a total cost of 0.7 million. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, the Company repurchased 1,084,336 shares at an average price per share of 11.39 and a total cost of 12.4 million. The Company did not repurchase any common shares during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we have authorization to repurchase an additional 45.1 million of common stock under the 2023 Common Share Repurchase Program. 
 On February 21, 2022, our Board of Directors approved the adoption of a share repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to 30.0 million of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, or the "Preferred Share Repurchase Program." The Preferred Share Repurchase Program, which is open-ended in duration, allows us to make repurchases from time to time on the open market or in negotiated transactions, including under 10b5-1 plans. Repurchases are at our discretion, subject to applicable law, share availability, price and our financial performance, among other considerations. We have not yet repurchased any shares of preferred stock under the Preferred Share Repurchase Program. 
 We may declare dividends based on, among other things, our earnings, our financial condition, the REIT qualification requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, our working capital needs and new opportunities. The declaration of dividends to our stockholders and the amount of such dividends are at the discretion of our Board of Directors.

 At those times when cash flows from the Company s operating activities are insufficient to fund its dividend payments, the Company funds such dividend payments through cash flows from its investing and/or financing activities, and in some cases from additional cash on hand. The following paragraphs summarize the Company s cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, our operating activities used net cash in the amount of 289.7 million and our investing activities used net cash in the amount of 106.9 million. Our repo activity used to finance many of our investments (including repayments of amounts borrowed under our repos) provided net cash of 122.1 million. We received 1.4 billion in proceeds from the issuance of Total other secured borrowings, and we used 1.3 billion for principal payments on our Total other secured borrowings. Thus our operating and investing activities, when combined with our repo financings and Other secured borrowings (net of repayments), used net cash of 169.0 million during the nine-month period ended

 September 30, 2024. We received proceeds from HMBS-related obligations of 1.0 billion and used 814.0 million for principal payments on HMBS-related obligations. We received proceeds from the issuance of common stock, net of underwriters' discounts, commissions, and offering costs paid, of 99.5 million and contributions from non-controlling interests of 9.6 million. We used 121.2 million to pay dividends, 9.1 million for distributions to non-controlling interests (our joint venture partners), 0.7 million to repurchase common stock, and 0.7 million to purchase non-controlling interests. As a result there was an decrease in our cash holdings of 2.2 million, from 230.5 million as of December 31, 2023 to 228.3 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, our operating activities used net cash in the amount of 162.9 million and our investing activities used net cash in the amount of 121.5 million. Our repo activity used to finance many of our investments (including repayments of amounts borrowed under our repos) provided net cash of 92.3 million. We received 1.32 billion in proceeds from the issuance of Total other secured borrowings, and we used 1.37 billion for principal payments on our Total other secured borrowings. Thus our operating and investing activities, when combined with our repo financings and Other secured borrowings (net of repayments), used net cash of 236.7 million during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. We received proceeds from HMBS-related obligations of 1.10 billion and used 954.4 million for principal payments on HMBS-related obligations. We received proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred stock, net of underwriters' discounts, commissions, and offering costs paid, of 171.4 million and contributions from non-controlling interests of 6.7 million. We used 107.2 million to pay dividends, 9.8 million for distributions to non-controlling interests (our joint venture partners), and 12.4 million to repurchase common stock. As a result there was a decrease in our cash holdings of 45.6 million, from 221.9 million as of December 31, 2022 to 176.3 million as of September 30, 2023. 
 Based on our current portfolio, amount of free cash on hand, debt-to-equity ratio, and current and anticipated availability of credit, we believe that our capital resources will be sufficient to enable us to meet anticipated short-term and long-term liquidity requirements. However, the unexpected inability to finance our Agency RMBS portfolio would create a serious short-term strain on our liquidity and would require us to liquidate much of that portfolio, which in turn would require us to restructure our portfolio to maintain our exclusion from registration as an investment company under the Investment Company Act and to maintain our qualification as a REIT. Steep declines in the values of our credit assets financed using repos, or in the values of our derivative contracts, would result in margin calls that would significantly reduce our free cash position. Furthermore, a substantial increase in prepayment rates on our assets financed by repos could cause a temporary liquidity shortfall, because we are generally required to post margin on such assets in proportion to the amount of the announced principal paydowns before the actual receipt of the cash from such principal paydowns. If our cash resources are at any time insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may have to sell assets or issue additional debt or equity securities. 
 Although we may from time to time enter into financing arrangements that limit our leverage, our investment guidelines do not limit the amount of leverage that we may use, and we believe that the appropriate leverage for the particular assets we hold depends on the credit quality and risk of those assets, as well as the general availability and terms of stable and reliable financing for those assets. 
 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 We are a party to a management agreement with our Manager. Pursuant to that agreement, our Manager is entitled to receive a base management fee, an incentive fee, reimbursement of certain expenses and, in certain circumstances, a termination fee. Such fees and expenses do not have fixed and determinable payments. For a description of the management agreement provisions, see Note 16 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 We have numerous contractual obligations and commitments related to our outstanding borrowings (see Note 14 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements) and related to our financial derivatives (see Note 10 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements). 
 See Note 24 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further detail on our other contractual obligations and commitments. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Further, we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitment to provide funding to any such entities that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or resources that would be material to an investor in our securities. As such, we are not materially exposed to any market, credit, liquidity, or financing risk

 that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. 
 Longbridge has a fiduciary responsibility related to escrow balances held in trust for borrowers' draws and other custodial funds due to servicing customers; as of September 30, 2024 the amount held in such accounts was 71.0 million. These funds, which do not represent assets or liabilities of the Company are maintained in segregated accounts at Longbridge, and accordingly, are not reflected on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 At September 30, 2024 we have not entered into any repurchase agreements for which delivery of the borrowed funds is not scheduled until after period end. 
 Inflation 
 Virtually all of our assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive in nature. As a result, interest rates and other factors generally influence our performance more than does inflation, although inflation rates often have a meaningful influence over the direction of interest rates, including influencing the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. In any event, our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost and/or fair market value without considering inflation. 
 In addition, elevated, long-term inflation could adversely impact the performance of our investment portfolio, or the prices of our investments, or both. For example, if higher inflation is not matched by an increase in wages, inflation could cause the real income of the borrowers on our residential and consumer loans to decline. In addition, in the case of borrowers on our commercial mortgage loans, net cash flow could decline if rents and/or expense reimbursements do not increase in kind with higher inflation. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 The primary components of our market risk at September 30, 2024 are related to credit risk, prepayment risk, and interest rate risk. We seek to actively manage these and other risks and to acquire and hold assets that we believe justify bearing those risks, and to maintain capital levels consistent with those risks. 
 Credit Risk 
 We are subject to credit risk in connection with many of our assets, especially non-Agency RMBS, CMBS, residential and commercial mortgage loans, proprietary reverse mortgage loans, corporate debt investments including CLOs and investments in securitization warehouses, and consumer loans. 
 Credit losses on real estate loans can occur for many reasons, including, but not limited to, poor origination practices, fraud, faulty appraisals, documentation errors, poor underwriting, legal errors, poor servicing practices, weak economic conditions, decline in the value of homes, businesses or commercial properties, special hazards, earthquakes and other natural events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or an outbreak of another highly infectious or contagious disease, over-leveraging of the borrower on a property, reduction in market rents and occupancy rates and poor property management services, changes in legal protections for lenders, reduction in personal income, job loss, and personal events such as divorce or health problems. Property values are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, national, regional, and local economic conditions (which may be adversely affected by industry slowdowns and other factors), local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of housing), changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments, construction quality, age and design, demographic factors, and retroactive changes to building or similar codes. 
 The ability of borrowers to repay consumer loans may be adversely affected by numerous borrower-specific factors, including unemployment, divorce, major medical expenses or personal bankruptcy. General factors, including an economic downturn, high energy costs or acts of God or terrorism, pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic or another highly infectious or contagious disease , may also affect the financial stability of borrowers and impair their ability or willingness to repay their loans. Whenever any of our consumer loans defaults, we are at risk of loss to the extent of any deficiency between the liquidation value of the collateral, if any, securing the loan, and the principal and accrued interest of the loan. Many of our consumer loans are unsecured, or are secured by collateral (such as an automobile) that depreciates rapidly; as a result, these loans may be at greater risk of loss than residential real estate loans. 
 Our corporate investments, especially our lower-rated or unrated CLO investments, corporate equity, and our investments in loan originators, have significant risk of loss, and our efforts to protect these investments may involve substantial costs and may not be successful. We also will be subject to significant uncertainty as to when and in what manner and for what value the corporate debt in which we directly or indirectly invest will eventually be satisfied (e.g., through liquidation of the obligor's assets, an exchange offer or plan of reorganization involving the debt securities or a payment of some amount in satisfaction of the obligation). In addition, these investments could involve loans to companies that are more likely to experience bankruptcy or similar financial distress, such as companies that are thinly capitalized, employ a high degree of financial leverage, are in

 highly competitive or risky businesses, are in a start-up phase, or are experiencing losses. 
 Similarly, we are exposed to the risk of potential credit losses on the other assets in our credit portfolio. For many of our investments, the two primary components of credit risk are default risk and severity risk. 
 Default Risk 
 Default risk is the risk that a borrower fails to make scheduled principal and interest payments on a mortgage loan or other debt obligation. We may attempt to mitigate our default risk by, among other things, opportunistically entering into credit default swaps and total return swaps. These instruments can reference various MBS indices, corporate bond indices, or corporate entities. We often rely on third-party servicers to mitigate our default risk, but such third-party servicers may have little or no economic incentive to mitigate loan default rates. 
 Severity Risk 
 Severity risk is the risk of loss upon a borrower default on a mortgage loan or other secured or unsecured debt obligation. Severity risk includes the risk of loss of value of the property or other asset, if any, securing the mortgage loan or debt obligation, as well as the risk of loss associated with taking over the property or other asset, if any, including foreclosure costs. We often rely on third-party servicers to mitigate our severity risk, but such third-party servicers may have little or no economic incentive to mitigate loan loss severities. In the case of mortgage loans, such mitigation efforts may include loan modification programs and prompt foreclosure and property liquidation following a default. Many of our consumer loans are unsecured, or are secured by collateral (such as an automobile) that depreciates rapidly; as a result, these loans may be at greater risk of loss than residential real estate loans. Pursuing any remaining deficiency following a default on a consumer loan is often difficult or impractical, especially when the borrower has a low credit score, making further substantial collection efforts unwarranted. In addition, repossessing personal property securing a consumer loan can present additional challenges, including locating and taking physical possession of the collateral. We rely on servicers who service these consumer loans, to, among other things, collect principal and interest payments on the loans and perform loss mitigation services, and these servicers may not perform in a manner that promotes our interests. In the case of corporate debt, if a company declares bankruptcy, the bankruptcy process has a number of significant inherent risks. Many events in a bankruptcy proceeding are the product of contested matters and adversarial proceedings and are beyond the control of the creditors. A bankruptcy filing by a company whose debt we have purchased may adversely and permanently affect such company. If the proceeding results in liquidation, the liquidation value of the company may have deteriorated significantly from what we believed to be the case at the time of our initial investment. The duration of a bankruptcy proceeding is also difficult to predict, and our return on investment can be adversely affected by delays until a plan of reorganization or liquidation ultimately becomes effective. A bankruptcy court may also re-characterize our debt investment as equity, and subordinate all or a portion of our claim to that of other creditors. This could occur even if our investment had initially been structured as senior debt. 
 Prepayment Risk 
 Prepayment risk is the risk of change, whether an increase or a decrease, in the rate at which principal is returned in respect of fixed-income assets in our portfolio, including both through voluntary prepayments and through liquidations due to defaults and foreclosures. Most significantly, our portfolio is exposed to the risk of changes in prepayment rates of mortgage loans, including the mortgage loans underlying our RMBS, Reverse MSRs and Forward MSR-related investments; and changes in prepayment rates of certain of our consumer loan, residential mortgage loan, and CLO holdings. This rate of prepayment is affected by a variety of factors, including the prevailing level of interest rates as well as economic, demographic, tax, social, legal, and other factors. Mortgage prepayment rates can be highly sensitive to changes in interest rates, but they are also affected by housing turnover, which can be driven by factors other than interest rates, including worker mobility and home price appreciation. Changes in prepayment rates will have varying effects on the different types of securities in our portfolio, and we attempt to take these effects into account in making asset management decisions. Increases in prepayment rates may cause us to experience both realized and unrealized losses on our interest only securities and inverse interest only securities, as these securities are extremely sensitive to prepayment rates. Conversely, decreases in prepayment rates on our loans and securities with below-market interest rates may cause the duration of such investments to extend, which may cause us to experience unrealized losses on such investments. Prepayment rates, besides being subject to interest rates and borrower behavior, are also substantially affected by government policy and regulation. For example, prepayment rates are generally lower in states with substantially higher mortgage recording taxes. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations, and other factors beyond our control. We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with most of our assets and liabilities. For some securities in our portfolio, the coupon interest rates on, and therefore also the values of, such securities are highly sensitive to interest rate movements, such as inverse floating rate RMBS,

 which benefit from falling interest rates. Whenever one of our repo borrowings matures, it will generally be replaced with a new repo borrowing based on market interest rates prevailing at such time. Subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT and our exclusion from registration under the Investment Company Act, we opportunistically hedge our interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swaps, TBAs, U.S. Treasury securities, Eurodollar futures, U.S. Treasury futures, and other instruments. In general, such hedging instruments are used to mitigate the interest rate risk arising from the mismatch between the duration of our financed assets and the duration of the liabilities used to finance such assets. 
 The following sensitivity analysis table shows the estimated impact on the value of our portfolio segregated by certain identified categories as of September 30, 2024, assuming a static portfolio and immediate and parallel shifts in interest rates from current levels as indicated below.

 The preceding analysis does not show sensitivity to changes in interest rates for instruments for which we believe that the effect of a change in interest rates is not material to the value of the overall portfolio and/or cannot be accurately estimated. In particular, this analysis excludes certain of our holdings of corporate securities and derivatives on corporate securities, and reflects only sensitivity to U.S. interest rates. 
 Our analysis of interest rate risk is derived from Ellington's proprietary models as well as third-party information and analytics. Many assumptions have been made in connection with the calculations set forth in the table above and, as such, there can be no assurance that assumed events will occur or that other events will not occur that would affect the outcomes. For example, for each hypothetical immediate shift in interest rates, assumptions have been made as to many important factors that can significantly and/or adversely affect the fair value of the instruments in our portfolio, including the response of mortgage prepayment rates, the shape of the yield curve, and market volatilities of interest rates. Furthermore, the fair value of each of the instruments comprising our portfolio is impacted by many other factors, each of which may or may not be correlated, or may only be loosely correlated, with interest rates. Depending on the nature of the instrument, these additional factors may include credit spreads, yield spreads, option-adjusted spreads, real estate prices, collateral adequacy, borrower creditworthiness, inflation, unemployment, general macroeconomic conditions, and other factors. For each instrument, our analysis makes many simplifying assumptions as to the response of these additional factors to shifts in interest rates, including that many if not most such factors are unaffected by such shifts. 
 The above analysis utilizes assumptions and estimates based on management's judgment and experience, and relies on financial models, which are inherently imperfect; in fact, different models can produce different results for the same instruments. While the table above reflects the estimated impacts of immediate parallel interest rate increases and decreases on specific categories of instruments in our portfolio, we actively trade many of the instruments in our portfolio, and therefore our current or future portfolios may have risks that differ significantly from those of our September 30, 2024 portfolio estimated above. Moreover, the impact of changing interest rates on fair value can change significantly when interest rates change by a greater amount than the hypothetical shifts assumed above. 
 For all of the foregoing reasons and others, the table above is for illustrative purposes only and actual changes in interest rates would likely cause changes in the actual fair value of our portfolio that would differ from those presented above, and such differences might be significant and/or adverse.

 Liquidity Risk 
 To fund our assets we may use a variety of debt alternatives in addition to equity capital that present us with liquidity risks. Certain of our assets are long-term fixed-rate assets, and we believe that liquidity risk arises from these assets with shorter-term variable rate borrowings. We seek to manage these risks, including by maintaining a prudent level of leverage, implementing interest rate hedges, maintaining sources of long-term financing, monitoring our liquidity position on a daily basis, monitoring the ongoing financial stability and future business plans of our financing counterparties, and maintaining a reasonable cushion of cash and unpledged real estate securities and loans in our portfolio in order to meet future margin calls. 
 We pledge assets, including mortgage loans or real estate securities, as collateral to secure most of our financing arrangements. However, should the value of our collateral or the value of our derivative instruments suddenly decrease, or margin requirements increase, we may be required to post additional collateral for certain of these arrangements, causing an adverse change in our liquidity position. Furthermore, there is no assurance that we will always be able to renew (or roll) our short-term funding liabilities at their scheduled maturities, which could materially harm our liquidity position and result in substantial losses. In addition, in some cases our counterparties have the option to increase our haircuts (margin requirements) on the assets we pledge against our funding liabilities, thereby reducing the amount that can be borrowed against an asset even if they agree to renew or roll our funding liabilities. Significantly higher haircuts would require us to post additional collateral and could reduce our ability to leverage our portfolio or may even force us to sell assets, especially if correlated with asset price declines or faster prepayment rates on our assets. 
 Additionally, as a REIT, we are required to distribute a significant portion of our taxable income annually, which constrains our ability to accumulate operating cash flow and therefore may require us to utilize debt or equity capital to finance our business and, therefore, we are exposed to risks related to the equity capital markets, and our related ability to raise capital through the issuance of our common stock, preferred stock or other equity instruments. We seek to mitigate these risks by monitoring the equity capital markets to inform our decisions on the amount, timing, and terms of capital we raise. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 Neither we, nor our subsidiaries, nor Ellington nor its affiliates (including our Manager) are currently subject to any legal proceedings that we or our Manager consider material to us. Nevertheless, we, our subsidiaries, and Ellington and its affiliates operate in highly regulated markets that currently are under regulatory scrutiny, and over the years, Ellington and its affiliates have received, and we expect in the future that we and they may receive, inquiries and requests for documents and information from various federal, state and foreign regulators. 
 We and Ellington cannot provide any assurance that, whether the result of regulatory inquiries or otherwise, neither we nor Ellington nor its affiliates will become subject to investigations, enforcement actions, fines, penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims or that, if any such events were to occur, they would not materially adversely affect us. For a discussion of these and other related risks, see "Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors We, Ellington, or its affiliates may be subject to regulatory inquiries and proceedings, or other legal proceedings" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors
