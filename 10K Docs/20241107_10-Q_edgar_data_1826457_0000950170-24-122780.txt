 million. The Company has incurred losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception, including net losses of million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company expects that its operating losses and negative cash flows will continue for the foreseeable future as the Company continues to develop its product candidates. The Company currently expects that its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of million as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to fund operating expenses and capital requirements for at least 12 months from the date the third quarter interim condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. However, additional funding will be necessary to fund future discovery research, pre-clinical and clinical activities. The Company will seek additional funding through public financings, debt financings, collaboration agreements, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. Although it has been successful in raising capital in the past, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining such additional financing on terms acceptable to it, if at all, and the Company may not be able to enter into collaborations or other arrangements. If the Company is unable to obtain funding, it could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate its research and development programs, product portfolio expansion or commercialization efforts, which could adversely affect the Company s business prospects, even the ability to continue operations.

Money market funds are highly liquid investments and are actively traded. The pricing information on the Company s money market funds are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical securities. This approach results in the classification of these securities as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of pension plan assets has been determined as the surrender value of the portfolio of active insured members held within the Columna Collective Foundation Group investment fund and are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Marketable securities consist of corporate debt securities and U.S. Treasury securities which are classified as available-for-sale pursuant to ASC 320, Investments Debt and Equity Securities . Marketable securities are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets. The fair values of these investments are estimated by taking into consideration valuations obtained from third-party pricing services. The pricing services utilize industry standard valuation models, including both income- and market-based approaches, for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly, to estimate fair value. These inputs include reported trades of and broker/dealer quotes on the same or similar securities, issuer credit spreads, benchmark securities based on historical data and other observable inputs.

finance leases as of September 30, 2024. ROU assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the Company s leases do not provide an implicit rate, management estimated the incremental borrowing rate based on the rate of interest the Company would have to pay to borrow a similar amount on a collateralized basis over a similar term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Klybeckstrasse Lease In March 2021, the Company entered into an operating lease agreement for office and lab space with Wincasa AG, or the landlord, that occupies approximately square feet located at Klybeckstrasse 191, 4057 Basel, Basel-City, Switzerland. In April 2023, the Company and the Landlord amended the Klybeckstrasse Lease which increased the office and lab space square footage from square feet to square feet and extended the term of the lease through June 30, 2027. The amendment was accounted for as a lease modification and resulted in an increases to the related ROU asset and operating lease liability of million. Harrison Avenue Lease In December 2021, the Company entered into a non-cancelable lease agreement for square feet of office and laboratory space to support its expanding operations, or the Harrison Avenue Lease. The term of the lease commenced on and the Company s obligation to pay rent began on December 21, 2022. The initial term of the lease is following the commencement date at which point the Company has the option to extend the lease an additional . As of the lease commencement date, the Company has determined that it is not reasonably certain to exercise the option to extend the lease and has not included the extension period in the lease term. The annual base rent under the Harrison Avenue Lease is per square foot for the first year, which is subject to scheduled annual increases of , plus certain costs, operating expenses and property management fees. Pursuant to the terms of the Harrison Avenue Lease, the landlord reimbursed the Company for million of tenant improvements. The Company reduced the related ROU asset by the amounts reimbursed by the landlord and capitalized the leasehold improvements as fixed assets on the consolidated balance sheet.

million non-refundable upfront payment for the initial set of targets. Pursuant to the terms of the Roche Agreement, the Company expects to be entitled to receive from Roche certain variable consideration including potential pre-clinical milestones up to million, and potential clinical, commercial and sales milestones exceeding billion. For the additional option targets, upon Roche s exercise of their option, the Company is entitled to receive an upfront payment of up to million and potential pre-clinical, clinical, commercial and sales milestones exceeding billion. The Company is also eligible to receive tiered royalties ranging from high-single-digits to low-teens on any products that are commercialized by Roche as a result of the collaboration. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has received 9.0 million related to Roche's decision to exercise its option rights for continued research and development services. The related payments are initially classified as deferred revenue in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet and recognized in revenue as the related research and development services are performed. Accounting This agreement represents a transaction with a customer and therefore is accounted for under ASC 606 Revenue From Contracts With Customers . The Company determined that the development and commercialization licenses for each of the collaboration targets is neither capable of being distinct nor distinct within the context from the promised initial research services. In addition, the Company has determined that each target in the agreement is distinct from other targets because: (i) Roche can benefit from the license and research services for a given target on their own since the results related thereto can be evaluated discretely and (ii) the results of the research and development of each target does not affect either the Company s ability to perform or Roche s ability to assess the results for any other target. As such, the Company has identified certain performance obligations within the agreement as follows: Performance obligations for the research and development of initial targets 

 Performance obligations for the research and development services related to Roche s option to replace certain targets 

 The total transaction price of the Roche Agreement is allocated to the performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling price. The Company developed the standalone selling price for the performance obligations included in the Roche Agreement by determining the total estimated costs to fulfill each performance obligation identified with the objective of determining the price at which it would sell such an item if it were to be sold regularly on a standalone basis. The allocated transaction price is recognized as revenue from collaboration agreements in one of two ways: Research and development of the initial targets: The Company recognizes the portion of the transaction price allocated to each of the research and development performance obligations as the research and development services are provided, using an input method, in proportion to costs incurred to date for each research development target as compared to total costs incurred and expected to be incurred in the future to satisfy the underlying obligation related to said research and development target. The transfer of control occurs over this period and, in management s judgment, is the best measure of progress towards satisfying the performance obligation. 

 Option rights: The transaction price allocated to the options rights, which are considered material rights, is deferred until the period that Roche elects to exercise or elects to not exercise its option right to license and commercialize the underlying research and development target. Upon Roche's exercise of an option right, the Company will recognize the portion of the transaction price allocated using the input method described above. Any payments made to exercise option rights will be added to the allocated value and recognized as the related services are performed. 

 As of September 30, 2024, million has been recognized as collaboration revenue in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss and the remaining million of the upfront payment and subsequent milestone payments related to customer options are recorded as deferred revenue in the liabilities section of the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

 Ite m 2. Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. This discussion and analysis and other parts of this Quarterly Report contain forward-looking statements based upon current beliefs, plans and expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such as statements regarding our plans, objectives, expectations, intentions and projections. Our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors, including those set forth in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report and under Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. You should carefully read the Risk Factors section of this Quarterly Report to gain an understanding of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Please also see the section entitled Special note regarding forward-looking statements. 
 Overview 
 We are a biotechnology company developing a portfolio of novel and proprietary MGDs. MGDs are small molecule drugs that employ the body s natural protein destruction mechanisms to selectively degrade therapeutically-relevant proteins. MGDs work by inducing the engagement of defined surfaces identified on target proteins by an E3 ligase, such as cereblon. We have developed a proprietary and industry-leading protein degradation platform, called QuEEN TM to enable our unique, target-centric, MGD discovery and development and our rational design of MGD products. We believe our small molecule MGDs may give us significant advantages over existing therapeutic modalities, including other protein degradation approaches. We prioritize our product development on therapeutic targets backed by strong biological and genetic rationale with the goal of discovering and developing novel medicines. 
 Monte Rosa Therapeutics AG, a Swiss operating company, was incorporated under the laws of Switzerland in April 2018. Monte Rosa Therapeutics, Inc was incorporated in Delaware in November 2019. We are headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts with research operations in both Boston and Basel, Switzerland.

Our most advanced product candidate, MRT-2359, is an orally bioavailable MGD targeting the translation termination factor protein GSPT1. The FDA cleared the IND for MRT-2359 in September 2022, and we initiated a phase 1/2 clinical trial for the treatment of MYC-driven solid and high-grade neuroendocrine tumors in October 2022. In October 2023, we presented interim data from the Phase 1 dose escalation part of our Phase 1/2 clinical trial of MRT-2359 demonstrating favorable pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and tolerability profiles and early, but we believe promising, signs of clinical activity, including tumor size reductions in patients with biomarker-positive cancers. In January 2023, MRT-2359 received Fast Track designation from the FDA for the treatment of patients with previously treated, metastatic NSCLC with L-MYC or N-MYC expression. In June 2023, MRT-2359 received Orphan Drug Designation from FDA for treatment of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). In December 2023, MRT-2359 received Fast Track Designation from the FDA for the treatment of patients with previously treated, metastatic SCLC with L-MYC or N-MYC expression. In June 2024, we announced initial safety and pharmacodynamic data from the 0.5 mg dose using the 21 days on, 7 days off regimen. We continue to evaluate a higher 0.75 mg, 21 days on, 7 days off dose cohort. We look forward to announcing updated clinical data before the end of 2024. 
 In October 2024, we announced a global exclusive development and commercialization license agreement with Novartis to advance VAV1 MGDs, including MRT-6160, currently in Phase 1 clinical development, for various immune-related conditions. In August 2024, we announced that the first participants had been dosed in an MRT-6160 Phase 1 single ascending dose/multiple ascending dose, or SAD/MAD, study. Initial clinical results, including safety, pharmacokinetics, VAV1 protein degradation, and key downstream pharmacodynamic markers, are anticipated by the first quarter of 2025. 
 In addition, MRT-8102, a NEK7-directed MGD for inflammatory diseases driven by IL-1 and the NLRP3 inflammasome, is now in IND-enabling studies, with an IND filing with the FDA planned for the first half of 2025. 
 Further, our CDK2 and Cyclin E1-directed MGD programs are progressing and continue to advance towards development candidate nominations. We expect to nominate a development candidate for the CDK2-directed MGD program by year-end 2024. 
 Liquidity 
 To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the issuance and sale of convertible promissory notes, convertible preferred stock, public offerings of our common stock, registered direct offerings, and through our collaboration with Roche. From our inception through the date hereof, there have been aggregate inflows of 684.8 million of gross proceeds from such transactions. Since inception, we have had significant operating losses. Our primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses, which consist primarily of research and development expenditures and, to a lesser extent, general and administrative expenditures. Our net loss was 135.4 million and 108.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and our net loss was 86.1 million and 102.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 452.0 million and 247.1 million in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. 
 Impact of global economic and political developments 
 The development of our product candidates could be disrupted and materially adversely affected in the future by global economic or political developments. In addition, economic uncertainty in global markets caused by political instability and conflict, and economic challenges caused by global pandemics or other public health events, may lead to market disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices, credit and capital market instability and supply chain interruptions. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by negative impacts on the global economy and capital markets resulting from these global economic conditions, particularly if such conditions are prolonged or worsen. 
 Components of operating results 
 Collaboration Revenue 
 Collaboration revenue represents amounts earned from our Collaboration and License Agreement with Roche. 
 Research and development expenses 
 Our research and development expenses include: 
 expenses incurred under agreements with consultants, third-party service providers that conduct research and development activities on our behalf; 

personnel costs, which include salaries, benefits, pension and stock-based compensation; 

17 

laboratory and vendor expenses related to the execution of preclinical and clinical studies; 

laboratory supplies and materials used for internal research and development activities; and 

facilities and equipment costs. 

Most of our research and development expenses have been related to the development of our QuEEN TM platform and advancement of our GSPT1 program, advancement of our disclosed and undisclosed programs including for CDK2, NEK7, VAV1, and CCNE1. With the exception of costs incurred for research and development on behalf of third parties, we have not reported program costs since our inception because we have not historically tracked or recorded our research and development expenses on a program-by-program basis. We use our personnel and infrastructure resources across the breadth of our research and development activities, which are directed toward identifying and developing product candidates. 
 We expense all research and development costs in the periods in which they are incurred. Costs for certain research and development activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information and data provided to us by our vendors and third-party service providers. 
 We expect our research and development expenses to increase substantially for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in research and development activities related to developing our product candidates, including investments in manufacturing, as we advance our programs and conduct clinical trials. The process of conducting the necessary clinical research to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming, and the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. As a result, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects, the costs of related clinical development costs or when and to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates. 
 General and administrative expenses 
 Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and other expenses for outside professional services, including legal fees relating to patent and corporate matters, professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and administrative consulting services, insurance costs and other operating costs. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase over the next several years to support our continued research and development activities, manufacturing activities, and the potential commercialization of our product candidates and development of commercial infrastructure. We also anticipate our general and administrative costs will increase and with respect to the hiring of additional personnel, fees to outside consultants, lawyers and accountants, and costs associated with being a public company, such as expenses related to services associated with maintaining compliance with Nasdaq listing rules and SEC reporting requirements, insurance and investor relations costs. 
 Non-operating income and (expense) 
 Our non-operating income and (expense) includes (i) interest earned on our investments, including principally U.S. government-backed money-market funds and marketable securities; (ii) gains and losses on transactions of our Swiss subsidiary denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar; (iii) proceeds from the sale of fixed assets; and (iv) realized losses on the sale of marketable securities.

 Liquidity and capital resources 
 Overview 	 
 Due to our significant research and development expenditures, we have generated operating losses since our inception. We have funded our operations primarily through the sale of convertible promissory notes, convertible preferred stock, public offerings of our common stock and through our collaboration with Roche. As of September 30, 2024, we had 247.1 million in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. We have incurred losses since our inception and, as of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 452.0 million. Our primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses, which consist primarily of research and development expenditures, and to a lesser extent, general and administrative expenditures. Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay these expenses, as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable and accrued expenses. 
 At-the-Market Offering 
 On July 1, 2022, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-266003) with the SEC, which was declared effective on July 13, 2022, or the Shelf Registration Statement, in relation to the registration of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and/or units of any combination thereof for the purposes of selling, from time to time, our common stock, debt securities or other equity securities in one or more offerings. We also simultaneously entered into a Sales Agreement, or the Sales Agreement, with Jefferies LLC, or Jefferies, to provide for the offering, issuance and sale of up to an aggregate amount of 100.0 million of our common stock from time to time in at-the-market offerings, or the ATM Program, under the Shelf Registration Statement and subject to the limitations thereof. We will pay to the Jefferies cash commissions of up to 3.0 percent of the aggregate gross proceeds of sales of common stock under the Sales Agreement. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, 2,612,514 shares have been sold pursuant to the ATM Program. 
 Underwritten Public Offering 
 In May 2024, we entered into an underwriting agreement with TD Securities (USA) LLC, as representative of the several underwriters, related to an underwritten public offering, or the Offering, of 10,638,476 shares of common stock at a price of 4.70 per share, and, in lieu of Common Stock to certain investors, pre-funded warrants to purchase 10,638,524 shares of Common Stock at a price of 4.6999 per pre-funded warrant The purchase price per share of each pre-funded warrant represents the per share public offering price for the common stock, minus the 0.0001 per share exercise price of such pre-funded warrant.. The pre-funded warrants are immediately exercisable and may be exercised at any time until the pre-funded warrants are exercised in full. Aggregate gross proceeds from the Offering were 100 million, or aggregate net proceeds of 96.4 million after deducting the underwriter discounts, commissions, and other offering costs. 
 Registered Direct Offering 
 In October 2023, we sold in a registered direct offering pursuant to a securities purchase agreement pre-funded warrants to purchase 10,000,400 shares of the our common stock to an accredited investor at a purchase price of 2.4999 per pre-funded warrant for aggregate gross proceeds of 25.0 million. The pre-funded warrants are immediately exercisable at an exercise price of 0.0001 per share.

Operating activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities of 86.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was attributable to our net loss of 86.1 million and decreases in our working capital of 18.3 million, partially off-set by non-cash charges of 17.5 million principally with respect to depreciation expense and stock-based compensation. 
 Net cash used in operating activities of 73.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was attributable to our net loss of 102.1 million off-set by an increase in our working capital of 14.8 million and non-cash charges of 13.9 million principally with respect to depreciation expense and stock-based compensation. 
 Investing activities 
 Cash used in investing activities of 13.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to proceeds from the maturity of marketable securities of 152.6 million, offset by purchases of marketable securities of 162.4 million and purchases of property and equipment of 3.8 million. 
 Cash provided by investing activities of 74.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to proceeds from the maturity of marketable securities of 121.8 million and proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of 45.6 million, offset by purchases of marketable securities of 75.6 million and purchases of property and equipment of 17.4 million. 
 Financing activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities of 98.3 million for nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due the net proceeds from our Offering of 96.4 million. 
 Funding requirements 
 Any product candidates we may develop may never achieve commercialization and we anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We expect that our research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses and capital expenditures will continue to increase. As a result, until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings or other capital sources, including potential collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements. Our primary uses of capital are, and we expect will continue to be, compensation and related expenses, third-party clinical research, manufacturing and development services, costs relating to the build-out of our headquarters, laboratories and manufacturing facility, license payments or milestone obligations that may arise, laboratory and related supplies, clinical costs, manufacturing costs, legal and other regulatory expenses and general overhead costs. 
 Based upon our current operating plan, and the anticipated 150 million upfront payment due from Novartis, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. We base this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. 
 We will continue to require additional financing to advance our current product candidates through clinical development, to develop, acquire or in-license other potential product candidates and to fund operations for the foreseeable future. We will continue to seek funds through equity offerings, debt financings or other capital sources, including potential collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. If we do raise additional capital through public or private equity offerings, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our stockholders rights. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, we may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Any failure to raise capital as and when needed could 
 22 

have a negative impact on our financial condition and on our ability to pursue our business plans and strategies. If we are unable to raise capital, we will need to delay, reduce or terminate planned activities to reduce costs. 
 Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our operating capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to: 
 the scope, progress, results and costs of researching, developing and manufacturing our current product candidates or any future product candidates, and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials; 

the timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals or clearances for our lead product candidates or any future product candidates; 

the number and characteristics of any additional product candidates we develop or acquire; 

the cost of manufacturing our lead product candidate or any future product candidates and any products we successfully commercialize, including costs associated with building-out our manufacturing capabilities; 

our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations, licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of any such agreements that we may enter into; 

the expenses needed to attract and retain skilled personnel; 

the costs associated with being a public company; 

the timing, receipt and amount of sales of any future approved or cleared products, if any; and 

the impact of global economic and political developments, future public health events and the corresponding responses of businesses and governments. 

Further, our operating plans may change, and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements for clinical trials and other research and development activities. We currently have no credit facility or committed sources of capital. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated product development programs. 
 Critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates 
 Our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. The preparation of our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, costs and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our condensed financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. However, even though we believe we have used reasonable estimates and assumptions in preparing our interim condensed consolidated financial statements, the future effects of global economic and political developments and any future public health events on our results of operations, cash flows, and financial position are unclear. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 To date, our revenues have primarily consisted of consideration related to the License and Collaboration Agreement with Roche, which we are accounting for under ASC 606. In accordance with ASC 606, we recognize revenue when our customers obtain control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. 
 To determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized for arrangements determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we perform the following five steps: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the assessment of the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when, or as we satisfy each performance obligation. 
 As part of the accounting for arrangements under ASC 606, we must use significant judgment to determine the performance obligations based on the determination under step (ii) above. We also use judgment to determine whether 
 23 

milestones or other variable consideration, except for royalties and sales-based milestones, should be included in the transaction price as described below. We recognize revenue based on those amounts when, or as, the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied. 
 The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring goods and services to the customer. To the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration, we estimate the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price utilizing either the expected value method or the most likely amount method, depending on the nature of the variable consideration. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in management s judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. Any estimates, including the effect of the constraint on variable consideration, are evaluated at each reporting period for any changes. 
 If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis unless the transaction price is variable and meets the criteria to be allocated entirely to a performance obligation or to a distinct service that forms part of a single performance obligation. The consideration to be received is allocated among the separate performance obligations based on relative standalone selling prices. Determining the standalone selling price of each performance obligation requires significant judgment and is discussed in further detail in Note 9. 
 We utilize judgment to assess the nature of the performance obligation to determine whether the performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjust the measure of performance and related revenue recognition. The measure of progress, and the resulting periods over which revenue should be recognized, are subject to estimates by management and may change over the course of the arrangement, which are subject to review by the joint research committee, or JRC. Such a change could have a material impact on the amount of revenue we record in future periods. We concluded that the transfer of control to the customer for the performance obligation occurs over the time period that the research and development services are provided by us. We recognize revenue for the performance obligation as those services are provided using an input method, based on the cumulative costs incurred compared to the total estimated costs expected to be incurred to satisfy the performance obligation. The percentage of completion method is, in management s judgment, the best measure of progress towards satisfying the performance condition. 
 At the inception of each arrangement that includes research, development or regulatory milestone payments, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered likely to be met and estimate the amount to be considered for inclusion in the transaction price using the most-likely-amount method. If it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. For milestone payments due upon events that are not within our control, such as regulatory approvals, we are not able to assert that it is likely that the regulatory approval will be granted and that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur until those approvals are received. In making this assessment, we evaluate factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial, and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the particular milestone. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized would not occur. 
 We reevaluate the transaction price and our total estimated costs expected to be incurred at the end of each reporting period and as uncertain events, such as changes to the expected timing and cost of certain research, development and manufacturing activities that we are responsible for, are resolved or other changes in circumstances occur. If necessary, we will adjust our estimate of the transaction price or our estimates of the total costs expected to be incurred. To date, we have not had any significant changes in our estimates. 
 Other than the Company's revenue recognition policy described above, there have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies from those described in Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 For a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and Note 2 to our 2023 Annual Report.

Contractual obligations and commitments 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations and commitments from those described under Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 14, 2024. 
 Off-balance sheet arrangements 
 During the periods presented, we did not have, nor do we currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined under SEC rules. 
 Emerging growth company status 
 
In April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company may take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Therefore, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we may adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-public companies instead of the dates required for other public companies. However, we may early adopt these standards. 
 We will cease to be an emerging growth company on the date that is the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of 1.235 billion or more, (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the closing of our initial public offering, or our IPO, (iii) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large, accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC. 
 We are also a smaller reporting company, meaning that the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates plus the aggregate amount of gross proceeds to us as a result of our IPO is less than 700 million and our annual revenue was less than 100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company after our IPO if either (i) the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 250 million or (ii) our annual revenue was less than 100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700 million. If we are a smaller reporting company at the time we cease to be an emerging growth company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies. Specifically, as a smaller reporting company we may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our annual reports on Form 10-K and, similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation. 
 25 

Ite m 3. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this Item 3. 
 Ite m 4. Controls and procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of such date are effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during three months ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management recognizes that any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain judgments and assumptions and cannot provide absolute assurance that its objectives will be met. Similarly, an evaluation of controls cannot provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. 
 
 26 

Pa rt II Other Information 
 Ite m 1. Legal proceedings 
 From time to time, we may become subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, as of September 30, 2024, we do not believe we are party to any claim or litigation the outcome of which, if determined adversely to us, would individually or in the aggregate be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. 
 Ite m 1A. Risk factors 
 Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties, those risks and uncertainties discussed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report, as amended and supplemented by the information in our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, together with all of the other information contained in this Quarterly Report, including our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. The risk factor disclosure in our 2023 Annual Report and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q is qualified by the information that is described in this Quarterly Report. If any of the risks described below or in our 2023 Annual Report actually occur, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition could suffer materially. In such event, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you might lose all or part of your investment. 
 Other than as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors set forth in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 Risks related to our financial position and capital needs 
 We have incurred significant operating losses since our inception and anticipate that we will incur continued losses for the foreseeable future. 
 Since our inception, we have focused substantially all of our efforts and financial resources on developing our proprietary QuEEN TM platform, our proprietary MGD library and our initial pipeline of product candidates. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the issuance and sale of convertible promissory notes, convertible preferred stock, public offerings of our common stock, registered direct offerings, and through our collaboration with Roche. From our inception through the date hereof, we raised an aggregate of 684.8 million of gross proceeds from such transactions. As of September 30, 2024, our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities were 247.1 million. We have incurred net losses in each year since our inception, and we had an accumulated deficit of 452.0 million as of September 30, 2024. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we reported net losses of 135.4 million and 108.5 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we reported a net loss of 86.1 million and 102.1 million, respectively. Substantially all of our operating losses have resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and initial pipeline programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses over the next several years and for the foreseeable future. Our prior losses, combined with expected future losses, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders deficit and working capital. We expect our expenses to significantly increase in connection with our ongoing activities, as we: 
 conduct our clinical trial for MRT-2359, our MGD product candidate targeting GSPT1, and MRT-6160, our MGD product candidate targeting VAV1; 

continue preclinical activities for our VAV1, NEK7, CDK2, CCNE1, and other currently undisclosed programs; 

prepare and submit IND applications with the FDA for other current and future product candidates, including for MRT-8102, our MGD product candidate targeting NEK7; complete preclinical studies for current or future product candidates; 

progress MGD molecules from our initial programs through lead optimization to development candidates; 

initiate and complete clinical trials for current or future product candidates; 

expand and improve the capabilities of our QuEEN TM platform; 

continue to build our proprietary library of MGDs; 

27 

contract to manufacture our product candidates; 

advance research and development related activities to expand our product pipeline; 

seek regulatory approval for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical development; 

develop and scale up our capabilities to support our ongoing preclinical activities and future clinical trials for our product candidates and commercialization of any of our product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval; maintain, expand, and protect our intellectual property portfolio; 

hire additional staff, including clinical, scientific and management personnel; and 

secure facilities to support continued growth in our research, development and commercialization efforts. 

In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for our current or future product candidates, we will incur significant expenses relating to our commercialization of such product candidates via our sales, marketing, product manufacturing and distribution efforts. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical drugs, including in light of economic fluctuations, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we will become profitable, if at all. 
 Even if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase our profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would depress the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our development efforts, obtain product approvals, diversify our offerings or continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment.
