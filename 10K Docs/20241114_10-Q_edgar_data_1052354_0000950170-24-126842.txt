The notional amount represents the maximum potential pay out that the Trading Company could be required to make if a credit event were to occur under each agreement. The maximum payout amount may be offset by the subsequent sale, if any, of assets obtained via the execution of a payout event, upfront fees received upon entering into the contracts, or net amounts received from the settlement of offsetting purchased protection in credit default swap contracts entered into by the Trading Company for the same reference entity or entities. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all credit default swap contracts entered into by the Trading Company are on indices. The credit spread is generally indicative of the status of the underlying risk of default by the applicable reference entity or index and is likely to be different than the contractual spread on the credit default swap. Higher credit spreads are indicative of a higher likelihood of non-performance by the underlying reference entity.

Forward contracts 

Swap agreements 

The trading activity of open future, forward and swap contracts as of September 30, 2024, September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2023 is indicative of the trading activity throughout the three and nine month periods. The Trading Company trades derivative financial instruments that involve varying degrees of market and credit risk. Market risks may arise from unfavorable changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or the fair values of the instruments underlying the contracts. All contracts are stated at fair value, and changes in those values are reflected in the net change in unrealized trading appreciation/(depreciation) on open contracts/agreements in the Statements of Operations. Credit risk arises from the potential inability of counterparties to perform in accordance with the terms of a contract. The credit risk for OTC derivative contracts is limited to the net unrealized gain plus any collateral posted net of unrealized losses or upfront fees posted, if any, for each counterparty for which a netting agreement exists and is included in the Statements of Financial Condition. Upfront fees are listed in the Statements of Financial Condition as net premiums paid/received on credit default swap agreements and are shown net by counterparty for which a netting agreement exists. Counterparty relationships are governed by various contracts. These contracts can be based on industry standard agreements, such as International Swap and Derivatives Association agreements for OTC contracts. These agreements set forth each party s basic rights, responsibilities, and duties. These agreements also contain information regarding financial terms and conditions, as well as termination and events of default provisions. Certain agreements contain provisions that require the Trading Company to post additional collateral upon the occurrence of specific credit risk related events or upon notice from the counterparty. As the Trading Company s trading strategies are dependent upon the existence of these agreements, the Trading Company s counterparties usually have multiple specified events under which they can terminate individual transactions or the entire agreement.

Amounts in the table above exclude foreign exchange spot contracts. As described above, the Trading Company may enter into netting agreements with its derivative contract counterparties whereby the Trading Company may, under certain circumstances, offset with the counterparty certain derivative financial instruments payables and/or receivables with collateral held and/or posted and create one single net payment. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Trading Company was subject to netting agreements that allowed for amounts owed between the Trading Company and its counterparty to be netted. The party that has the larger payable pays the excess of the larger amount over the smaller amount to the other party. The netting agreements do not apply to amounts owed to or from different counterparties.

ITEM 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Introduction Reference is made to Item 1, Financial Statements. The information contained therein is essential to, and should be read in conjunction with, the following analysis. Operational Overview Man-AHL Diversified I L.P. (the Partnership is a fund which engages in speculative trading of futures and forward contracts and related instruments through its investment in Man-AHL Diversified Trading Company L.P. (the Trading Company pursuant to the AHL Diversified Program, directed on behalf of the Trading Company by AHL Partners LLP (the Trading Advisor ). The Trading Advisor also serves as the Partnership s commodity pool operator. The AHL Diversified Program is a price trend-following trading system, entirely quantitative in nature, and implements trading positions on the basis of statistical analyses of past price histories. The objective of the AHL Diversified Program is to deliver capital growth for commensurate levels of volatility over the medium term, independent of the movement of the stock and bond markets, through the speculative trading, directly and indirectly, of futures, options and forward contracts, swaps and other financial derivatives both on and off exchange. The AHL Diversified Program trades globally in several market sectors, including, without limitation, currencies, bonds, energies, stock indices, interest rates, credit, metals, agricultural and volatility. In the future, the AHL Diversified Program may, to a limited extent, invest in stocks. The AHL Diversified Program is proprietary and confidential, so that substantially the only information that can be furnished regarding the Partnership s results of operations is contained in the performance record of its trading through the Trading Company. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of its future results. Man Investments (USA) Corp., the general partner of the Partnership (the General Partner does believe, however, that there are certain market conditions, for example, markets with pronounced price trends, in which the Partnership has a greater likelihood of being profitable than in other market environments. Capital Resources and Liquidity Units of limited partnership interests Units of the Partnership may be offered for sale as of the beginning, and may be redeemed as of the end, of each month. The Partnership raises additional capital only through the sale of Units and capital is increased through trading profits (if any) and interest income. The Partnership does not engage in borrowing. The Partnership, not being an operating company, does not incur capital expenditures. It functions solely as a passive trading vehicle, investing the substantial majority of its assets in the Trading Company. Its remaining capital resources are used only as assets available to make further investments in the Trading Company and to pay Partnership level expenses. Accordingly, the amount of capital raised for the Partnership should not have a significant impact on its operations. Partnership assets not invested in the Trading Company are maintained in cash and cash equivalents in bank accounts or accounts with The Bank of New York Mellon and are readily available to the Partnership. The Partnership may redeem any part or all of its limited partnership interest in the Trading Company at any month-end at the net asset value per unit of the Trading Company. The Trading Company s assets are generally held as cash or cash equivalents which are used to margin futures and provide collateral for forward contracts and other over-the-counter OTC contract positions and are withdrawn, as necessary, to pay redemptions (to the Partnership and other investors in the Trading Company). Other than potential market-imposed limitations on liquidity, due, for example, to limited open interest in certain futures markets or to daily price fluctuation limits, which are inherent in the Trading Company s futures trading, the Trading Company s assets are highly liquid and are expected to remain so. There have been no material changes with respect to the Partnership s critical accounting policies, off-balance sheet arrangements or disclosure of contractual obligations as reported in the Partnership s Form 10-K filed March 22, 2024.

Results of Operations Due to the nature of the Partnership s trading, the results of operations for the interim period presented should not be considered indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire year. Periods Ended September 30, 2024 : 

30-September-24 

Ending Equity 

79,935,059 

Nine months ended September 30, 2024: Net assets decreased 6,788,978 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This decrease was attributable to subscriptions in the amount of 415,000, redemptions in the amount of 10,034,525 and a net gain from operations of 2,830,547. Management Fees of 1,969,812 and servicing fees of 658,683 were paid or accrued, and interest of 3,319,723 was earned or accrued on the Partnership s share of the Trading Company s cash and cash equivalent investments and broker balances, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Partnership s other expenses paid or accrued for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 1,067,165. Three months ended September 30, 2024: Net assets decreased 10,772,049 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. This decrease was attributable to subscriptions in the amount of 0, redemptions in the amount of 1,866,034 and a net loss from operations of 8,906,015. Management Fees of 606,368 and servicing fees of 202,724 were paid or accrued, and interest of 1,077,401 was earned or accrued on the Partnership s share of the Trading Company s cash and cash equivalent investments and broker balances, for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The Partnership s other expenses paid or accrued for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 325,855. In July, the Partnership returned negative net of fees, driven by losses in currencies and fixed income. A net long US dollar overall position was not profitable, while the Partnership s short yen position against the US dollar was also unprofitable, however, the Partnership s position in Sterling against a basket of currencies led to some offsetting gains. The Partnership s fixed income losses were concentrated at the short end of the curve as increased rate cut expectations hurt positions in Euribor and SOFR. Further out the maturity spectrum, European bond positions generated the biggest losses, flipping from short to long in the process. Within commodities, trading in agricultural generated gains, most notably from short soybeans position, while energies trading was broadly flat, with gains from short US natural gas being offset by losses from long oil positions. Within metals, longs in both silver and copper 

 31 

detracted. Long positions in risk assets scraped a positive return. In Japan, indices fell and long positions in Taiwanese indices suffered in sympathy with falls in the Magnificent 7. Gains from longs in Canadian and Australian indices offset these losses. Credit trading pipped equities for top performance on the month, led by long positions in high-yielding names in the US and Europe. The Partnership ended August down on the month, driven by losses in stocks and currencies. Risk assets bore the brunt of August s early reversal, with tempered exposures unable to fully recover losses amid the subsequent market rally. Long Asian indices were particularly affected, with Japanese stocks seeing their largest daily loss since 1987. Elsewhere, long US small caps and European indices compounded declines. As credit spreads widened, the Partnership s long high yield exposure lead to declines. Forex trading dragged on performance amid a softening US dollar, particularly against Asian currencies, where short exposure to the Korean won and Chinese renminbi drove declines. The US dollar weakening hurt the Partnership s net long US dollar positioning, however long Sterling helped offset as the pound hit a two-year high against the US dollar. Fixed income losses were concentrated at the short end of the curve with the Partnership only just switching to net long amid the early August rout, which suffered later in the month. Performance was mixed further out the maturity spectrum, with long Japanese bonds generating notable declines. In commodities, losses stemmed from metals and energies trading, notably short aluminum. Similarly, oil uprooted market price expectations with long positions falling on curbed Chinese demand and rising inventory levels. Agricultural trading partially offset losses as coffee surged. In September, the Partnership returned positive net of fees, with positive attributions from fixed income, FX, equity, and metals trading, offset by losses from agricultural and energies. The Partnership s transition to long fixed income over the quarter was rewarded as yields declined across most regions and tenors. Top performers were Italian bonds. A loss was incurred in Gilts, while a decreasing US dollar lead to gains in currency pairs such as the South African rand and British pound. Losses were incurred from a long position in the Chilean peso against the US dollar, however, as the Chilean central bank cut rates but gave dovish forward guidance. Top performers within equities were longs in the MSCI EM index and Hang Seng, while a loss was made from a short in the FTSE China A50 index. Long credit positions were all beneficial, most notably in high yielding CDS indices on both sides of the Atlantic. Trading in commodities was mixed. A declining US dollar and falling rates were positive for longs in precious metals. A short US natural gas position was hurt as prices rose. Within agricultural, returns were quite disparate; a long in coffee was beneficial, while losses were seen in the soy complex. Three months ended June 30, 2024: In April, the Partnership generated a positive return, with gains from fixed income, FX and commodities offsetting losses from equities. The Partnership s short fixed income positions were largely profitable, though losses were experienced trading Japanese bond futures. The Partnership s net long US dollar positions performed well against a variety of currencies, specifically, the Japanese Yen, while a short position in the US dollar against the Mexican Peso generated a loss. Within commodities, metals did the best, with long positions in copper and gold generating positive returns. Returns from trading agricultural were more muted, with losses from a short wheat position offset by gains from long coffee. Energies trading generated losses from short US natural gas, long gas oil and short carbon emissions. The Partnership s long equity positions generally experienced losses this month, though there were certain exceptions, including a long position in the FTSE100 index. Long credit positions also generated losses, with the US and EU higher-yielding names faring worst. In May, the Partnership generated a negative return net of fees, with losses in FX, commodities and bonds outweighing gains from equities and credit. In FX trading, the Partnership s broad net long US dollar positioning, most notably against the Swiss franc and Norwegian krone incurred losses. Japan s yen rose, generating losses, but were mostly recovered as it fell back again as the month progressed. Commodities trading also generated losses, though there was variation across sub-sectors. Energies did the worst, with the Partnership s short in US natural gas being one of the worst performers. Within agricultural, short positions across the soy complex generated losses. Metals trading, however, provided gains through long silver and copper positions. The increase in bonds in the beginning of the month hurt the Partnership s short positions in treasuries across the maturity spectrum, though despite an early loss in the Partnership s short position in Japanese bonds, the position ended the month as the sector s top performer. In equities, the Partnership s net long equity positions, specifically in Taiwanese equities, were profitable for the month. Broadly positive market sentiment boosted long credit positions, most notably in the US. In June, Partnership posted negative returns net of fees with losses dominated by fixed income and energies, while marginal gains came from equities and agricultural. The decline in yields affected the Partnership s short positioning in rates markets, with losses experienced notably in Euribor and SOFR contracts. In contrast, the Partnership experienced small gains in OAT yields. Within commodities, trading in metals struggled with losses seen in copper. Energy trading dipped into the red, driven by losses from a short heating oil position. Agricultural trading, on the other hand, generated gains via short positions in corn and in the soy complex. Trading in currencies finished flat, but there was considerable intra-sector variability. The Japanese yen continued to fall against multiple currencies, which suited positioning, though gains were offset from losses in the Partnership s long position in the Mexican peso against the US dollar. Equities trading was beneficial in June as the Partnership s two index positions in Taiwan topped the performance table for both the month and the year, while a loss was experienced from a long in the CAC 40 index. Credit trading was 

 32 

bifurcated; the Partnership experienced losses from its European index positioning while trading in the US indices finished the month around flat. Three months ended March 31, 2024: The Partnership ended January in the red net of fees, with gains from equity trading offset by losses in credit, commodities, FX and fixed income. Long positions in the Nikkei and Tokyo Stock Exchange Index were top performers for the Partnership, though a long position in the Korean Kospi generated offsetting losses. In currency trading, shorts in both the Japanese Yen and South Korean Won against the US dollar were also profitable, though losses were seen in other positions, notably a long in the New Zealand dollar against the US dollar. Commodity trading, while largely flat, had some of the Partnership s worst performing positions, including shorts in natural gas, gold and copper. In fixed income, the Partnership s net long exposure accounted for most of the Partnership s losses for the month. In February, the Partnership returned positive net of fees, with gains across asset classes led by equities and commodities. The Partnership s long positions in equities did well with boosts from the S P500 and Taiwanese indices. Losses were incurred from shorts in the Hang Seng and Chinese equities. Long credit positions were similarly accretive, driven by European and US high-yielding names. Within commodities, trading in agricultural performed best driven by a short position in corn, whose price fell steadily after a supply and storage surplus, and a long position in cocoa whose price rose significantly. In energies, gains accrued from a short in natural gas, while metals trading detracted, led by copper. In currency, the US dollar s increasing value generated gains for the Partnership s long USD crosses, with the top performer coming against the Japanese yen. Losses were incurred in the British pound and the New Zealand dollar. Fixed income trading was positive, with gains from short positions in short duration instruments, including SOFR and 2-year German bonds. Losses were incurred from long positions in Italian bonds. The Partnership finished the quarter with positive performance in March net of fees, with gains led by equities and currencies, and offsetting losses from fixed income. The Partnership s long positioning in equity indices, particularly in Taiwan, generated gains. Losses were incurred form short positions in the Hang Seng and FTSE China A50 indices. Similar aggregate long positions in credit were also accretive, most notably in US investment-grade and high-yield indices. Trading in currency markets was beneficial in aggregate. The Mexican peso outperformed the US dollar, which was beneficial for the Partnership s long exposure. Short positions in the Japanese yen against multiple currencies generated gains as the currency continued to decline. Losses were experienced trading the Israeli shekel and British pound against the US dollar. Commodities trading was positive in aggregate. Energies returned a positive attribution, driven by a short in US natural gas and long positions in crude oil, whose price rose. The price of gold hit an all-time high, which was positive for the Partnership s long position. Losses from shorts in soybeans and corn took performance across agricultural into the negative despite a positive attribution from long cocoa. Fixed income trading finished the month negative as well, and flat aggregate net positions. The Italian 10-year bund futures performed positively, while a short position in SONIA generated a loss.

Ending Equity 

93,650,760 

Nine months ended September 30, 2023: Net assets decreased 2,323,987 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was attributable to subscriptions in the amount of 1,270,000, redemptions in the amount of 4,846,184 and a net gain from operations of 1,252,197. Management Fees of 2,104,326 and servicing fees of 704,141 were paid or accrued, and interest of 3,266,706 was earned or accrued on the Partnership s share of the Trading Company s cash and cash equivalent investments and broker balances, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Partnership s other expenses paid or accrued for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were 785,211. Three months ended September 30, 2023: Net assets decreased 2,780,826 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was attributable to subscriptions in the amount of 60,000, redemptions in the amount of 1,126,751 and a net loss from operations of 1,714,075. Management Fees of 684,770 and servicing fees of 229,156 were paid or accrued, and interest of 1,140,759 was earned or accrued on the Partnership s share of the Trading Company s cash and cash equivalent investments and broker balances, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

 33 

The Partnership s other expenses paid or accrued for the three months ended September 30, 2023 were 280,144. July was positive for the Partnership s risk assets, with key US indices delivering their fifth successive positive month. The Partnership posted negative returns net of fees with losses in FX, fixed-income and metals and gains from energies, stocks, and credit. Currencies detracted the most in July. Shorts in the Japanese yen against US dollar, Australian dollar and Euro crosses were the main culprits as the currency advanced. In general, long US dollar crosses such as those against the Swiss franc and South Korean won caused pain, while short crosses against commodity currencies such as the Mexican and Colombian pesos generated gains. Fixed income trading also generated losses in aggregate. Long in the Italian 10yr bond detracted the most while shorts in US and Canadian instruments, on the other hand, attributed positively. Commodity markets were more mixed. Metals trading generated losses, with Aluminum in particular bouncing off a multi-month low. Trading in agricultural was flat, with gains from long cocoa positions offsetting losses from short corn. Energies represented the sole bright spot as longs in the crude complex generated gains for the Partnership. Risk-on sentiment provided a tailwind to the Partnership s long credit positions, most notably in investment-grade European names. Equities nudged into the black with gains from longs in the S P500, Italian and Taiwanese indices overcoming losses from shorts in the Hang Seng and H-Shares index. In August, the Partnership generated a negative return net of fees with losses from trading in equities, credit, and commodities, and gains from currencies. The Partnership registered a loss trading the S P 500 index. Additionally, shorts in the MSCI Singapore and MSCI EM indices generated losses. Long credit positions in Europe across both investment grade and high-yield names, implemented via short CDS indices, also lost out. Commodity trading proved difficult, being most acutely observed in metals where silver positioning whipsawed, while US natural gas prices were also volatile. By contrast, gains were made in agricultural through cocoa longs and wheat shorts. Trading in fixed income was flat, although this masks considerable intra-month volatility. Dominantly short positioning was beneficial in the first half of the month, most notably in long-dated US treasuries which, despite losing out in the last week, remained beneficial overall. Positioning in Italian 10-year government bond futures, on the other hand, was long at the start of the month, and was wrongfooted by stubbornly resilient inflation data in Europe. Currency trading was beneficial, particularly from pairs featuring a long US dollar position. The Australian dollar, specifically, fell relative to the US dollar, generating gains for the Partnership; however, a long position in the Brazilian real lost. In September, the Partnership generated a positive return net of fees, driven by fixed income and energy positions. The Partnership s short positions in fixed income, particularly in longer-dated US bonds and Italian bonds were profitable. A short in 3-month Sonia was the sole detractor. Commodity gains were dominated by long oil positions, both Brent and WTI crude. Metals was slightly lower as losses in aluminum and zinc shorts outweighed gains short nickel positions. Within agricultural, long sugar positions generated a gain while long cocoa lost out. Overall, trading in currencies finished in the black, but attributions were mixed. The Partnership saw gains in the Partnership s short Swiss Franc position against the US dollar and offsetting losses from long positions in Sterling against the Japanese Yen and the Australian and US Dollars. Trading in both equities and credit dipped into the red. Longs in the Taiwan MSCI index lost out against prevailing bearishness, while shorts in the MSCI EM and Hang Seng indices gained. Long credit positions generated losses. Three months ended June 30, 2023: In April, the Partnership s FX trading saw profitable short positions in the Japanese yen against the Euro and British pound and losses from its mixed positions in the Swiss franc and Canadian dollar against the US dollar. In equities trading, the Partnership s long positions were generally profitable, along with its short positioning in the VIX volatility index. Long positions in MSCI Taiwan and India s Nifty index generated offsetting losses. Credit trading was slightly positive for the Partnership. Trading in commodities was mixed. Agricultural, in particular a long position in sugar, were the standout, while volatile oil prices were detrimental to the Partnership s positions in oil. Trading in metals was positive, with profits generated from a short zinc position, while a long in copper detracted. The Partnership s small and varied positions in bonds detracted over the month as well. In May, the Partnership generated a positive return net of fees with gains generated across all asset classes. The Partnership s FX trading turned in the strongest performance over the month, most notably long USD crosses as markets perceived possibly more rate rises from the Fed. The Chinese renminbi and Norwegian krone were standouts, while a trade in the Euro against the US dollar lost out as the position flipped from long to short. Within the Partnership s commodities trading, all three sub-components were beneficial. Prices across the soy complex fell, benefitting the Partnership s short positioning, while a long sugar position lost out as prices fell. Energies notched up a small gain in aggregate, benefitting from a US natural gas short. Within metals, long precious positions detracted from the Partnership s returns. Trading in fixed income was also profitable for the Partnership, most notably from shorts in 3m Sonia and UK Gilts. European bonds, on the other hand, rallied sharply, leading to losses from a short Italian government bond position. Equities trading also added to the Partnership s positive returns. Long positions in the Nikkei were the most profitable, and the Partnership s position in the Taiwan MSCI outperformed expectations. The Partnership s credit trading was flat for May. 

 34 

In the month of June, the Partnership generated a positive return, with gains led by fixed income, currency, equity and credit trading, offset by losses in commodities. Fixed income trading turned in the best performance over the month, with shorts continuing to bring in positive returns. Front-end positions had the best returns, notably SONIA and SOFR rates. Further out in the curve, US Treasuries out to the 10-year point performed best, and there were offsetting losses trading French and German bonds. Currency trading maintained its recent strong run, as the Partnership s long position in the Mexican Peso against the US dollar proved profitable. Longs in the British pound against the Japanese yen also generated gains. Losses were incurred in trades on the Australian dollar. Trading in risk assets was also beneficial, most clearly in a short VIX position. Credit spreads tightened, resulting in small gains for the Partnership s long credit positions. Gains also originated from longs in Taiwan s MSCI index and through longs in Japanese stock indices. Losses were incurred in trading the Hang Seng and H-Shares Index. Commodities trading dipped into the red, with energies the principal culprit. Metals and agricultural trading also experienced difficulties, with copper and soybean prices in particular suffering significant reversals. Gains were accrued from a cocoa long, on the other hand. Three months ended March 31, 2023: In January, the Partnership generated a positive return with gains from equity, credit, commodity and FX positions marginally offset by losses in fixed income. The rally in risk assets helped to provide a tailwind to the Partnership s net long equities position. The top performer was a long in the Australian SPI 200 index. A rallying Nasdaq, on the other hand, rising 11 on the month after a -33 return in 2022, did not benefit the Partnership s short position. Losses were also incurred via short in the Korean Kospi. Credit spreads also narrowed over the month, benefitting short protection CDS positions in US investment-grade and European higher-yielding indices. The US-dollar continued to fall from its peak in November 2022, and this trend was best picked up through long positions in commodity currencies, most notably the Mexican and Chilean pesos. Short positions in the Colombian peso and Israeli shekel against the US dollar, on the other hand, generated losses. Profits in commodity trading originated mostly from energy and metals, but with quite different narratives. China s re-awakening was seemingly beneficial for long copper and gold positions while gold s price was supported by a weaker US dollar and expectations that central banks might continue to buy gold to support their de-dollarization . Warm January weather likely contributed to falls in the price of natural gas on both sides of the Atlantic, and profits for the Partnership. Short positions in coffee and platinum generated small losses. Fixed income prices rallied in January on expectations that central banks may ease their rate-hiking plans. Several of the Partnership s short positions, such as Italian and Australian government bond futures, flipped to long, incurring losses in the process. There were no offsetting profitable fixed income positions in January. In February, the Partnership generated a positive return, net of fees, with positive attributions from fixed income and FX, and losses from commodities, stocks and credit. Expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve (the Fed might have more scope to raise rates contributed to a broad sell-off in fixed income instruments, particularly at the short end of the curve. This benefitted the aggregate short positioning in the Partnership, but the greatest beneficiaries were US instruments at the 3m, 2y, and 5-year points. A long position in the UK 10yr gilts, on the other hand, generated a loss. Trading in currencies generated a positive return on the month. The Partnership produced a gain from long USD currency crosses as the US dollar rose on greater expectations of further rate rises from the Fed. Top performers were the Swiss franc and Israeli shekel. Short dollar positions against the Euro and Singapore dollar, on the other hand, lost out. Returns from equities dipped into the red, led by long positions in the Australian SPI 200 and MSCI Emerging Markets indices. Trading in credit fared similarly, with losses in US CDS indices overcoming smaller gains in European indices. Losses in commodities were driven by metals, most notably longs in precious metals, and particularly gold which turned tail, losing 5 in February after three successive winning months. Losses from generally short positions in the oil complex led to an overall negative return in energies. Gains were generated in agricultural trading, however, led by a short in wheat whose price fell for the fifth straight month amid news of changes in Russian and Ukrainian supply, as well as improved forecasts for the US crop. In March, losses were driven by fixed income, equities, and credit positions. A decline of 61bp on 13th of March for US 2-year Treasury yields was the largest decline in over 40 years, was against the prevailing price trend, and was detrimental to a short in the instrument and indeed all other tenors of US treasuries traded by the Partnership. Canadian bonds and the US 5yr treasury generated losses in fixed income trading as all markets were contributed negatively on the month. A long position in the FTSE 100 as well as a short in the Australian SPI 200 detracted the most from an equity standpoint. Risk-on positions in CDS indices also were hurt among a the seeming flight-to-safety, with European and US investment grade companies most clearly in the crosshairs. Commodities trading was relatively unscathed by the crisis in financial markets. A silver position generated a loss as it flipped from short to long as precious metals seemingly benefitted from a flight-to-quality effect. Prices of EUA carbon emissions, on the other hand, fell along with risk assets, generating losses for the Partnership s long position. Sugar trading was beneficial, however, as prices hit a 10-year high, possibly driven in part by declining crop yields resulting from poor weather and a ban on pesticides. Currency trading was mixed, dipping into the red overall. Short positions in safe-haven currencies such as the Swiss franc and Japanese yen generated losses in the flight-to-quality episode. Winning trades exhibited less of a clear pattern; long Euro against the Norwegian krone as well as a long Chilean peso against the US dollar generated a modest gain.

ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Introduction Past Results Are Not Necessarily Indicative of Future Performance The Partnership is a speculative commodity pool. Unlike an operating company, the risk of market sensitive instruments is integral, not incidental, to the Partnership s main line of business. Market movements result in frequent changes in the fair market value of the Partnership s open positions and, consequently, in its earnings and cash flow. The Partnership s market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors, including the level and volatility of interest rates, exchange rates, equity price levels, the market value of financial instruments and contracts, the diversification effects among the Partnership s open positions and the liquidity of the markets in which it trades. The Partnership can rapidly acquire and/or liquidate both long and short positions in a wide range of different markets. Consequently, it is not possible to predict how a particular future market scenario will affect performance, and the Partnership s past performance is not necessarily indicative of its future results. Value at Risk is a measure of the maximum amount which the Partnership could reasonably be expected to lose in a given market sector. However, the inherent uncertainty of the Partnership s speculative trading and the recurrence in the markets traded by the Partnership of market movements far exceeding expectations could result in actual trading or non-trading losses far beyond the indicated Value at Risk or the Partnership s experience to date i.e., risk of ruin ). In light of the foregoing as well as the risks and uncertainties intrinsic to all future projections, the inclusion of the quantification included in this section should not be considered to constitute any assurance or representation that the Partnership s losses in any market sector will be limited to Value at Risk or by the Partnership s attempts to manage its market risk. Materiality, as used in this section Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, is based on an assessment of reasonably possible market movements and the potential losses caused by such movements, taking into account the leverage, optionality and multiplier features of the Partnership s market sensitive instruments. Quantifying the Partnership s Trading Value at Risk Quantitative Forward-Looking Statements The following quantitative disclosures regarding the Partnership s market risk exposures contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor from civil liability provided for such statements by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (set forth in Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). All quantitative disclosures in this section are deemed to be forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor, except for statements of historical fact. The Partnership s risk exposure in the various market sectors traded by the General Partner is quantified below in terms of Value at Risk. Due to the Partnership s mark-to-market accounting, any loss in the fair value of the Partnership s open positions is directly reflected in the Partnership s earnings (realized or unrealized) and cash flow (at least in the case of exchange-traded contracts in which profits and losses on open positions are settled daily through variation margin). For regulatory purposes, exchange initial margin requirements have been used by the Partnership as the measure of its Value at Risk. For trading and internal risk monitoring purposes, a different approach based on simulated market movements is used. Initial margin requirements include a credit risk factor and a maintenance margin factor and thus overstate the maximum one-day loss reflected by the maintenance margin requirement by the amount of the credit risk factor used in setting initial margin requirements. Maintenance margin requirements are set by dealers, exchanges and OTC counterparties to equal or exceed 95-99 of the maximum one-day losses in the fair value of any given contract incurred during the time period over which historical price fluctuations are researched for purposes of establishing margin levels. The maintenance margin levels are established by dealers, exchanges and OTC counterparties using historical price studies as well as an assessment of current market volatility (including the implied volatility of the options on a given futures contract) and economic fundamentals to provide a probabilistic estimate of the maximum expected near-term one-day price fluctuation. In the case of market sensitive instruments that are not exchange traded (almost exclusively currencies in the case of the Partnership), dealers margins have been used as Value at Risk. 

 36 

The fair value of the Partnership s futures and forward positions does not have any optionality component. However, the General Partner may also trade commodity options on behalf of the Partnership. The Value at Risk associated with options would be reflected in the margin requirement attributable to the instrument underlying each option. In quantifying the Partnership s Value at Risk, 100 positive correlation in the different positions held in each market risk category has been assumed. Consequently, the margin requirements applicable to the open contracts have simply been aggregated to determine each trading category s aggregate Value at Risk. The diversification effects resulting from the fact that the Partnership s positions are rarely, if ever, 100 positively correlated have not been reflected. The Partnership s Trading Value at Risk in Different Market Sectors The following table indicates the average, highest and lowest amount of trading Value at Risk associated with the Partnership s open positions by market category as of the period ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Partnership s average quarter-end capitalization was 87,491,755.

Certain total amounts do not foot due to rounding. Average, highest and lowest Value at Risk amounts relate to the quarter-end amounts for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Average capitalization is the Partnership s average quarter-end capitalization for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Material Limitations on Value at Risk as an Assessment of Market Risk The face value of the market sector instruments held by the Partnership is typically many times the applicable initial or maintenance margin requirement (maintenance margin requirements generally ranging between approximately 1 and 10 of contract face value) as well as many times the capitalization of the Partnership. The magnitude of the Partnership s open positions creates a risk of ruin not typically found in most other investment vehicles. Because of the size of its positions, certain market conditions unusual, but historically recurring from time to time could cause the Partnership to incur severe losses over a short period of time. The foregoing Value at Risk table as well as the past performance of the Partnership gives no indication of this risk of ruin. Non-Trading Risk The Partnership has non-trading market risk on its foreign cash balances not needed for margin. However, these balances (as well as any market risk they represent) are immaterial. The Partnership also has non-trading cash flow risk as a result of holding a substantial portion of its assets in U.S. government securities (U.S Treasury Bills) and interest-bearing bank accounts. These investments are placed with highly rated counterparties with a priority placed on preservation of capital and reputation i.e ., appropriate level of credit risk, market risk and reputation risk) and liquidity i.e ., appropriate level of liquidity risk). Qualitative Disclosures Regarding Primary Trading Risk Exposures The following qualitative disclosures regarding the Partnership s market risk exposures except for (i) those disclosures that are statements of historical fact and (ii) the descriptions of how the General Partner manages the Partnership s primary market risk exposures constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act. The Partnership s primary market risk exposures as well as the strategies used and to be used by the General Partner for managing such exposures are subject to numerous uncertainties, contingencies and risks, any one of which could cause the actual results of the Partnership s risk controls to differ materially from the objectives of such strategies. Government interventions, 

 37 

defaults and expropriations, illiquid markets, the emergence of dominant fundamental factors, political upheavals, changes in historical price relationships, an influx of new market participants, increased regulation and many other factors could result in material losses as well as in material changes to the risk exposures and the risk management strategies of the Partnership. There can be no assurance that the Partnership s current market exposure and/or risk management strategies will not change materially or that any such strategies will be effective in either the short- or long-term. Investors must be prepared to lose all or substantially all of their investment in the Partnership. The following were the primary trading risk exposures of the Partnership as of September 30, 2024, by market sector. Fixed Income . Interest rate movements directly affect the price of the sovereign bond futures positions held by the Partnership and indirectly the value of its stock index and currency positions. Interest rate movements in one country as well as relative interest rate movements between countries may materially impact the Partnership s profitability. The Partnership s primary interest rate exposure is to interest rate fluctuations in Italy, Germany, the United States, Japan, Germany and Australia. However, the Partnership also may take positions in futures contracts on the government debt of smaller nations. The General Partner anticipates that G-7 interest rates, both long-term and short-term, will remain the primary market exposure of the Partnership for the foreseeable future. Currencies . Exchange rate risk is the principal market exposure of the Partnership. The Partnership s currency exposure is to exchange rate fluctuations, primarily fluctuations which disrupt the historical pricing relationships between different currencies and currency pairs. These fluctuations are influenced by interest rate changes as well as political and general economic conditions. The Partnership trades in a large number of currencies, including cross-rates i.e., positions between two currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As of September 30, 2024 the Partnership s primary currency exposures were in the U.S. Dollar versus the British Pound, Australian Dollar, New Zealand Dollar, South African Rand and Singapore Dollar. Stock Indices . The Partnership s primary equity exposure, through stock index futures, is to equity price risk in the G-20 countries. As of September 30, 2024, the Partnership s primary exposures were in the MSCI Emerging Market Index, Taiwan MSCI Index, Australian SPI200 Index, DAX Index and MSCI EAFE Index. The Partnership is primarily exposed to the risk of adverse price trends or static markets in the major North American, European, and Asian indices. (Static markets would not cause major market changes but could make it difficult for the Partnership to avoid numerous small losses.) Metals . The AHL Diversified Program used for the Partnership trades precious and base metals. As of September 30, 2024, the Partnership s primary metals market exposures were in Silver, Gold, Copper, and Nickel. Agricultural . The Partnership s has exposure to agricultural price movements, which are often directly affected by severe or unexpected weather conditions. Soybeans, Corn, Coffee and Wheat accounted for the substantial bulk of the Partnership s commodities exposure as of September 30, 2024 Energy. The Partnership s primary energy market exposure is to gas and oil price movements, often resulting from political developments in the Middle East and economic conditions worldwide. Energy prices are volatile and substantial profits and losses have been and are expected to continue to be experienced in this market. As of September 30, 2024, the main exposures were in Crude Oil, Heating Oil, Gas Oil, and Gasoline Qualitative Disclosures Regarding Non-Trading Risk Exposure The following were the only non-trading risk exposures of the Partnership as of September 30, 2024. Foreign Currency Balances . The Partnership s primary foreign currency balance is in British Pound. The Partnership controls the non-trading risk of these balances by regularly converting these balances back into U.S. dollars (no less frequently than twice a month). Cash Positions and Investments in Treasury Bills . The Partnership s only market exposure in instruments held other than for trading is in its cash portfolio and investments in Treasury Bills. The Partnership holds only investments in interest-bearing bank accounts and US Treasury Bills. This cash is placed with highly rated counterparties with a priority placed on preservation of capital and reputation (i.e., appropriate level of credit risk, market risk and reputation risk) and liquidity (i.e., appropriate level of liquidity risk) with durations no longer than 1 year. Qualitative Disclosures Regarding Means of Managing Risk Exposure Risk management is an essential component of AHL s investment management process. AHL has put in place a risk management framework which is designed to identify, monitor and mitigate the portfolio, operational and outsourcing risks relevant to its operations. AHL s risk management framework is part of, and is supported by, the overarching risk management framework of its parent company, Man Group plc. Key principles of AHL s risk management framework include the segregation of functions and 

 38 

duties where material conflicts of interest may arise and having an appropriate degree of independent and senior management oversight of business activities. As part of this independent oversight, AHL s activities are subject to regular review by an internal audit function. The AHL Diversified Program employs a systematic, statistically based investment strategy that is designed to identify and capitalize on trends and other inefficiencies in markets around the world. Trading signals are generated and executed via a finely tuned trading and implementation infrastructure. This process is quantitative, meaning that investment decisions are entirely driven by mathematical models based on quantitative analysis of historical relationships. It is underpinned by rigorous risk control, ongoing research, diversification and the constant quest for efficiency. Portfolio risk management consists primarily of monitoring risk measures and ensuring the systems remain within prescribed limits. The major risk monitoring measures and focus areas include value-at-risk, stress testing, implied volatility, leverage, margin-to-equity ratios and net exposures to sectors and different currencies. Diversification is also a key feature of AHL s risk management, as well as its investment, process. As well as emphasizing sector and market diversification, the AHL Diversified Program has been constructed to achieve diversification by combining various investment strategies. The AHL Diversified Program trades approximately 250 markets and these markets may be accessed directly or indirectly and include, without limitation, stock indices, bonds, currencies, short-term interest rates, energies, credits, metals, agricultural and volatility. Another important aspect of diversification is the fact that the models generate signals across different timeframes, ranging from two to three days to several months. In line with the principle of diversification, the approach to portfolio construction and asset allocation is premised on the importance of deploying investment capital across the full range of sectors and markets. Particular attention is paid to correlation of markets and sectors, expected returns, trading costs and market liquidity. Portfolios are regularly reviewed and, when necessary, adjusted to reflect changes in these factors. AHL also has a systematic process for adjusting its market risk exposure in real time to reflect changes in the volatility, a measure of risk, of individual markets. ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures. The General Partner, with the participation of the General Partner s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Partnership s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024. Based on such evaluation, the General Partner s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that the Partnership s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no significant changes in the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. None. Item 1A. Risk Factors. Risk of Loss. Investing in the Partnership is speculative and involves substantial risks. You should not invest unless you can afford to lose your entire investment. General. The transactions in which the Trading Advisor generally will engage on behalf of the Partnership involve significant risks. Growing competition may limit the Trading Advisor s ability to take advantage of trading opportunities in rapidly changing markets. No assurance can be given that investors will realize a profit on their investment. Moreover, investors may lose all or some of their investment. Because of the nature of the trading activities, the results of the Partnership s operations may fluctuate from month to month and from period to period. Accordingly, investors should understand that the results of a particular period will not necessarily be indicative of results in future periods. Markets Are Volatile and Difficult to Predict. Trading in futures is a speculative activity. Futures prices may be highly volatile. Market prices are difficult to predict and are influenced by many factors, including: changes in interest rates; governmental, agricultural, trade, fiscal, monetary and exchange control programs and policies; weather and climate conditions; changing supply and demand relationships; national and international political and economic events; and the changing philosophies and emotions of market participants. In addition, governments intervene in particular markets from time to time, both directly and by regulation, often with the intent to influence prices. The effects of government intervention may be particularly significant in the financial instrument and currency markets, and may cause such markets to move rapidly. Trading Is Highly Leveraged. The low margin deposits normally required in futures trading permit an extremely high degree of leverage. A relatively small movement in the price of a futures contract may result in immediate and substantial loss or gain to a trader holding a position in such contract. For example, if at the time of purchase 10 of the price of a futures contract is deposited as margin, a 10 decrease in the price of the futures contract would, if the contract were then closed out, result in a total loss of the margin deposit before any deduction for brokerage commissions. Consequently, like other leveraged investments, a futures trade may result in losses in excess of the amount invested. Forward contracts involve similar leverage and also may require deposits of margin as collateral. Swaps and OTC derivative instruments are also highly leveraged transactions. Markets May Be Illiquid. At times, it may not be possible for the Trading Advisor to obtain execution of a buy or sell order at the desired price or to liquidate an open position, either due to market conditions on exchanges or due to the operation of daily price fluctuation limits or circuit breakers. For example, most U.S. commodity exchanges limit fluctuations in most futures contract prices during a single day by regulations referred to as daily price fluctuation limits or daily limits. During a single trading day, no trades may be executed at prices beyond the daily limit. Futures contract prices occasionally have moved to the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading. Even when futures prices have not moved to the daily limit, the Trading Advisor might not be able to obtain execution of trades at favorable prices if little trading in the contracts which the Trading Advisor wishes to trade is taking place. Also, an exchange or governmental authority may suspend or restrict trading on an exchange (or in particular futures traded on an exchange) or order the immediate settlement of a particular instrument. Options trading may be restricted in the event that trading in the underlying instrument becomes restricted. Options trading also may be illiquid at times regardless of the condition of the market in the underlying instrument. In either event, it will be difficult for the Trading Advisor to realize gains or limit losses on option positions by offsetting them or to change positions in the market. Trading in OTC derivative instruments is conducted with individual counterparties rather than on organized exchanges. There have been periods during which forward and swap contract dealers have refused to quote prices for forward and swap contracts or have quoted prices with an unusually wide spread between the bid and asked price. Speculative Position Limits May Restrict Futures Trading. Speculative position limits prescribe the maximum net long or short futures contract and options positions which any person or group may hold or control in particular futures contracts. All futures contracts and options on futures contracts traded on commodity exchanges located in the United States, with the exception of contracts on certain major non-U.S. currencies, are subject to speculative position limits established either by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC or the relevant exchange. 

 40 

All trading accounts owned or managed by the Trading Advisor and its principals will be combined for the purposes of speculative position limits. Such limits could adversely affect the profitability of the Trading Company and, consequently, of the Partnership. For example, the Trading Advisor could be required to liquidate futures positions at an unfavorable time in order to comply with such limits. However, the Trading Advisor does not believe that existing speculative position limits will materially adversely affect its ability to manage the Trading Company s account. Cash Flow. Futures contract gains and losses are marked-to-market daily for purposes of determining margin requirements. Option positions generally are not, although short option positions will require additional margin if the market moves against the position. Due to these differences in margin treatment between futures and options, there may be periods in which positions on both sides must be closed down prematurely due to short term cash flow needs. If this were to occur during an adverse move in a spread or straddle relationship, a substantial loss could occur. Decisions Based on Trends and Technical Analysis. The trading decisions of the Trading Advisor will be based in part on trading strategies which utilize mathematical analyses of technical factors relating to past market performance. The buy and sell signals generated by a technical, trend-following trading strategy are based upon a study of actual daily, weekly and monthly price fluctuations, volume variations and changes in open interest in the markets. The profitability of any technical, trend-following trading strategy depends upon the occurrence in the future of significant, sustained price moves in some of the markets traded. The Trading Company and, consequently, the Partnership may incur substantial trading losses: during periods when markets are dominated by fundamental factors that are not reflected in the technical data analyzed by the program; 

 during prolonged periods without sustained moves in one or more of the markets traded; or 

 during whip-saw markets, in which potential price trends start to develop but reverse before actual trends are realized. 

 In the past there have been prolonged periods without sustained price moves in various markets. Presumably, such periods will recur. A series of volatile reverses in price trends may generate repeated entry and exit signals in trend-following systems, resulting in unprofitable transactions and increased brokerage commission expenses. Technical, trend-following trading systems are used by many other traders. At times, the use of such systems may: result in traders attempting to initiate or liquidate substantial positions in a market at or about the same time; 

 alter historical trading patterns; 

 obscure developing price trends; or 

 affect the execution of trades. 

 Model and Data Risk. The Trading Advisor relies heavily on proprietary mathematical quantitative models (each a Model and collectively, Models and data developed both by the Trading Advisor and those supplied by third parties (collectively, Data rather than granting trade-by-trade discretion to the Trading Advisor s investment professionals. In combination, Models and Data are used to construct investment decisions, to value both current and potential investments (including, without limitation, for trading purposes, and for the purposes of determining the Net Asset Value of the Partnership), to provide risk management insights and to assist in hedging the Partnership s positions and investments. Models and Data are known to have errors, omissions, imperfections and malfunctions (collectively, System Events ). The Trading Advisor seeks to reduce the incidence and impact of System Events, to the extent feasible, through a combination of internal testing, simulation, real-time monitoring and the use of independent safeguards in the overall portfolio management process, often in the software code itself. Despite such testing, monitoring and independent safeguards, System Events will result in, among other things, the execution of unanticipated trades, the failure to execute anticipated trades, delays in the execution of anticipated trades, the failure to properly allocate trades, the failure to properly gather and organize available data, the failure to take certain hedging or risk reducing actions and/or the taking of actions which increase certain risk(s) all of which may have materially adverse effects on the Partnership. System Events in third-party provided Data is generally entirely outside of the control of the Trading Advisor. The research and modeling processes engaged in by the Trading Advisor on behalf of its managed funds is extremely complex and involves the use of financial, economic, econometric and statistical theories, research and modeling; the results of this investment approach must then be translated into computer code. Although the Trading Advisor seeks to hire individuals skilled in each of these functions and to provide appropriate levels of oversight and employ other mitigating measures and processes, the complexity of the individual tasks, the difficulty of integrating such tasks, and the limited ability to perform real world testing of the end product, even with simulations and similar methodologies, raise the chances that Model code may contain one or more coding errors, thus potentially resulting in a System Event and further, one or more of such coding errors could adversely affect the Partnership s investment performance. 

 41 

The investment strategies of the Trading Advisor are highly reliant on the gathering, cleaning, culling and performing of analysis of large amounts of Data. Accordingly, Models rely heavily on appropriate Data inputs. However, it is impossible and impracticable to factor all relevant, available Data into forecasts, investment decisions and other parameters of the Models. The Trading Advisor will use its discretion to determine what Data to gather with respect to each investment strategy and what subset of that Data the Models take into account to produce forecasts which may have an impact on ultimate investment decisions. In addition, due to the automated nature of Data gathering, the volume and depth of Data available, the complexity and often manual nature of Data cleaning, and the fact that the substantial majority of Data comes from third-party sources, it is inevitable that not all desired and/or relevant Data will be available to, or processed by, the Trading Advisor at all times. Irrespective of the merit, value and/or strength of a particular Model, it will not perform as designed if incorrect Data is fed into it which may lead to a System Event potentially subjecting the Partnership to a loss. Further, even if Data is input correctly, model prices anticipated by the Data through the Models may differ substantially from market prices, especially for financial instruments with complex characteristics, such as derivatives, in which the Partnership may invest. Where incorrect or incomplete Data is available, the Trading Advisor may, and often will, continue to generate forecasts and make investment decisions based on the Data available to it. Additionally, the Trading Advisor may determine that certain available Data, while potentially useful in generating forecasts and/or making investment decisions, is not cost effective to gather due to, among other factors, the technology costs or third-party vendor costs and, in such cases, the Trading Advisor will not utilize such Data. The Trading Advisor has full discretion to select the Data it utilizes. The Trading Advisor may elect to use or may refrain from using any specific Data or type of Data in generating forecasts or making trading decisions with respect to the Models. The Data utilized in generating forecasts or making trading decisions underlying the Models may not be (i) the most accurate data available or (ii) free of errors. The Data set used in connection with the Models is limited. The foregoing risks associated with gathering, cleaning, culling and analysis of large amounts of Data are an inherent part of investing with a quantitative, process-driven, systematic adviser such as the Trading Advisor. When Models and Data prove to be incorrect, misleading or incomplete, any decisions made in reliance thereon expose the Partnership to potential losses and such losses may be compounded over time. For example, by relying on Models and Data, the Trading Advisor may be induced to buy certain investments at prices that are too high, to sell certain other investments at prices that are too low, or to miss favorable opportunities altogether. Similarly, any hedging based on faulty Models and Data may prove to be unsuccessful and when determining the Net Asset Value of the Partnership, any valuations of the Partnership s investments that are based on valuation Models may prove to be incorrect. In addition, Models may incorrectly forecast future behavior, leading to potential losses on a cash flow and/or a mark-to-market basis. Furthermore, in unforeseen or certain low-probability scenarios (often involving a market event or disruption of some kind), Models may produce unexpected results which may or may not be System Events. Errors in Models and Data are often extremely difficult to detect, and, in the case of Models, the difficulty of detecting System Events may be exacerbated by the lack of design documents or specifications. Regardless of how difficult their detection appears in retrospect, some System Events may go undetected for long periods of time and some may never be detected. When a System Event is detected, a review and analysis of the circumstances that may have caused a reported System Event will be completed and is overseen by an escalation committee made up of appropriate senior personnel. Following this review, the Trading Advisor, in its sole discretion, may choose not to address or fix such System Event, and the third party software will lead to System Events known to the Trading Advisor that it chooses, in its sole discretion, not to address or fix. The degradation or impact caused by these System Events can compound over time. When a System Event is detected, the Trading Advisor generally will not, as part of the review of circumstances leading to the System Event, perform a materiality analysis on the potential impact of a System Event. The Trading Advisor believes that the testing and monitoring performed on Models and the controls adopted to ensure processes are undertaken with care, will enable the Trading Advisor to identify and address those System Events that a prudent person managing a quantitative, systematic and computerized investment program would identify and address by correcting the underlying issue(s) giving rise to the System Events, but there is no guarantee of the success of such processes. Investors should assume that System Events and their ensuing risks and impact are an inherent part of investing with a process-driven, systematic investment manager such as the Trading Advisor. Accordingly, the Trading Advisor does not expect to disclose discovered System Events to the Partnership or to its investors. The Partnership will bear the risks associated with the reliance on Models and Data including bearing all losses related to System Events other than in relation to losses arising from the Trading Advisor s willful misconduct, negligence or breach of fiduciary obligations. Trade Systems and Execution of Orders. The Trading Advisor relies extensively on computer programs, systems, technology, Data and Models to implement its execution strategies and algorithms. The Trading Advisor s investment strategies, trading strategies and algorithms depend on its ability to establish and maintain an overall market position in a combination of financial instruments selected by the Trading Advisor. There is a risk that the Trading Advisor s proprietary algorithmic trading systems may not be able to adequately react to a market event without serious disruption. Further, trading strategies and algorithms may malfunction causing 

 42 

severe losses. While the Trading Advisor has employed tools to allow for human intervention to respond to significant system malfunctions, it cannot be guaranteed that losses will not occur in such circumstances as unforeseen market events and disruptions and execution system issues. Orders may not be executed in a timely and efficient manner due to various circumstances, including, without limitation, trading volume surges or systems failures attributable to the Trading Advisor, the Trading Advisor s counterparties, brokers, dealers, agents or other service providers. In such event, the Trading Advisor might only be able to acquire or dispose of some, but not all, of the components of such position, or if the overall position were to need adjustment, the Trading Advisor might not be able to make such adjustment. As a result, the Partnership would not be able to achieve the market position selected by the Trading Advisor, which may result in a loss. Trade Error Risk. The complex execution modalities operated by the Trading Advisor and the speed and volume of trading invariably result in occasional trades being executed which, with the benefit of hindsight, were not required or intended by the execution strategy or occasional trades not being executed when they should have been. To the extent a trade error is caused by counterparty, such as a broker, the Trading Advisor generally, to the extent reasonable and practical, attempts to recover any loss associated with such trade error from such counterparty. To the extent a trade error is caused by the Trading Advisor, a formalized process is in place for the documentation and resolution of such trade errors. Given the volume, diversity and complexity of transactions executed by the Trading Advisor on behalf of the Partnership, investors should assume that trade errors will occur on occasion. If such trade errors result in gains to the Partnership, such gains will generally be retained by the Partnership. However, if a trade error result in losses, they will be borne by the Trading Advisor in accordance with its internal policies unless otherwise determined by the General Partner. Trading in OTC Markets Will Expose the Partnership to Risks Not Applicable to Trading on Organized Exchanges. The Partnership, through the Trading Company, may engage in OTC derivative transactions, such as: currency forward contracts traded in the interbank market; options on currency forward contracts; and swap transactions. In general, there is much less governmental regulation and supervision of transactions in the OTC markets than of transactions entered into on organized exchanges. Most of the protections afforded to participants on U.S. and certain non-U.S. exchanges, such as daily price fluctuation limits and the performance guarantee of an exchange clearinghouse, will not be available in connection with OTC transactions. Consequently, the Partnership will be exposed to greater risk of loss through default than if it confined its trading to organized exchanges. A portion of the Partnership s assets may be traded in forward contracts. Such forward contracts are generally not traded on exchanges and are executed directly through forward contract dealers. However, certain forward currency exchange contracts are regulated as swaps by the CFTC and have begun being voluntarily traded on swap execution facilities. Some of these contracts may be required to be centrally cleared by a regulated U.S. clearinghouse, and may be required to be traded on a regulated exchange in the future. There is no limitation on the daily price moves of forward contracts, and a dealer is not required to continue to make markets in such contracts. There have been periods during which forward contract dealers have refused to quote prices for forward contracts or have quoted prices with an unusually wide spread between the bid and asked price. Arrangements to trade forward contracts may therefore experience liquidity problems. The Partnership therefore will be subject to the risk of credit failure or the inability of or refusal of a forward contract dealer to perform with respect to its forward contracts. When trading currency forward contracts, the Trading Company may hedge the foreign currencies in order to limit the Trading Company s exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates. However, there is no guarantee that such hedging will be successful. Enhanced Regulation of the OTC Derivatives Markets. The European Market Infrastructure Regulation EMIR seeks comprehensively to regulate the OTC derivatives market in Europe including, in particular, imposing mandatory central clearing, trade reporting and, for non-centrally cleared trades, risk management obligations on counterparties. Similarly, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Reform Act ), enacted in July 2010, includes provisions that substantially increase the regulation of the OTC derivatives markets. The Reform Act requires that a substantial portion of OTC derivatives must be executed in regulated markets and be submitted for clearing to regulated clearinghouses. For example, certain interest rate swaps, including certain foreign exchange forwards defined as swaps by the CFTC, and credit default index swaps are required by the CFTC to be submitted for clearing if traded by U.S. persons. These OTC trades submitted for clearing are subject to minimum initial and variation margin requirements set by the relevant clearinghouse, as well as margin requirements mandated by the CFTC, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC and/or federal prudential regulators. OTC derivative dealers are also required to post margin to the clearinghouses through which they clear their customers trades instead of using such margin in their operations, as they are allowed to do for uncleared OTC trades. This has further increases the dealers costs, and these increased costs are generally passed 

 43 

through to other market participants in the form of higher upfront and mark-to-market margin, less favorable trade pricing, and the imposition of new or increased fees, including clearing account maintenance fees. The CFTC also requires certain derivatives transactions that were previously executed on a bilateral basis in the OTC markets to be executed through a regulated futures exchange or swap execution facility. Similarly, under EMIR, European regulators may require a substantial proportion of such derivatives transactions to be bought on exchange and/or centrally cleared. The SEC is also expected to impose similar requirements on certain security-based derivatives in the near future, though it is not yet clear when these parallel SEC requirements will go into effect. Such requirements may make it more difficult and costly for investment funds, including the Partnership and/or the Trading Company, to enter into highly tailored or customized transactions. The overall impact of EMIR and the Reform Act on the Partnership is highly uncertain and it is unclear how the OTC derivatives markets will adapt to these new regulatory regimes. Exchanges for Physicals/Swaps/Risk. While not a regular practice for the Trading Company, it may in rare instances engage in transactions known as exchanges for physicals EFP ), exchanges for swaps EFS ), or exchanges for risk/OTC derivatives EFR ). An EFP/EFS/EFR is a purchase or sale of a spot commodity/swap/derivative, as applicable, in conjunction with an offsetting sale or purchase of a corresponding futures contract involving the same or equivalent underlying commodity or instrument, without making an open and competitive trade for the futures contract on the exchange. EFPs, EFSs and EFRs are a permitted exception to the general requirement of the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended, that all futures contracts must be competitively executed on an exchange. They are permitted pursuant to the rules of the relevant exchanges, which vary from exchange to exchange. If the EFP, EFS or EFR does not comply with specific exchange requirements, particularly regarding possessing documentation evidencing possession of the underlying commodity or instrument, then the CFTC or the exchange may deem the transaction to be an illegal off-exchange futures contract. In addition, every EFP, EFS or EFR involves the transfer of an underlying commodity or entry into a swap or derivative on a bilateral basis, as applicable, with a counterparty in exchange for a related cleared futures contract. There is, therefore, counterparty credit risk if the counterparty or its clearing member on the futures leg fails to perform. Unlike other futures contracts that are deemed cleared by the clearinghouse upon trade matching or at the end of the business day, futures contracts arising out of EFPs, EFSs or EFRs may, under various clearinghouse rules, not be deemed accepted by the clearinghouse until the next business day. Options on Futures Contracts May Be More Volatile Than Futures Contracts. The Trading Advisor may trade options on futures contracts. Options are speculative in nature and are highly leveraged. The purchaser of an option risks losing the entire purchase price of the option. The seller (writer) of an option risks losing the difference between the premium received for the option and the price of the underlying futures contract that the writer must purchase upon exercise of the option. Additionally, the seller and writer of the options lose any commissions and fees associated with such transactions. This could subject the writer to unlimited risk in the event of an increase in the price of the contract to be purchased or delivered. Successful trading of options on futures contracts requires a trader to accurately determine near-term market volatility because it often has an immediate impact on the price of outstanding options. Accurate determination of near-term volatility is more important to successful options trading than it is to long-term futures contract trading strategies because such volatility generally does not have as significant an effect on the prices of futures contracts. Trading on Non-U.S. Exchanges and Markets Will Expose the Partnership to Risks Not Applicable to Trading on U.S. Exchanges and Markets. The Partnership, through the Trading Company, may engage in trading on non-U.S. exchanges and markets. The Partnership will be subject to the risk of fluctuations in the currency exchange rate between the local currency and the U.S. dollar and to the possibility of exchange controls. Trading on such exchanges and markets generally involves other risks not applicable to trading on U.S. exchanges and markets. For example, such exchanges and markets: may not provide the same assurances of the integrity (financial and otherwise) of the marketplace and its participants as do U.S. exchanges and markets; 

 may exercise less regulatory oversight and supervision over transactions and participants in transactions; 

 may not afford all participants an equal opportunity to execute trades; 

 may be subject to a variety of political influences and the possibility of direct governmental intervention; 

 may have different clearance and settlement procedures for transactions than U.S. exchanges and markets. There have been times when settlement procedures have been unable to keep pace with the volume of transactions on certain exchanges and markets, making it difficult to conduct trades; and 

 may be principals markets in which performance is the responsibility only of the member with whom the trader has dealt (the counterparty) rather than the responsibility of an exchange or clearing association. Each transaction on such an exchange or market may subject the Partnership to the risk of the counterparty s credit failure or inability or refusal to perform its obligations. 

44 

Institutional Risks. Institutions, such as the banks and brokers, will have custody of the assets of the Partnership. These firms may encounter financial difficulties that impair the operating capabilities or the capital position of the Partnership, the Trading Company or the General Partner. Counterparty Risk. The Partnership will be subject to the risk of the inability of counterparties to perform with respect to transactions, particularly uncleared swap and currency forward transactions, whether due to insolvency, bankruptcy or other causes, which could subject the Partnership to substantial losses. In an effort to mitigate such risks, the General Partner and Trading Advisor will attempt to limit transactions to counterparties, which are established, well-capitalized and creditworthy. Affiliated Parties Conflicts of Interest . Under the terms of the Partnership s Limited Partnership Agreement, the General Partner has the authority to engage trading advisors to make trading decisions for the Partnership. Since the Trading Advisor is an affiliate of the General Partner, the General Partner has a conflict of interest with respect to its responsibilities to manage the Partnership for the benefit of the Limited Partners, and to prevent violations of the Partnership s trading policies and to monitor for excessive trading by the Trading Advisor. In addition, the General Partner has a conflict of interest with respect to its responsibility to review the trading performance of the Partnership and a disincentive to terminate the advisory relationship between the Trading Advisor and the Partnership. There have been no arm s-length negotiations with respect to the management and incentive fees that the Trading Advisor will charge the Trading Company or with respect to the other terms of the advisory agreement entered into with the Trading Advisor. MiFID II . Each of the European Union s re-cast Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (2014/65/EU) (the MiFID II Directive ), the delegated and implementing European Union EU regulations made thereunder, the laws and regulations introduced by Member States of the EU to implement the MiFID II Directive and the EU s Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (600/2014) MiFIR and, together with the MiFID II Directive, MiFID II impose new regulatory obligations on the Trading Advisor. These regulatory obligations may impact on, and constrain the implementation of, the investment strategy of the Partnership and lead to increased compliance obligations upon and accrued expenses for the Trading Advisor and/or the Partnership. Effects of Health Crises and Other Catastrophic Events . Health crises, such as pandemic and epidemic diseases, as well as other catastrophes such as natural disasters, war or civil disturbance, acts of terrorism, power outages and other unforeseeable and external events, that result in disrupted markets and/or interrupt the expected course of events, and public response to or fear of such crises or events, may have an adverse effect on the operations of and, where applicable, investments made by the Partnership and the Trading Company. For example, any preventative or protective actions taken by governments in response to such crises or events may result in periods of regional, national or international business disruption. Such actions may significantly disrupt the operations of the Partnership, the Trading Company, the General Partner and the other service providers to the Partnership. Further, the occurrence and duration of such crises or events could adversely affect economies and financial markets either in specific countries or worldwide. The impact of such crises or events could lead to negative consequences for the Partnership, including, without limitation, significant reduction in the Net Asset Value of the Partnership, reduced liquidity of the Partnership s investments, restrictions on the ability of the Partnership to value its investments and the potential suspension of the calculation of Net Asset Value and the suspension of issues and/or redemptions of Interests.
