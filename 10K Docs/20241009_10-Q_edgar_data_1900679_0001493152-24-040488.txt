The Company must complete one or more initial Business Combinations with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market
value equal to at least of the value of the net assets held in the Trust Account (as defined below) (excluding the deferred underwriting

redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially anticipated to be per Public
Share, plus any pro rata interest then in the Trust Account, net of taxes payable). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion

The
Company will not redeem Public Shares in an amount that would cause its net tangible assets to be less than (so that it does
not then become subject to the SEC s penny stock rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which
may be contained in the agreement relating to the Business Combination. If the Company seeks shareholder approval of the Business Combination,
the Company will proceed with a Business Combination if a majority of the outstanding shares voted are voted in favor of the Business
Combination, or such other vote as required by law or stock exchange rule. If a shareholder vote is not required by applicable law or
stock exchange listing requirements and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other reasons, the Company
will, pursuant to its second amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the Certificate of Incorporation ), conduct
the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and file tender
offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. 

If,
however, shareholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements, or the Company
decides to obtain shareholder approval for business or other reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy
solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If the Company seeks shareholder approval in connection
with a Business Combination, the Sponsor has agreed to vote its Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5) and any Public Shares purchased
during or after the Public Offering in favor of approving a Business Combination. Additionally, each Public Shareholder may elect to
redeem their Public Shares without voting, and if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. 

Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if the Company seeks shareholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the
tender offer rules, the Certificate of Incorporation will provide that a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder
or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more
than an aggregate of of the Public Shares, without the prior consent of the Company. 

The
holders of the Founder Shares have agreed (a) to waive their redemption rights with respect to the Founder Shares and Public Shares held
by them in connection with the completion of a Business Combination and (b) not to propose an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation
(i) to modify the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to allow redemptions in connection with a Business Combination
or to redeem of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period (as defined
below) or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders rights or pre-business combination activity, unless
the Company provides the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment. 

If
the Company has not completed a Business Combination within 12 months (or 15 months, or 18 months, as applicable from the closing of
the Initial Public Offering (the Combination Period ), the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose
of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a
per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the
funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to pay taxes (less up to of interest to pay dissolution expenses),
divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Shareholders rights
as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible
following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s remaining shareholders and the Company s board of directors,
dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors
and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Company s
warrants, which will expire worthless if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. 

The
holders of the Founders Shares have agreed to waive their liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails
to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the holders of Founder Shares acquire Public Shares in
or after the Initial Public Offering, such Public Shares will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if the
Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to
their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination
within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will
be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value
of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the Initial Public Offering price per Unit ).

Subsequent
to the approval by the shareholders of the Company of the Amendment to the Company s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles
of Association (the Charter Amendment ), on July 18, 2023, Company filed the Charter Amendment with the Registrar of Companies

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As

Prior
to the completion of the Initial Public Offering, the Company s liquidity needs had been satisfied through the capital contribution
of from the Sponsor to purchase the Founder Shares, and a loan of up to pursuant to the Note issued to the Sponsor,
which was repaid on January 25, 2022 (Note 5). Subsequent to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering and Private Placement, the
Company s liquidity needs have been satisfied with the proceeds from the consummation of the Private Placement not held in the
Trust Account. 

Based
on the foregoing, management believes that the Company will have sufficient working capital and borrowing capacity to meet its needs
through the earlier of the consummation of a Business Combination or one year from this filing. Over this time period, the Company will
be using these funds for paying existing accounts payable, identifying and evaluating prospective initial Business Combination candidates,
performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting the target business to merge with
or acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Business Combination.

In
connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with the authoritative guidance in Financial
Accounting Standard Board FASB Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties
about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management has determined that the Company currently lacks the
liquidity it needs to sustain operations for a reasonable period of time, which is considered to be at least one year from the date that
the unaudited financial statements are issued as it expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of its acquisition plans. 

In
addition, on June 7, 2024, TETE amended its amended and restated articles of association in existence at that time to give TETE the right
to extend the Combination Period up to seven (7) times for an additional one (1) month each time from June 20, 2024 to January 20, 2025
by depositing into its trust account, for each one-month extension, the lesser of (a) and (b) for each ordinary share outstanding.
The Company subsequently deposited per month into the trust account to extend the Combination Period from June 20, 2024 to October
20, 2024. None of the funds held in trust will be released from the trust account, other than interest income to pay any tax obligations,

statements attributable to us or persons acting on the Company s behalf are qualified in their entirety by this paragraph. 

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial
statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Report. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set
forth below includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. 

Overview 

We
are a blank check company formed under the laws of the Cayman Islands on November 8, 2021. We were formed for the purpose of entering
into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination
with one or more target businesses. While our efforts to identify a target business may span many industries and regions worldwide, we
focus on companies with operations in vision sensing technologies. We intend to effectuate our initial Business Combination using cash
from the proceeds of our Initial Public Offering and the private placement of the Private Units, the proceeds of the sale of our shares
in connection with our initial Business Combination, shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders
or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing. 

We
expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our initial Business Combination. We cannot assure you that our plans
to complete our initial Business Combination will be successful. 

Results
of Operations 

We
have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities from inception through August 31, 2024
were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for our Initial Public Offering, described below, and, after our Initial Public
Offering, identifying a target company for an initial business combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until
after the completion of our initial business combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable
securities held in the Trust Accounts. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting
and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. 

For
the three months ended August 31, 2024, we had a net income of 200,474, which consists of interest earned on investments held
of 408,457, partially offset by formation and operating costs of 207,983. 

For
the three months ended August 31, 2023, we had a net income of 116,225, which consists of formation and operating costs of 307,548,
and interest earned on investments held of 423,773. 

For
the nine months ended August 31, 2024, we had a net income of 724,116, which consists of interest earned on investments held of
 1,302,964, partially offset by formation and operating costs of 578,848. 

For
the nine months ended August 31, 2023, we had a net income of 798,474, which consists of formation and operating costs of 791,818,
and interest earned on investments held of 1,590,292.

Liquidity,
Capital Resources and Going Concern Consideration 

On
January 20, 2022, we consummated our Initial Public Offering of 11,500,000 Units at a price of 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds
of 115,000,000. Simultaneously with the consummation of the initial public offering, we completed the private placement of an aggregate
of 532,500 units to our sponsor at a purchase price of 10.00 per private placement unit, generating total gross proceeds of 5,325,000. 

For
the nine months ended August 31, 2024, cash used in operating activities was 520,384. 

For
the nine months ended August 31, 2023, cash used in operating activities was 701,818. 

As
of August 31, 2024, we had investments of 31,138,174 held in the Trust Accounts. We intend to use substantially all of the funds held
in the Trust Accounts, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Accounts (less taxes paid and deferred underwriting
commissions) to complete our initial business combination. We may withdraw interest to pay taxes. To the extent that our capital stock
or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our initial business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the
Trust Accounts will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions
and pursue our growth strategies. 

As
of August 31, 2024, we had cash of 40,533 outside of the Trust Accounts. We intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Accounts
primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and
from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents
and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete our initial business combination. 

In
order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with our initial business combination, our Sponsor
or an affiliate of our Sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required.
If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that our initial business combination
does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Accounts to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds
from our Trust Accounts would be used for such repayment. Up to 1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into units identical to the
Placement Units, at a price of 10.00 per unit at the option of the lender. 

We
do not currently believe we will need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business.
However, if our estimate of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating our initial
business combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business
prior to our initial business combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our initial business
combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our Public Shares upon consummation of our initial business
combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination. Subject to
compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our initial business
combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we
will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the Trust Accounts. In addition, following our initial business combination, if cash
on hand is insufficient, we may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations. 

The
Company is within 12 months of its mandatory liquidation as of the time of filing this 10-Q. In connection with the Company s assessment
of going concern considerations in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties
about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, the liquidity condition and mandatory liquidation raise substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern until the earlier of the consummation of the Business Combination
or the date the Company is required to liquidate. 

These
financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities
that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Financing Arrangements 

We
have no obligations, assets or liabilities which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements. We do not participate in transactions
that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which
would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. 

We
have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or
commitments of other entities, or entered into any non-financial agreements involving assets.

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons
performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting
officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the fiscal quarter ended August
31, 2024, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive
officer and principal financial and accounting officer have concluded that during the period covered by this Report, our disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

During
the fiscal quarter ended August 31, 2024, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
