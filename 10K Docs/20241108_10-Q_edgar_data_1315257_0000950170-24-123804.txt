million in cash, after post-closing working capital adjustments. We financed the acquisition with cash and available borrowings under our Credit Facility (as defined in Note 11 Debt). Brown Wood is a utility pole treating business with principal operating locations in Alabama and Mississippi. The business we acquired, as well as the sales function, has been operationally integrated into our existing network of utility pole plants and distribution yards. We believe the acquisition, which is included in our RUPS segment, increased our presence in existing markets and offers an attractive entry point to new geographic markets for our utility pole business. Transaction costs, revenue and profit related to the acquisition were not material for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

(1) The difference between total cash consideration and cash paid on the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows relates to the settlement of pre-existing relationships with our PC segment and Brown Wood, as the settlement was deemed additional consideration. 

The customer relationship intangible assets have a useful life of and are amortized on a straight-line basis. Goodwill has been allocated to the Company s RUPS segment. The Company expects the goodwill recognized will be deductible for tax purposes. Recognized goodwill is attributable to the expected synergies and other intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. Loss on Sale of Assets Koppers (China) Carbon Chemical Company Limited (KCCC), which ceased operations in 2015, is owned percent by a wholly owned subsidiary of Koppers and percent by Tangshan Iron Steel Group Co. Ltd. (TISCO). In July 2024, Koppers and TISCO signed an agreement to effectuate the ultimate liquidation of KCCC later in 2024 whereby TISCO will assume the remaining assets, including land, and liabilities of KCCC. As a result, we recorded a loss of approximately million, net of non-controlling interest, during the three months ending September 30, 2024. 

Financial liabilities: 

Long-term debt (including current portion) 

Investments and other assets Represents the broker-quoted cash surrender value on universal life insurance policies. This asset is classified as Level 2 in the valuation hierarchy. Debt The fair value of our long-term debt is estimated based on the market prices for the same or similar issuances or on the current rates offered to us for debt of the same remaining maturities (Level 2). The fair value of our Credit Facility approximates carrying value due to the variable rate nature of this instrument. See Note 12 Derivative Financial Instruments, for the fair value of our derivative financial instruments.

reportable segments: Railroad and Utility Products and Services (RUPS), Performance Chemicals (PC) and Carbon Materials and Chemicals (CMC). Our reportable segments contain multiple aggregated business units since management believes the long-term financial performance of these business units is affected by similar economic conditions. The reportable segments are each managed separately because they manufacture and distribute distinct products with different production processes. Our RUPS segment primarily sells pressure-treated railroad ties to the railroad industry and treated utility poles to utility markets. Railroad products and services include procuring and treating items such as crossties, switch ties and various types of lumber used for railroad bridges and crossings. Utility products include the pressure treatment of transmission and distribution poles for electric, telephone and broadband utilities. In addition, we provide untreated wood products and rail joint bars, which are steel bars used to join rails together for railroads, to the railroad markets and inspection services to the utility markets. We also operate a railroad services business that conducts engineering, design, repair and inspection services for railroad bridges and a business related to the recovery of used crossties, serving the same customer base as our North American railroad business. Our PC segment develops, manufactures, and markets wood preservation chemicals and wood treatment technologies and services to a diverse range of end-markets including residential, industrial, commercial construction and agricultural applications.

Estimated annual effective income tax rate 

Income taxes as a percentage of pretax income were percent and percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, and percent and percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The effective income tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were higher than the 2024 estimated annual effective income tax rate due to the loss on the sale of KCCC's assets. This loss has no corresponding tax benefit since KCCC will not have future income to offset this loss. The effective income tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were slightly different than the 2023 estimated annual effective income tax rate due to various discrete items, which were not material in the aggregate or individually. During the year, management regularly updates estimates of pre-tax income and income tax expense based on changes in pre-tax income projections by taxable jurisdiction, repatriation of foreign earnings, unrecognized tax benefits and other tax matters. Effective January 1, 2024, certain jurisdictions in which we operate have enacted legislation that is consistent with one or more Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules (commonly referred to as "Pillar Two"). These Pillar Two rules include minimum domestic top up taxes, income inclusion rules and undertaxed profit rules all aimed to ensure that multinationals pay a minimum effective corporate tax rate of percent in each jurisdiction in which they operate. We do not expect these Pillar Two rules to materially impact our annual effective rate in 2024. To the extent that actual results vary from these estimates, the actual annual effective income tax rate at the end of the year could be materially different from the estimated annual effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Unrecognized Tax Benefits We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, individual U.S. state jurisdictions and non-U.S. jurisdictions. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, U.S. state, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2017. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , unrecognized tax benefits of million and million, respectively, would affect the effective tax rate if recognized. We do not anticipate material changes to the amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.

million in 2025 and will result in an estimated settlement loss of million, before tax, subject to changes to certain assumptions including the discount rate, which could have a material impact on the settlement loss. Of the estimated settlement loss, we expect that million, before tax, will be incurred in the fourth quarter of 2024 with the remainder being recognized in the first quarter of 2025.

million, which is subject to adjustment as a result of subsequent data cleansing activities. Under the terms of this buy-in insurance policy, the insurer is liable to pay the benefits of the plan, but the plan still retains full legal responsibility to pay the benefits to members using the insurance payments. The buy-in policy will be treated as a plan asset going forward until such time as the buy-in policy is converted to a buy-out policy, which is when individual insurance policies will be assigned to each member of the plan and the plan will no longer have legal responsibility to pay the benefits to the members. The data cleansing effort has been substantially completed and we expect to recognize a pre-tax pension settlement loss of approximately million upon the pension obligation becoming irrevocably settled. The timing of the conversion to a buy-out policy and related recognition of the estimated pension settlement loss may be impacted by a ruling from the High Court of Justice in the United Kingdom in the case of Virgin Media Limited v NTL Pension Trustees II Limited and Others related to certain amendments to UK pension plans. On July 25, 2024, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal of the ruling from the High Court of Justice. We are currently waiting to see if there will be legislative intervention or further guidance on the application of the ruling.

Credit Facility We have a credit agreement (the Credit Facility) with a consortium of banks. The Credit Facility provides for an million revolving credit facility, a million swingline facility and provides for the ability to incur one or more uncommitted incremental revolving or term loan facilities in an aggregate amount of at least million, subject to applicable financial covenants. The interest rate on the Credit Facility is variable and may be based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), which is the applicable benchmark for current borrowings, or an alternative benchmark depending on the borrowing type. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the assets (excluding real property and other customary assets) of Koppers Inc., Koppers Holdings Inc. and our material domestic subsidiaries. The Credit Facility contains certain covenants that may limit Koppers Inc. and its restricted subsidiaries from taking certain actions. These limitations include, among others, restrictions on additional indebtedness, liens, dividends, investments, acquisitions, certain distributions, asset sales, transactions with affiliates and modifications to material documents, including organizational documents. In addition, such covenants may give rise to events of default upon the failure by Koppers Inc. and its restricted subsidiaries to meet certain financial ratios. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately million of unused revolving credit availability after restrictions from certain letter of credit commitments and other covenants. As of September 30, 2024, million of commitments were utilized by outstanding letters of credit.

percent of face value, resulting in million of net proceeds, before debt financing costs. In April 2024, the Term Loan B was upsized by issuing, at par, an additional million of incremental term loans, before debt financing costs. The interest rate on the Term Loan B is variable and is based on, at our option, adjusted Term SOFR Rate or adjusted Daily Simple SOFR. The interest rate margins applicable to adjusted Term SOFR Rate or adjusted Daily Simple SOFR loans are percent with a floor of percent. period in an amount equal to percent of the principal amount, with the balance due at maturity on .

 months and we have hedged certain volumes of copper through the end of 2025. We designate certain of our commodity swaps as cash flow hedges of forecasted purchases of commodities. For those commodity swaps where hedge accounting is not elected, the fair value of the commodity swap is recognized as an asset or liability on the condensed consolidated balance sheet and the related unrealized gain or loss on the derivative is reported in current earnings. These amounts are classified in cost of sales in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. We enter into heating oil swap contracts to manage price risk associated with fuel oil purchases for our plant operations and certain raw material requirements. The fair value associated with these swap contracts are not designated as hedges, and the related unrealized gain or loss on the derivative is reported in current earnings. These amounts are classified in cost of sales in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , we had contracts totaling million and million gallons, respectively. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency risk associated with our receivable and payable balances in addition to foreign-denominated sales. The fair value associated with forward contracts related to foreign currency that are not designated as hedges, and the related unrealized gain or loss on the derivative is reported in current earnings. These amounts are classified in cost of sales in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. We enter into interest rate swaps to effectively convert portions of our variable interest rate debt into fixed rate debt to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements. We entered into interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional value of million at a weighted average fixed SOFR rate of percent for a portion of our variable rate debt. All swap agreements expire in April 2027 . The interest rate swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges on interest payments involving the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for us making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.

Currently, at the properties acquired from Beazer East (which includes the National Priorities List site and all but one of the sites permitted under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)), a significant portion of all investigative, cleanup and closure activities are being conducted and paid for by Beazer East pursuant to the terms of the Indemnity. In addition, other of Koppers Inc. s sites are or have been operated under RCRA and various other environmental permits, and remedial and closure activities are being conducted at some of these sites. To date, the parties that retained, assumed and/or agreed to indemnify us against the liabilities referred to above, including Beazer East, have performed their obligations in all material respects. Periodically, issues have arisen between Koppers Inc. and Beazer East and/or other indemnitors that have been resolved without arbitration. Koppers Inc. and Beazer East engage in discussions from time to time that involve, among other things, the allocation of environmental costs related to certain operating and closed facilities. If for any reason (including disputed coverage or financial incapability) one or more of such parties fail to perform their obligations and we are held liable for or otherwise required to pay all or part of such liabilities without reimbursement, the imposition of such liabilities on us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Furthermore, we could be required to record a contingent liability on our balance sheet with respect to such matters, which could result in a negative impact to our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Domestic Environmental Matters. Koppers Inc. has been named as one of the potentially responsible parties (PRPs) at the Portland Harbor CERCLA site located on the Willamette River in Oregon. Koppers Inc. operated a coal tar pitch terminal near the site. Koppers Inc. has responded to an EPA information request and has executed a PRP agreement which outlines a private process to develop an allocation of past and future costs among more than parties to the site. Koppers Inc. believes it is a de minimis contributor at the site. The EPA issued its Record of Decision (ROD) in January 2017 for the Portland Harbor CERCLA site. The selected remedy includes a combination of sediment removal, capping, enhanced and monitored natural recovery and riverbank improvements. The ROD does not determine who is responsible for remediation costs. At that time, the net present value and undiscounted costs of the selected remedy as estimated in the ROD were approximately billion and billion, respectively. These costs are likely to increase given recent submissions to EPA regarding remedy design and because the remedy will not be implemented for several years. Responsibility for implementing and funding that work is yet to be determined. The funding of that work amongst the PRPs is the subject of a separate private allocation process which is ongoing. Additionally, Koppers Inc. is involved in two separate matters involving natural resource damages at the Portland Harbor site. One matter involves claims by the trustees to recover damages based upon an assessment of damages to natural resources caused by the releases of hazardous substances to the Willamette River. The assessment serves as the foundation to estimate liabilities for settlements of natural resource damages claims or litigation to recover from those who do not settle with the trustee groups. Koppers Inc. has been engaged in a process to resolve its natural resource damage liabilities for the assessment area. A second matter involves a lawsuit filed in January 2017 by the Yakama Nation in Oregon federal court. Yakama Nation seeks recovery for response costs and the costs of assessing injury to natural resources in waterways beyond the current assessment area. Following the most recent court rulings, the Yakama Nation case has been stayed pending completion of the private allocation process for the Portland Harbor CERCLA site. In September 2009, Koppers Inc. received a general notice letter stating that it may be a PRP at the Newark Bay CERCLA site. In January 2010, Koppers Inc. submitted a response to the general notice letter asserting that Koppers Inc. is a de minimis party at this site. We have accrued the estimated costs of participating in the PRP group at the Portland Harbor and Newark Bay CERCLA sites and estimated de minimis contributor settlement amounts at the sites totaling million as of September 30, 2024. The actual cost could be materially higher as there has not been a determination of how those costs will be allocated among the PRPs at the sites. Accordingly, an unfavorable resolution of these matters may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. 

 17 

plant sites related to the Performance Chemicals business and plant site related to the Utility and Industrial Products business in the United States where we have recorded environmental remediation liabilities for soil and groundwater contamination which occurred prior to our acquisition of the businesses. As of September 30, 2024, our estimated environmental remediation liability for these acquired sites totals million. In June 2024, Koppers Inc. received a letter stating that the Illinois Attorney General s Office (IL AGO) received an enforcement referral from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency relating to certain alleged air emissions violations at our Stickney, IL facility. We are cooperating with IL AGO in connection with this matter. We have not provided a reserve for the Stickney, IL enforcement matter because, at this time, we cannot reasonably determine the probability of a loss, and the amount of loss, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated. The timing of resolution of this matter cannot be reasonably determined. Although Koppers Inc. is vigorously defending this matter, an unfavorable resolution of this matter may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Foreign Environmental Matters . There is plant site related to the Performance Chemicals business located in Australia where we have recorded an environmental remediation liability for soil and groundwater contamination which occurred prior to the acquisition of the business. As of September 30, 2024 , our estimated environmental remediation liability for the acquired site totals million. Environmental Reserves Rollforward. million and million, respectively, were classified as current liabilities .

 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited financial statements and related notes included in Item 1 of this Part I as well as the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Overview 
 We are a leading integrated global provider of treated wood products, wood preservation chemicals and carbon compounds. Our products and services are used in a variety of niche applications in a diverse range of end-markets, including the railroad, specialty chemical, utility, residential lumber, agriculture, aluminum, steel, rubber and construction industries. We serve our customers through a comprehensive global manufacturing and distribution network, with manufacturing capabilities in North America, South America, Australasia and Europe. We operate three principal businesses: RUPS, PC and CMC. 
 Through our RUPS business, we believe that we are the largest supplier of railroad crossties to the Class I railroads in North America. Our other treated wood products include utility poles for the electric, telephone, and broadband utility industries in the United States and Australia and construction pilings in the United States. In addition, we provide untreated wood products and rail joint bars to the railroad markets and inspection services to the utility markets. We also operate a railroad services business that conducts engineering, design, repair and inspection services for railroad bridges and a business related to the recovery of used crossties, serving the same customer base as our North American railroad business. 
 Through our PC business, we believe that we are the global leader in developing, manufacturing and marketing wood preservation chemicals and wood treatment technologies for use in the pressure treating of lumber for residential, industrial and agricultural applications. 
 19 

Our CMC business processes coal tar into a variety of products, including creosote, carbon pitch, carbon black feedstock, naphthalene and phthalic anhydride, which are intermediate materials necessary in the pressure treatment of wood, and the production of aluminum, steel, carbon black, high-strength concrete, plasticizers and specialty chemicals . 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We utilize certain financial measures that are not in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) to analyze and manage the performance of our business. We believe that adjusted EBITDA provides information useful to investors in understanding the underlying operational performance of the company, our business and performance trends, and facilitates comparisons between periods. The exclusion of certain items permits evaluation and a comparison between periods of results for business operations, and it is on this basis that our management internally assesses our performance. Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure of profitability we use to evaluate our businesses. In addition, adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure used to determine the level of achievement of management's short-term incentive goals and related payout, as well as one of the measures used to determine performance and related payouts for certain performance share units granted to management. 
 Although we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures enhance investors understanding of our business and performance, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP financial measures and should be read in conjunction with the relevant GAAP financial measures. Other companies in a similar industry may define or calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as income before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and other adjustments. These other adjustments are items that we believe are not representative of underlying business performance. Adjusted items typically include certain expenses associated with impairment, restructuring and plant closure costs, significant gains and losses on asset disposals or business combinations, LIFO, mark-to-market commodity hedging and other unusual items. The LIFO expense adjustment removes the entire impact of LIFO and effectively reflects the results as if we were on a FIFO inventory basis. See Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation in the below section for the reconciliation from net income to adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis. 
 We do not provide reconciliations of guidance for adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS to comparable GAAP measures, in reliance on the unreasonable efforts exception. We are unable, without unreasonable efforts, to forecast certain items required to develop meaningful comparable GAAP financial measures. These items include, but are not limited to, restructuring and impairment charges, acquisition-related costs, mark-to-market commodity hedging, and LIFO adjustments that are difficult to forecast for a GAAP estimate and may be significant. 
 Outlook 
 After considering the current intensely competitive environment, global economic conditions, as well as ongoing uncertainty associated with geopolitical and supply chain challenges, we anticipate taking measures to streamline our organization to support an increasingly cost-conscious customer base. These actions will ensure that we extend our decade-long growth in profitability and support a higher margin profile by leveraging a smaller global team highly focused on serving customer preferences. The following summarizes our 2024 financial goals, which are supported by these actions: 
 sales of approximately 2.1 billion, 

adjusted EBITDA of approximately 270 million to 275 million, and 

capital expenditures, including capitalized interest but excluding acquisitions, of approximately 80 million with approximately 20 million of the total allocated to discretionary projects. 

Our keys to success for 2024 include streamlining the organization in addition to our original 2024 objectives, which are: 
 For our RUPS segment, we need to (i) recoup cost increases, including the value of our creosote preservative in the market, (ii) ensure our facilities run uninterrupted to serve customer demand, (iii) maximize opportunities for increased volumes, including expanding our customer base into the Texas utility pole market, (iv) lower costs and (v) successfully integrate the Brown Wood asset acquisition with our domestic utility pole business. 

For our PC segment, we need to (i) increase market share for certain newer product lines, (ii) maintain volumes and margin and (iii) reduce operating costs. 

20 

For our CMC segment, we need to (i) optimize production from our yield enhancement project in Nyborg, Denmark, (ii) push acceptance of petroleum-blended products, which mitigates reductions in coal tar volumes and (iii) execute on domestic plant optimization projects. 

Significant market indicators for our businesses include: 
 The Railway Tie Association s estimate of total crosstie installations in 2024 is approximately 19.6 million ties, with approximately 13.4 million for Class I railroads. This is slightly higher than 2023 crosstie installations of approximately 19.2 million crossties with the small increase expected to be from Class I railroads. We expect the crosstie market to remain stable. 

According to BMO Capital Markets, market demand for utility poles is expected to remain high throughout 2024 as a result of aging pole infrastructure, efforts to strengthen poles against larger and more frequent storms, and a need to add larger poles to support continued electrification and expansion of broadband access. In 2024, we have experienced a decrease in our legacy utility pole business due to temporary customer overstock and budget realignment. 

Product demand for our PC business has historically been associated with consumer spending on home repair and remodeling projects in North America. The Leading Indicator of Remodeling Activity (LIRA) reported by the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University reported a mild pullback in 2024 compared to the prior year; however, annual homeowner renovation and maintenance expenditures are expected to grow by 1.2 percent through the third quarter of 2025. Volumes may also be impacted by customer market share shifts as contracts are negotiated for 2025. While the LIRA projects a decrease in 2024, the outlook for our PC business for the remainder of the year remains relatively positive driven by improvements in the industrial markets we serve and expected flat volumes for our residential business, inclusive of any market share changes in 2024. 

For the external markets served by our CMC business, we have experienced a slowdown in the near-term in manufacturing overall as well as in the steel, aluminum and carbon black industries. The availability of coal tar, the primary raw material for our CMC business, is linked to levels of metallurgical coke production. As the global steel industry, excluding Asia, has reduced the production of steel using metallurgical coke, the volumes of coal tar have been reduced. We are actively working to mitigate the impacts of the long-term decline of coal tar supply by gaining market acceptance for petroleum-blended products. We are also investing in projects to increase distillation yields and balance raw material supply and cost with customer demand and pricing. 

Our businesses and results of operations are affected by various competitive and other factors including (i) the impact of global economic conditions on demand for our products, including the impact of imported products from competitors in certain regions where we operate; (ii) raw material pricing and availability, in particular the cost and availability of hardwood lumber for railroad crossties, softwood lumber for utility poles, scrap copper prices, and the cost and amount of coal tar available in global markets, which is negatively affected by reductions in blast furnace steel production; (iii) volatility in oil prices, which impacts the cost of coal tar and certain other raw materials, as well as selling prices and margins for certain of our products including carbon black feedstock, phthalic anhydride, and naphthalene; (iv) competitive conditions in our performance chemicals business and global carbon pitch markets; and (v) changes in foreign exchange rates. Any or all of these or other factors could impact our actual results for 2024. 
 Seasonality and Effects of Weather on Operations 
 Our quarterly operating results fluctuate due to a variety of factors that are outside of our control, including inclement weather conditions, which in the past have affected operating results. Operations at some of our facilities have at times been reduced during the winter months. Moreover, demand for some of our products declines during periods of inclement weather. As a result of the foregoing, we anticipate that we may experience material fluctuations in quarterly operating results. Historically, our operating results have been significantly lower in the first and fourth calendar quarters as compared to the second and third calendar quarters.

RUPS net sales increased largely due to 10.0 million of price increases, mainly for domestic crossties and utility poles in Australia, an 11 percent increase in the volume of domestic utility poles sold driven by our acquisition of Brown Wood and an increase in activity in our railroad bridge services business. These increases were partly offset by lower activity in our crosstie recovery business. 
 PC net sales decreased primarily as a result of sales to the recently acquired Brown Wood no longer being included in our reported sales beginning April 1, 2024. Slightly higher volumes, excluding Brown Wood, were offset by lower sales prices. 
 CMC net sales decreased mainly due to 16.6 million of lower sales prices across most products, especially carbon pitch where prices were down approximately 20 percent globally, along with lower volumes of carbon black feedstock. The decreases in carbon pitch prices were driven by market dynamics in the current year period, particularly in Europe. These decreases were partly offset by volume increases for carbon pitch and phthalic anhydride. Foreign currency changes compared to the prior year period from our international markets had a favorable impact on sales in the current year period of 1.8 million. 
 Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was 78 percent, compared to 80 percent in the prior year period as lower raw material costs were partly offset by the market driven reduction in sales prices. Significant items impacting cost of sales in individual operating segments are discussed as part of "Segment adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin" herein. 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses were 3.6 million higher when compared to the prior year period as a result of recent capital expenditures including growth projects such as the expansion of our facility in North Little Rock, Arkansas, as well as the acquisition of Brown Wood, both within our RUPS segment. 
 Loss on sale of assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was related to the liquidation of our former coal tar distillation facility located in China. See Note 2 Acquisition and Loss on Sale of Assets. 
 Interest expense was 1.2 million higher when compared to the prior year period due to higher borrowings. 
 Income tax expense increased by 2.3 million when compared to the prior year period due primarily to higher income before income taxes. The income excludes the loss on the sale of KCCC's assets, which does not have a corresponding tax benefit. See Note 8 Income Taxes.

RUPS adjusted EBITDA was essentially flat as net sales increases and 3.4 million from improved plant utilization were offset by 14.1 million of higher raw material, operating and selling, general and administrative expenses. 
 PC adjusted EBITDA increased despite the net decrease in sales, on lower raw material and logistics costs, which were favorably impacted by timing. 
 CMC adjusted EBITDA increased due to 9.2 million of lower raw material costs, particularly in Europe, lower selling, general and administrative costs and higher volumes of carbon pitch and phthalic anhydride. These favorable drivers were partly offset by price decreases and higher operating expenses.

RUPS net sales increased largely due to 28.8 million of pricing increases primarily for crossties and utility poles, along with higher volumes for crossties and utilities poles and an increase in activity in our railroad bridge services business, partly offset by lower activity in our crosstie recovery business. Volumes in our domestic utility pole business increased 3.2 percent as an increase from our acquisition of Brown Wood was partly offset by a decrease in our legacy utility pole business due to temporary customer overstock and budget realignment. 
 PC net sales decreased due primarily to sales to the recently acquired Brown Wood of approximately 6 million no longer being included in our reported sales beginning April 1, 2024 and lower pricing of 4.8 million in the Americas, partly offset by a 1.5 percent volume increase in the Americas for our copper-based preservatives. 
 CMC net sales decreased largely due to 72.7 million of lower sales prices across most products, especially carbon pitch where prices were down approximately 24 percent globally, along with 12.9 million of lower volumes of carbon pitch and carbon black feedstock. The decreases in carbon pitch prices and volumes were driven by reduced market demand in the current year period. These decreases were partly offset by volume increases for phthalic anhydride. 
 Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was 79 percent, compared to 80 percent in the prior year period as lower raw material costs were partly offset by the market driven reduction in sales. Significant items impacting cost of sales in individual operating segments are discussed as part of "Segment adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin" herein. 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses were 9.5 million higher when compared to the prior year period as a result of recent capital expenditures including growth projects such as the expansion of our RUPS facility in North Little Rock, Arkansas and the yield enhancement project at our CMC facility in Nyborg, Denmark, as well as the acquisition of Brown Wood. We also recognized accelerated depreciation of 1.5 million for certain decommissioned assets at our North Little Rock, Arkansas facility. Additionally, asset retirement obligations in our European CMC operations and the related depreciation expense increased during the first quarter of 2024 when compared to the prior year period. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses were 6.2 million higher when compared to the prior year period due mainly to an increase in compensation-related costs along with an increase in professional service and insurance expenses. 
 Loss on sale of assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was related to the liquidation of our former coal tar distillation facility located in China while the gain on sale of assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was related to a sale of assets at that same facility. See Note 2 Acquisition and Loss on Sale of Assets. 
 Interest expense was 4.6 million higher when compared to the prior year period due to higher borrowings and interest rates, partly offset by the write-off of debt issuance costs in 2023. 
 Income tax expense decreased by 2.9 million when compared to the prior year period due primarily to lower income before income taxes. See Note 8 Income Taxes.

RUPS adjusted EBITDA increased due primarily to net sales increases and 11.2 million from improved plant utilization, which combined to more than offset 39.8 million of higher raw material, operating and selling, general and administrative expenses. 
 PC adjusted EBITDA increased despite lower sales, as a result of lower raw material costs offsetting lower sales prices and higher selling, general and administrative costs. Lower raw material costs were favorably impacted by timing, including an increase in gains realized from our copper-hedging program, net of an increase in the cost of scrap copper recognized to date. 
 CMC adjusted EBITDA decreased as a result of lower sales prices, which were partly offset by a 42.6 million reduction in raw material costs, particularly in Europe, as well as higher operating expenses and lower plant utilization, partly offset by lower selling, general and administrative costs and higher volumes of phthalic anhydride.

Cash Flow 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 44.7 million compared to 79.5 million in the prior year. For both periods, the primary source of cash was net income, excluding non-cash items, less working capital usage. Higher working capital usage in the current year was primarily driven by a reduction in accounts payable as a result of the timing of inventory purchases and vendor payments. 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 154.4 million compared to 88.3 million in the prior year. The increase was due to cash paid for the Brown Wood acquisition, partly offset by lower capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were higher in the prior year period due to investment in growth projects, such as the expansion of our RUPS facility in North Little Rock, Arkansas which was completed in the fourth quarter of 2023 and a yield enhancement project at our CMC facility in Nyborg, Denmark which was completed in the first quarter of 2024. 
 24 

Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 88.4 million compared to 31.6 million in the prior year. The primary source of financing cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was net borrowings of 138.9 million and the primary uses of financing cash flows were repurchases of common stock, including payments related to taxes withheld under stock-based compensation plans, and dividends paid. In the prior year, the primary source of financing cash flows was net borrowings of 46.9 million and the primary uses of financing cash flows were repurchases of common stock, payments of debt issuance costs and dividends paid. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, liquidity was approximately 332 million. Our Credit Facility is described in Note 11 Debt. 
 Our need for cash in the next twelve months relates primarily to capital spending, purchase commitments, operating leases, working capital, debt service, pension plan funding, dividends, share repurchases, voluntary pension plan contributions, including pension plan terminations, and to fund cost savings initiatives. We may also use cash to pursue other potential strategic acquisitions. Capital expenditures in 2024, excluding acquisitions, are expected to total approximately 80 million and are expected to be funded by cash from operations. We anticipate that our liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months, and based on our current expectations, for the foreseeable future. 
 We manage our working capital to increase our flexibility to pay down debt. The amount of our outstanding debt and our overall cash flows will fluctuate throughout any operating period based upon, among other things, the timing of receipts from customers and payments to vendors. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 90 percent of accounts payable was current and ten percent was 1-30 days past due. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 85 percent of accounts payable was current and 15 percent was 1-30 days past due. 
 Restrictions on Dividends to Koppers Holdings 
 Koppers Holdings depends on the dividends from the earnings of Koppers Inc. and its subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet its financial obligations, including the payment of any declared dividend of Koppers Holdings. The Credit Facility permits Koppers Inc. to make dividend payments to Koppers Holdings if certain conditions are met, including, among other permitted dividend payments, the ability to fund the payment of regularly scheduled dividends on Koppers Holdings common stock and repurchases of Koppers Holdings common stock, in an aggregate amount per year not to exceed the greater of (a) 50.0 million in any fiscal year, with unused amounts in any fiscal year being carried over to the succeeding fiscal year, and (b) 6.0 percent of market capitalization. 
 Bank Debt Covenants 
 The bank debt covenants that affect availability of the Credit Facility and which may restrict the ability of Koppers Inc. to pay dividends include the following financial ratios: 
 The total net leverage ratio is calculated as of the last day of each fiscal quarter in accordance with the Credit Facility definitions of consolidated total net debt divided by consolidated EBITDA and is not permitted to exceed 5.0. The total net leverage ratio as of September 30, 2024 was 3.3. Effective during the second quarter of 2025, the total net leverage ratio will not be permitted to exceed 4.75. 

The cash interest coverage ratio, calculated as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, is not permitted to be less than 2.0. The cash interest coverage ratio as of September 30, 2024 was 4.0. 

We are currently in compliance with all covenants governing the Credit Facility. Our continued ability to meet these financial covenants may be affected by events beyond our control.
