 Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired recorded on the acquisition date of an entity. During the measurement period, the Company may record subsequent adjustments to goodwill for provisional amounts recorded at the acquisition date. 
 Goodwill is subject to impairment testing, which must be conducted at least annually or upon the occurrence of a triggering event. Various factors, such as the Company s results of operations, the trading price of the Company s common stock relative to the book value per share, macroeconomic conditions and conditions in the banking sector, inform whether a triggering event for an interim goodwill impairment test has occurred. Goodwill is recorded and evaluated for impairment at its reporting unit, the Company. The Company s policy is to test goodwill for impairment annually as of October 1st, or on an interim basis if an event triggering an impairment assessment is determined to have occurred.

 As of September 30, 2024, no allowance for credit losses has been recognized on available for sale securities in an unrealized loss position as management does not believe any of the securities are impaired due to reasons of credit quality. This belief is based upon our analysis of the underlying risk characteristics, including credit ratings, and other qualitative factors related to our available for sale securities and in consideration of our historical credit loss experience and internal forecasts. The issuers of these securities continue to make timely principal and interest payments under the contractual terms of the securities. Furthermore, management does not have the intent to sell any of the securities classified as available for sale in the table above and believes that it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell any such securities before a recovery of cost. The unrealized losses are due to increases in market interest rates over the yields available at the time the underlying securities were purchased. The fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity date or repricing date or if market yields for such investments decline.

 Credit Quality Indicators 
 The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt. The Company utilizes a risk rating matrix to assign a risk rating to each of its loans. Risk ratings are updated on an ongoing basis and are subject to change by continuous loan monitoring processes including lending management monitoring, executive management and board committee oversight, and independent credit review. As part of the ongoing monitoring of the credit quality of the Company s loan portfolio and methodology for calculating the allowance for credit losses, management assigns and tracks certain risk ratings to be used as credit quality indicators including trends related to (1) the weighted-average risk grade of loans, (2) the level of classified loans, (3) the delinquency status of loans, (4) nonperforming loans and (5) the general economic conditions in our market. Individual bankers, under the oversight of credit administration, review updated financial information for all pass grade commercial loans to reassess the risk grade on at least an annual basis. When a loan reaches a set of internally designated criteria, including Substandard or higher, a special assets officer will be involved in the monitoring of the loan on an on-going basis. 
 The following is a general description of the risk ratings used by the Company: 
 Pass Credits in this category contain an acceptable amount of risk. 
 Special Mention Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution s credit position at some future date. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 
 Substandard Loans classified as substandard have well-defined weaknesses on a continuing basis and are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the borrower, declining collateral values, or a continuing downturn in their industry which is reducing their profits to below zero and having a significantly negative impact on their cash flow. These loans so classified are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 
 Doubtful Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. 
 Loss Loans classified as loss are to be charged-off or charged-down when payment is acknowledged to be uncertain or when the timing or value of payments cannot be determined. Loss is not intended to imply that the loan or some portion of it will never be paid, nor does it in any way imply that there has been a forgiveness of debt.

 Allowance for Credit Losses on Unfunded Commitments 
 
 In addition to the allowance for credit losses on loans, the Company has established an allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments, classified in other liabilities and adjusted as a provision for credit loss expense. The allowance represents estimates of expected credit losses over the contractual period in which there is exposure to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on the commitments expected to fund. The estimate of commitments expected to fund is informed by historical analysis looking at utilization rates. The expected credit loss rates applied to the commitments expected to fund is informed by the general valuation allowance utilized for outstanding balances with the same underlying assumptions and drivers. The allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was million and million, respectively. This reserve is maintained at a level management believes to be

 Collateral Dependent Loans 
 Collateral dependent loans are secured by real estate assets, accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. For a collateral dependent loan, the Company s evaluation process includes a valuation by appraisal or other collateral analysis adjusted for selling costs, when appropriate. This valuation is compared to the remaining outstanding principal balance of the loan and any loss is included in the allowance for credit losses on loans as a specific allocation.

 Commitments to Extend Credit 
 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being fully drawn upon, the total commitment amounts disclosed do not necessarily represent future cash funding requirements. The Company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The Company minimizes its exposure to loss under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures. Management assesses the credit risk associated with certain commitments to extend credit in determining the level of the allowance for credit losses. The amount and type of collateral, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer. 
 Commitments to make loans are generally made for an approval period of 120 days or less. As of September 30, 2024, the fixed rate loan commitments had interest rates ranging from to with a weighted average maturity of years and a weighted-average rate of . 
 Standby Letters of Credit 
 Standby letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. In the event of nonperformance by the customer, the Company has the rights to the underlying collateral. The credit risk to the Company in issuing letters of credit is substantially similar to that involved in extending loan facilities to its customers. The Company s policy for obtaining collateral, and the nature of such collateral, is substantially similar to that involved in making commitments to extend credit.

 Overview 
 We generate most of our income from interest income on loans, interest income from investments in securities and service charges on customer accounts. We incur interest expense on deposits and other borrowed funds and noninterest expenses such as salaries and employee benefits and occupancy expenses. Net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense on liabilities such as deposits and borrowings that are used to fund those assets. Net interest income is our largest source of revenue. To evaluate net interest income, we measure and monitor (1) yields on our loans and other interest-earning assets, (2) the interest expenses of our deposits and other funding sources, (3) our net interest spread and (4) our net interest margin. Net interest spread is the difference between rates earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is calculated as net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Because noninterest-bearing sources of funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and shareholders equity, also fund interest-earning assets, net interest margin includes the benefit of these noninterest-bearing sources. 
 Our net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as a volume change. Periodic changes in the volume and types of loans in our loan portfolio are affected by, among other factors, economic and competitive conditions in Texas and specifically in our market, as well as developments affecting the real estate, technology, financial services, insurance, transportation, manufacturing and energy sectors within our market and throughout the state of Texas. 
 Our net interest income is also affected by changes in yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and borrowed funds, referred to as a rate change. Fluctuations in market interest rates are driven by many factors, including governmental monetary policies, inflation, deflation, macroeconomic developments, changes in unemployment, the money supply, political and international conditions and conditions in domestic and foreign financial markets.

Critical Accounting Policies 
 Certain of our accounting estimates are important to the portrayal of our financial condition, since they require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances. Facts and circumstances that could affect these judgments include, but are not limited to, changes in interest rates, changes in the performance of the economy and changes in the financial condition of borrowers. Management believes that determining the allowance for credit losses is its most critical accounting estimate. Our accounting policies are discussed in detail in Note 1 Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 
 The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account which represents management s best estimate of lifetime expected losses based on reasonable and supportable forecasts, historical loss experience, and other qualitative considerations. Management considers the policies related to the allowance for credit losses as the most critical to the financial statement presentation. The Company bases its estimates of credit losses on three primary components: (1) estimates of expected losses that exist in various segments of performing loans over the remaining life of the loan portfolio using a reasonable and supportable economic forecast, (2) specifically identified losses in individually analyzed credits which are collateral-dependent, which generally include nonaccrual loans and purchased credit deteriorated PCD loans and (3) qualitative factors related to economic conditions, portfolio concentrations, regulatory policy updates, and other relevant factors that address estimates of expected losses. Estimating the timing and amounts of future losses is subject to management s judgment as these projected cash flows rely upon the estimates discussed above and factors that are reflective of current or future expected conditions using analytical and forecasting models and tools. Volatility in certain credit metrics and differences between expected and actual outcomes are to be expected. For example, customers may not repay their loans according to the original terms, and the collateral securing the payment of those loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance. 
 
 Loans with similar risk characteristics are aggregated into homogenous pools and are collectively evaluated by applying reserve factors, such as historical lifetime loss, concentration risk, volume, growth and composition of the loan portfolio, current and forecasted economic conditions to amortized cost balances over the remaining contractual life of the collectively evaluated portfolio. Historical lifetime loss is determined by utilizing an open-pool cumulative loss rate methodology, adjusted for credit risk characteristics and current and forecasted economic conditions. Losses are predicted over a reasonable and supportable period of one year for all loan pools, followed by an immediate reversion to long-term historical averages. The reasonable and supportable period and reversion period are re-evaluated as needed by the Company and are dependent on the current economic environment among other factors. 
 
 Loans that no longer share risk characteristics with the collectively evaluated loan pools are evaluated on an individual basis and are excluded from the collectively evaluated pools. In order to assess which loans are to be individually evaluated, the Company follows a loan review program to evaluate the credit risk in the total loan portfolio and assigns risk grades to each loan. Individual credit loss estimates are typically performed for nonaccrual loans, modified loans classified as troubled loan modifications and all other loans identified by management. All loans deemed as being individually evaluated are reviewed on a quarterly basis in order to determine whether a specific reserve is required. The Company considers certain loans to be collateral dependent if the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and management expects repayment for the loan to be substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral. For collateral dependent loans, loss estimates are based on the fair value of collateral, less estimated cost to sell (if applicable). Collateral values supporting individually evaluated loans are assessed quarterly and appraisals are typically obtained at least annually. The Company allocates a specific loan loss reserve on an individual loan basis primarily based on the value of the collateral securing the individually evaluated loan. Through this loan review process, the Company assesses the overall quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses on loans while considering risk elements attributable to particular loan types in assessing the quality of individual loans. In addition, for each category of loans, the Company considers secondary sources of income and the financial strength and credit history of the borrower and any guarantors. 
 
 A change in the allowance for credit losses on loans can be attributable to several factors, most notably historical lifetime loss, specific reserves for individually evaluated loans and changes in qualitative factors and growth within the loan portfolio. The estimated loan losses for all loan pools are adjusted for changes in qualitative factors not inherently considered in the quantitative analyses to bring the allowance to the level management believes is appropriate based on factors that have not otherwise been fully accounted for, including adjustments for foresight risk, input imprecision and model imprecision. The qualitative categories and the measurements used to quantify the risks within each of these categories are subjectively selected by management, but measured by objective measurements period over period. The data for each measurement may be obtained from internal or external sources. The current period measurements are evaluated and assigned a factor commensurate with the current level of risk relative to past measurements over time. The resulting qualitative adjustments are applied to the relevant collectively evaluated loan portfolios. These 
 37 

Table of Content s 

adjustments are based upon quarterly trend assessments in portfolio concentrations, changes in lending policies and procedures, policy exceptions, independent loan review results, internal risk ratings and peer group credit quality trends. Additional qualitative considerations are made for any identified risk which did not exist within our portfolio historically and therefore may not be adequately addressed through evaluation of such risk factors based on historical portfolio trends. Qualitative adjustments also include current and forecasted economic conditions primarily measured by local and national economic metrics, such as GDP, unemployment rates, interest rates and oil and gas prices based on historical and forecasted economic research scenarios provided by industry-leading financial intelligence and analytical solutions, which the Company has subscribed to. The qualitative allowance allocation is increased or decreased for each loan pool based on the assessment of these various qualitative factors. Management recognizes the sensitivity of various assumptions made in the quantitative modeling of expected losses and may adjust reserves depending upon the level of uncertainty that currently exists in one or more assumptions. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, based on sensitivity analyses across all segments of the performing loan portfolio, a 5 increase in historical loss rates would have increased funded reserves by 1.8 million. On the other hand, a 5 increase in each qualitative risk factor across all segments (where assigned) would have increased funded reserves by 3.0 million. Increasing estimated loss rates by 5 (i.e., quantitative and qualitative) would have a 3.6 million impact. 
 
 The allowance for credit losses could be affected by significant downturns in circumstances relating to loan quality and economic conditions and as such may not be sufficient to cover expected losses in the loan portfolio which could necessitate additional provisions or a reduction in the allowance for credit losses if our assumption prove to be incorrect. Unanticipated changes and events could have a significant impact on the financial performance of borrowers and their ability to perform as agreed. We may experience significant credit losses if borrowers experience financial difficulties, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. 
 
 Goodwill 
 
 Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. During the measurement period, the Company may record subsequent adjustments to goodwill for provisional amounts recorded at the acquisition date. 
 
 Goodwill is subject to impairment testing, which must be conducted at least annually or upon the occurrence of a triggering event. Goodwill is recorded and evaluated for impairment at its reporting unit, the Company. The Company s policy is to test goodwill for impairment at least annually as of October 1st, or on an interim basis if an event triggering an impairment assessment is determined to have occurred. Various factors, such as the Company s results of operations, the trading price of the Company s common stock relative to the book value per share, macroeconomic conditions and conditions in the banking sector, inform whether a triggering event for an interim goodwill impairment test has occurred. The impairment test compares the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its net book value. If the unit s fair value is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized in our results of operations in the periods in which they become known in an amount equal to this excess. 
 
 See Note 2 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Company s goodwill and intangibles. 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Refer to Note 1 of the Company s consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements that have been adopted by the Company or that will require enhanced disclosures in the Company s financial statements in future periods. 
 Results of Operations 
 Net income was 33.9 million, or 0.63 per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 30.9 million, or 0.58 per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net income was primarily due to a 8.3 million decrease in the provision for credit losses and a 1.6 million increase in noninterest income partially offset by a 5.2 million decrease in net interest income and a 1.4 million increase in the provision for income taxes. 
 Annualized returns on average assets, returns on average equity and efficiency ratios were 1.27 , 8.49 and 66.18 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 1.14 , 8.34 and 63.50 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing total noninterest expense by the sum of net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding net gains and losses on the sale of loans, securities and assets. Additionally, taxes and provision for loan losses are not part of the efficiency ratio calculation.

Net income was 89.8 million, or 1.68 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 103.2 million, or 1.94 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net income was primarily due to a 25.8 million decrease in net interest income partially offset by a 11.7 million decrease in the provision for credit losses and a 1.4 million decrease in the provision for income taxes. 
 Annualized returns on average assets, returns on average equity and efficiency ratios were 1.13 , 7.73 and 66.33 , respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 1.28 , 9.52 and 61.02 , respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net Interest Income 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with three months ended September 30, 2023. Net interest income before the provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 101.5 million compared with 106.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 5.2 million, or 4.9 , primarily due to the increase in the cost of funds and average interest-bearing liabilities and the decrease in average loans more than offsetting the increase in interest income due to increased rates on interest-earning assets. 
 Interest income was 151.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 507 thousand, or 0.3 , compared with 151.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher-yielding securities and loans offsetting a decrease in interest-earning assets. The yield on the securities portfolio increased to 3.49 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.68 for the same period in 2023. Average interest-earning assets decreased 53.9 million, or 0.6 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due the decrease in average loans partially offset by increases in securities and deposits in other financial institutions. Average loans to average interest earning assets decreased to 79.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 82.9 for the same period in the prior year. Additionally, interest income from purchase accounting adjustments was 6.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 12.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest expense was 50.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 5.7 million, or 12.8 , compared with 44.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to higher funding costs on interest-bearing deposits due to higher interest rates and an increase in average interest-bearing deposits liabilities partially offset by a decrease in average borrowed funds. The cost of average interest-bearing liabilities increased to 3.54 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.22 for the same period in 2023. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased 153.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase in average interest-bearing deposits partially offset by a decrease in average borrowed funds. 
 Tax equivalent net interest margin, defined as net interest income adjusted for tax-free income divided by average interest-earning assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 4.19 , a decrease of 18 basis points compared to 4.37 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis was primarily due to increased funding costs. The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities of 3.54 and the average yield on interest-earning assets of 6.26 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 32 basis points and 7 basis points, respectively, over the same period in 2023. Tax equivalent adjustments to net interest margin are the result of increasing income from tax-free securities and loans by an amount equal to the taxes that would have been paid if the income were fully taxable based on a 21 federal tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, thus making tax-exempt yields comparable to taxable asset yields.

This increase was primarily due to higher interest rates on interest-bearing deposits and an increase in average interest-bearing liabilities. The cost of average interest-bearing liabilities increased to 3.50 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.68 for the same period in 2023. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased 244.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase in certificates and other time deposits and interest-bearing demand deposits partially offset by a decrease in money market and savings deposits along with borrowed funds. 
 Tax equivalent net interest margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 4.23 , a decrease of 32 basis points compared to 4.55 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis was primarily due to increased funding costs.

 Provision for Credit Losses 
 Our allowance for credit losses is established through charges to income in the form of the provision in order to bring our allowance for credit losses for various types of financial instruments including loans, unfunded commitments and securities to a level deemed appropriate by management. We recorded a reversal of provision for credit losses of 6.0 million and 3.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a provision for credit losses of 2.3 million and 7.9 million, respectively. The reversal of provision for credit losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the decrease in loans outstanding and changes to the specific reserves within the allowance for credit losses model, among other things. See further discussion of the allowance for credit losses in Financial Condition-Asset Quality. 
 Noninterest Income 
 Our primary sources of noninterest income are service charges on deposit accounts, debit card and ATM income and income earned on bank-owned life insurance. Noninterest income does not include loan origination fees which are recognized over the life of the related loan as an adjustment to yield using the interest method. 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with three months ended September 30, 2023 . Noninterest income totaled 6.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared with 4.7 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 1.6 million, or 34.2 , primarily due to 1.3 million of Small Business Investment Company income recognized in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with nine months ended September 30, 2023 . Noninterest income totaled 18.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 17.7 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 338 thousand, or 1.9 , primarily due to a 1.1 million increase in Small Business Investment Company income along with an increase in gain on sale of assets in 2024 compared to 2023 partially offset by decreased debt card and ATM income due the impact of the Durbin Amendment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

 Noninterest Expense 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with three months ended September 30, 2023. Noninterest expense was 71.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 70.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 318 thousand, or 0.4 , primarily due to an increase of 1.6 million in salaries and employee benefits, a 908 thousand increase in data processing and software amortization and a 717 increase in professional fees partially offset by decreased acquisition and merger-related expenses of 3.4 million and a 664 thousand decrease in amortization of intangibles. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with nine months ended September 30, 2023. Noninterest expense was 213.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 212.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 1.1 million, or 0.5 , primarily due to a 5.0 million increase in salaries and employee benefits, a 1.1 million increase in net occupancy and equipment, a 1.6 million increase in data processing and software amortization, a 1.9 million increase in professional fees and a 5.3 million increase in other noninterest expenses partially offset by a 12.5 million decrease in acquisition and merger-related expenses and a 2.0 million decrease in amortization of intangibles.

Salaries and employee benefits. Salaries and benefits increased 1.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 5.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to annual salary increases, increases in full-time equivalent employees and severance expense of 505 thousand and 956 thousand recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 Data processing and software amortization. Data processing and software amortization increased 908 thousand during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 1.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to increased software expense . 
 Professional fees. Professional fees increased 717 thousand during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 1.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to increased consulting fees for various projects, some of which related to the Company s assets crossing the 10 billion threshold. 
 Acquisition and merger-related expenses. Acquisition and merger-related expenses of 3.4 million and 12.5 million incurred during the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, were primarily related to compensation, legal and advisory fees associated with the merger between Allegiance Bancshares, Inc. and CBTX, Inc, which was effective on October 1, 2022. No acquisition and merger-related expenses were incurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Amortization of intangibles . Amortization of intangibles decreased 664 thousand and 2.0 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 Efficiency Ratio 
 The efficiency ratio is a supplemental financial measure utilized in management s internal evaluation of our performance. We calculate our efficiency ratio by dividing total noninterest expense by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income, excluding net gains and losses on the sale of loans, securities and assets. Additionally, taxes and provision for credit losses are not part of this calculation. An increase in the efficiency ratio indicates that more resources are being utilized to generate the same volume of income, while a decrease would indicate a more efficient allocation of resources. Our efficiency ratio was 66.18 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 63.50 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 66.33 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 61.02 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 We monitor the efficiency ratio in comparison with changes in our total assets and loans, and we believe that maintaining or reducing the efficiency ratio during periods of growth demonstrates the scalability of our operating platform. We expect to continue to benefit from our scalable platform in future periods as we continue to monitor overhead expenses necessary to support our growth. 
 Income Taxes 
 The amount of federal and state income tax expense is influenced by the amount of pre-tax income, tax-exempt income and other nondeductible expenses. Income tax expense increased 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and decreased 1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same periods in 2023 primarily due to the changes in pre-tax net income. Our effective tax rate was 20.7 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 19.4 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Our lending activities originate from the efforts of our bankers with an emphasis on lending to individuals, professionals, small- to medium-sized businesses and commercial companies generally located in our market. Our strategy for credit risk management generally includes well-defined, centralized credit policies, uniform underwriting criteria and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for credit exposures. The strategy generally emphasizes regular credit examinations and management reviews of loans. We have certain lending policies and procedures in place that are designed to maximize loan income within an acceptable level of risk. We maintain an independent loan review which includes third-party loan review services to review the credit risk on a periodic basis. The internal loan review department focuses on credits not reviewed by the third-party loan reviewer to ensure more complete coverage of credit risk. Results of these reviews are presented to management and the risk committee of the Board of Directors. The loan review process complements and reinforces the risk identification and assessment decisions made by bankers and credit personnel and contained in our policies and procedures. 
 The principal categories of our loan portfolio are discussed below: 
 Commercial and Industrial. We make commercial and industrial loans in our market area that are underwritten on the basis of the borrower s ability to service the debt from income. In general, commercial loans involve more credit risk than residential mortgage loans and commercial mortgage loans and therefore typically yield a higher return. The increased risk in commercial loans derives from the expectation that commercial and industrial loans generally are serviced principally from the operations of the business, which may not be successful and from the type of collateral securing these loans. As a result, commercial and industrial loans require more extensive underwriting and servicing than other types of loans. Our commercial and industrial loan portfolio decreased by 61.1 million, or 4.3 , to 1.35 billion as of September 30, 2024 from 1.41 billion as of December 31, 2023. 
 Paycheck Protection Program PPP ). The balance of PPP loans decreased 2.2 million to 2.9 million as of September 30, 2024 from 5.1 million as of December 31, 2023 due to loan forgiveness.

Commercial Real Estate (Including Multi-Family Residential) . We make loans collateralized by owner-occupied, nonowner-occupied and multi-family real estate to finance the purchase or ownership of real estate. Our commercial real estate loan portfolio decreased 95.5 million, or 2.3 , to 3.98 billion as of September 30, 2024 from 4.07 billion as of December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 47.1 and 46.6 , respectively, of our commercial real estate loans were owner-occupied. Our commercial real estate portfolio includes 415.0 million of multi-family residential loans as of September 30, 2024 and 488.8 million as of December 31, 2023. We had 225 multi-family residential loans with an average loan size of 1.9 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our commercial real estate (including multi-family residential) loan portfolio included 233.3 million of multifamily community development loans with associated tax credits, which fund Texas-based projects to promote affordable housing, compared to 298.9 million as of December 31, 2023. 
 Commercial Real Estate Construction and Land Development. We make commercial real estate construction and land development loans to fund commercial construction, land acquisition and real estate development construction. Construction loans involve additional risks as they often involve the disbursement of funds with the repayment dependent on the ultimate success of the project s completion. Sources of repayment for these loans may be pre-committed permanent financing or sale of the developed property. The loans in this portfolio are monitored closely by management. Due to uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs, the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation on real property, it can be difficult to accurately evaluate the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan to value ratio. As a result of these uncertainties, construction lending often includes the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project rather than the ability of a borrower or guarantor to repay the loan. Commercial real estate construction and land development loans decreased 170.1 million, or 16.0 , to 890.3 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to 1.06 billion as of December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 12.8 and 21.1 , respectively, of our commercial real estate construction and land development loans were owner-occupied. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our commercial real estate construction and land development portfolio included 137.1 million of construction and development loans to support multifamily community development loans with associated tax credits, which fund Texas-based projects to promote affordable housing, compared to 80.5 million as of December 31, 2023. 
 1-4 Family Residential (Including Home Equity). Our residential real estate loans include the origination of 1-4 family residential mortgage loans (including home equity and home improvement loans and home equity lines of credit) collateralized by owner-occupied residential properties located in our market areas. Our residential real estate portfolio (including home equity) increased 65.1 million, or 6.2 , compared to December 31, 2023 to 1.11 billion as of September 30, 2024. 
 Residential Construction. We make residential construction loans to home builders and individuals to fund the construction of single-family residences with the understanding that such loans will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the homes by builders or with the proceeds of a mortgage loan. These loans are secured by the real property being built and are made based on our assessment of the value of the property on an as-completed basis. Our residential construction loans portfolio decreased 105.9 million, or 39.6 , to 161.5 million as of September 30, 2024 from 267.4 million as of December 31, 2023. 
 Consumer and Other. Our consumer and other loan portfolio is made up of loans made to individuals for personal purposes and deferred fees and costs on all loan types. Generally, consumer loans entail greater risk than residential real estate loans because they may be unsecured or if secured the value of the collateral, such as an automobile or boat, may be more difficult to assess and more likely to decrease in value than real estate. In such cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan balance. The remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower beyond obtaining a deficiency judgment. In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability, and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws may limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans. Our consumer and other loan portfolio decreased 4.3 million, or 6.6 , to 60.0 million as of September 30, 2024 from 64.3 million as of December 31, 2023.

 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 The allowance for credit losses is a valuation allowance that is established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for (or reversal of) credit losses calculated in accordance with ASC 326 that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of certain assets to present the net amount expected to be collected. The amount of each allowance account represents management s best estimate of current expected credit losses on these financial instruments considering available information, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument. Relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. While historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses, adjustments to historical loss information may be made for differences in current portfolio-specific risk characteristics, environmental conditions or other relevant factors. While management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the ultimate adequacy of our allowance accounts is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control, including the performance of our portfolios, the economy, changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward classification of assets. For additional information regarding critical accounting estimates and policies, refer to Critical Accounting Estimates in this section, Note 1 Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies and Note 4 Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans 
 The allowance for credit losses on loans represents management s estimates of current expected credit losses in the Company s loan portfolio. Pools of loans with similar risk characteristics are collectively evaluated, while loans that no longer share risk characteristics with loan pools are evaluated individually. 
 At September 30, 2024 , our allowance for credit losses on loans was 84.5 million, or 1.12 of total loans , compared with 91.7 million, or 1.16 of total loans, as of December 31, 2023. Th e decrease in the allowance for credit losses on loans during 2024 primarily resulted from changes to the specific reserves within the allowance for credit losses model along with lower loan balances, among other things. The following table presents, as of and for the periods indicated, an analysis of the allowance for loan losses and other related data:

 Allowance for Credit Losses on Unfunded Commitments 
 The allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments estimates current expected credit losses over the contractual period in which there is exposure to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by us. The allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments is a liability account reported as a component of other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and is adjusted as a provision for credit loss expense. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on the commitments expected to fund. The estimate of commitments expected to fund is affected by historical analysis looking at utilization rates. The expected credit loss rates applied to the commitments expected to fund are affected by the general valuation allowance utilized for outstanding balances with the same underlying assumptions and drivers. At September 30, 2024 , our allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments was 10.0 million compared to 11.3 million at December 31, 2023.

Available for Sale Securities 
 We use our securities portfolio to provide a source of liquidity, to provide an appropriate return on funds invested, to manage interest rate risk and to meet pledging and regulatory capital requirements. As of September 30, 2024, the carrying amount of investment securities totaled 1.69 billion, an increase of 296.1 million, or 21.2 , compared with 1.40 billion as of December 31, 2023 . Securities represented 15.9 and 13.1 of total assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively . 
 All of the securities in our securities portfolio are classified as available for sale. Securities classified as available for sale are measured at fair value in the financial statements with unrealized gains and losses reported, net of tax, as accumulated comprehensive income or loss until realized. Interest earned on securities is included in interest income. The following tables summarize the amortized cost and fair value of the securities in our securities portfolio as of the dates shown:

 Investment securities classified as available for sale or held to maturity are evaluated for expected credit losses under ASC 326. See Note 3 Securities in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Management does not have the intent to sell any of these securities and believes that it is more likely than not that the Company will not have to sell any such securities before a recovery of cost. The fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity date or repricing date or if market yields for such investments decline. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2024, management believes that the unrealized losses detailed in the previous table are due to noncredit-related factors, including changes in interest rates and other market conditions, and therefore, no losses have been recognized in the Company s consolidated statements of income.

 The contractual maturity of mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations is not a reliable indicator of their expected life because borrowers may have the right to prepay their obligations. Mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are typically issued with stated principal amounts and are backed by pools of mortgage loans with varying maturities. The term of the underlying mortgages and loans may vary significantly due to the ability of a borrower to prepay and, in particular, monthly pay downs on mortgage-backed securities tend to cause the average life of the securities to be much different than the stated contractual maturity. During a period of increasing interest rates, fixed rate mortgage-backed securities do not tend to experience heavy prepayments of principal and, consequently, the average life of this security will be lengthened. If interest rates begin to fall, prepayments may increase, thereby shortening the estimated life of the security. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we did not own securities of any one issuer (other than the U.S. government and its agencies or sponsored entities) for which the aggregate adjusted cost exceeded 10 of our consolidated shareholders equity. 
 The average yield of our securities portfolio was 3.22 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 2.72 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in average yield during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to the mix of higher-yielding securities within the portfolio.

Goodwill and Core Deposit Intangibles 
 Our goodwill was 497.3 million as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Goodwill resulting from business combinations represents the excess of the consideration paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is assessed annually for impairment and on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. 
 Our core deposit intangibles, net, as of September 30, 2024 was 98.1 million and 116.7 million as of December 31, 2023. Core deposit intangibles are amortized using the straight-line or an accelerated method over the estimated useful life of seven to ten years. 
 Deposits 
 Our lending and investing activities are primarily funded by deposits. We offer a variety of deposit accounts having a wide range of interest rates and terms including demand, savings, money market and certificates and other time accounts. We rely primarily on convenient locations, personalized service and our customer relationships to attract and retain these deposits. We seek customers that will engage in both a lending and deposit relationship with us. 
 Total deposits at September 30, 2024 were 8.74 billion, a decrease of 130.9 million, or 1.5 , compared with 8.87 billion at December 31, 2023 primarily driven by industry-wide pressures and the maintenance of pricing discipline in an intensely competitive market for deposits. Noninterest-bearing deposits at September 30, 2024 were 3.30 billion, a decrease of 243.8 million, or 6.9 , compared with 3.55 billion at December 31, 2023.

 Borrowings 
 We have an available line of credit with the Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB of Dallas, which allows us to borrow on a collateralized basis. FHLB advances are used to manage liquidity. The advances are secured by a blanket lien on certain loans. Maturing advances are replaced by drawing on available cash, making additional borrowings or through increased customer deposits. At September 30, 2024, we had a total borrowing capacity of 2.98 billion, of which 1.86 billion was available and 1.12 billion was outstanding pursuant to FHLB advances and letters of credit. There were 60.0 million of FHLB short-term advances outstanding at September 30, 2024 at a weighted-average rate of 5.15 .

Credit Agreement 
 On December 13, 2022, Stellar entered into a loan agreement with another financial institution (the Loan Agreement that provides for a 75.0 million revolving line of credit. At September 30, 2024, there were no outstanding borrowings on this line of credit and no draws were taken on this line of credit during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Draws can be made on the line of credit for a period of 24 months, which will end December 13, 2024. Interest accrues on outstanding borrowings at a per annum rate equal to the prime rate quoted by The Wall Street Journal and with a floor rate of 3.50 calculated in accordance with the terms of the revolving promissory note and payable quarterly through the first 24 months. The entire outstanding balance and unpaid interest is payable in full on December 13, 2024. The obligations of Stellar under the Loan Agreement are secured by a pledge of all the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Bank. 
 Covenants made under the Loan Agreement include, among other things, while there are obligations outstanding under Loan Agreement, the Company shall maintain a cash flow to debt service (as defined in the Loan Agreement) of not less than 1.25, the Bank s Texas Ratio (as defined in the Loan Agreement) not to exceed 25.0 and the Bank shall maintain a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio (as defined under the Loan Agreement) of at least 7.0 and restrictions on the ability of Stellar and its subsidiaries to incur certain additional debt. As of September 30, 2024, the Company believes it was in compliance with all such debt covenants and had not been made aware of any noncompliance by the lender. 
 Junior Subordinated Debentures 
 In connection with the acquisitio n of F M Bancshares, Inc. in 2015, Stellar assumed Farmers Merchants Capital Trust II and Farmers Merchants Capital Trust III. Each of the trusts is a capital or statutory business trust organized for the sole purpose of issuing trust securities and investing the proceeds in Stellar's junior subordinated debentures. The preferred trust securities of each trust represent preferred beneficial interests in the assets of the respective trusts and are subject to mandatory redemption upon payment of the junior subordinated debentures held by the trust. The common securities of each trust are wholly owned by Stellar.. Each trust s ability to pay amounts due on the trust preferred securities is solely dependent upon Stellar making payment on the related junior subordinated debentures. The debentures, which are the only assets of each trust, are subordinate and junior in right of payment to all of the Company s present and future senior indebtedness. Stellar has fully and unconditionally guaranteed each trust s obligations under the trust securities issued by each trust to the extent not paid or made by such trust, provided such trust has funds available for such obligations. The trust preferred securities bear a floating rate of interest equal to 3-Month SOFR plus a spread adjustment. The junior subordinated debentures are included in Tier 1 capital under current regulatory guidelines and interpretations. Under the provisions of each issue of the debentures, Stellar has the right to defer payment of interest on the debentures at any time, or from time to time, for periods not exceeding five years. If interest payments on either issue of the debentures are deferred, the distributions on the applicable trust preferred securities and common securities will also be deferred.

 Subordinated Notes 
 In December 2017, the Bank issued 40.0 million aggregate principal amount of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes (the Bank Notes due December 15, 2027. The Bank Notes bear a floating rate of interest equal to 3-Month SOFR plus a spread adjustment until the Bank Notes mature on December 15, 2027, or such earlier redemption date, payable quarterly in arrears. The Bank Notes are redeemable by the Bank, in whole or in part, upon the occurrence of certain specified tax events, capital events or investment company events. Any redemption will be at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of Bank Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, and will be subject to, and require, prior regulatory approval. The Bank Notes are not subject to redemption at the option of the holders. The Bank Notes are eligible for Tier 2 capital treatment, however, during the last

five years of the instrument, the amount eligible must be reduced by 20 of the original amount annually and that no amount of the instrument is eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 capital when the remaining maturity of the instrument is less than one year. As the Bank Notes are within five years of maturity, only 60 of the notes are eligible for Tier 2 capital treatment at September 30, 2024. 
 In September 2019, Stellar issued 60.0 million aggregate principal amount of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes (the Company Notes due October 1, 2029. The Company Notes bear a fixed interest rate of 4.70 per annum until (but excluding) October 1, 2024, payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1, commencing on April 1, 2020. Thereafter, from October 1, 2024 through the maturity date, October 1, 2029, or earlier redemption date, the Company Notes will bear interest at a floating rate equal to 3-Month SOFR, plus 3.13 , for each quarterly interest period, payable quarterly in arrears on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year. Any redemption will be at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of Company Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, and will be subject to, and require, prior regulatory approval. The Company Notes are not subject to redemption at the option of the holders. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Items 
 In the normal course of business, we enter into various transactions, which, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. We enter into these transactions to meet the financing needs of our customers. These transactions include commitments to extend credit and standby and commercial letters of credit, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in our consolidated balance sheets. 
 Commitments to Extend Credit . We enter into contractual commitments to extend credit, normally with fixed expiration dates or termination clauses, at specified rates and for specific purposes. Substantially all of our commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards at the time of loan funding. We minimize our exposure to loss under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures. The amount and type of collateral obtained, if considered necessary by us, upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer. Management assesses the credit risk associated with certain commitments to extend credit in determining the level of the allowance for credit losses. 
 Standby Letters of Credit. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. If the customer does not perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third party, we would be required to fund the commitment and we would have the rights to the underlying collateral. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount of the commitment. Our policies generally require that standby letter of credit arrangements contain security and debt covenants similar to those contained in loan agreements. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had outstanding 1.70 billion and 1.79 billion, respectively, in commitments to extend credit and 41.8 million and 37.7 million in commitments associated with outstanding letters of credit for those same periods. Since commitments associated with letters of credit and commitments to extend credit may expire unused, the total outstanding may not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity 
 Liquidity is the measure of our ability to meet the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, while at the same time meeting our operating, capital, strategic cash flow needs and to maintain reserve requirements to operate on an ongoing basis and manage unexpected events, all at a reasonable cost. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, our liquidity needs have been primarily met by deposits, borrowed funds and securities. The Bank has access to purchased funds from correspondent banks, the Federal Reserve discount window and advances from the FHLB, on a collateralized basis, are available under a security and pledge agreement to take advantage of investment opportunities. 
 Liquidity risk management is an important element in our asset/liability management process. Our liquidity position is continuously monitored and adjustments are made to the balance between sources and uses of funds as deemed appropriate. We regularly model liquidity stress scenarios to assess potential liquidity outflows or funding problems resulting from economic disruptions, volatility in the financial markets, unexpected credit events or other significant occurrences deemed problematic by management. Liquidity stress scenarios are incorporated into our contingency funding plan, which provides the basis for the identification of our liquidity needs. 
 Our largest source of funds is deposits and our largest use of funds is loans. Average total deposits decreased 20.3 million, or 0.2 , and average loans decreased 167.0 million, or 2.1 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the

Table of Content s 

nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our average deposit account size was 80 thousand at September 30, 2024. We predominantly invest excess deposits in Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas balances, securities, interest-bearing deposits at other banks or other short-term liquid investments until the funds are needed to fund loan growth. Our securities portfolio had a weighted average life of 7.0 years and 7.6 years at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Total immediate contingent funding sources, including unrestricted cash, available-for-sale securities that are not pledged and total available borrowing capacity was 4.33 billion, or 49.6 of total deposits at September 30, 2024. Including policy-driven capacity for brokered deposits, the Bank would have been able to add approximately 1.55 billion to its contingent sources of liquidity, bringing total contingent funding sources to approximately 5.89 billion, or 67.4 , of deposits at September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no exposure to future cash requirements associated with known uncertainties or capital expenditures of a material nature. 
 Capital Resources 
 Capital management consists of providing equity to support our current and future operations. We are subject to capital adequacy requirements imposed by the Federal Reserve and the Bank is subject to capital adequacy requirements imposed by the FDIC. Both the Federal Reserve and the FDIC have adopted risk-based capital requirements for assessing bank holding company and bank capital adequacy. These standards define capital and establish minimum capital requirements in relation to assets and off-balance sheet exposure, adjusted for credit risk. The risk-based capital standards currently in effect are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among bank holding companies and banks, to account for off-balance sheet exposure and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets. Assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories, each with appropriate relative risk weights. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items. 
 Under current guidelines, the minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets (which are primarily the credit risk equivalents of balance sheet assets and certain off-balance sheet items such as standby letters of credit) is 8.0 . At least half of total capital must be composed of Tier 1 capital, which includes common shareholders equity (including retained earnings), less goodwill, other disallowed intangible assets and disallowed deferred tax assets, among other items. The Federal Reserve also has adopted a minimum leverage ratio, requiring Tier 1 capital of at least 4.0 of average quarterly total consolidated assets, net of goodwill and certain other intangible assets, for all but the most highly rated bank holding companies. The federal banking agencies have also established risk-based and leverage capital guidelines that FDIC-insured depository institutions are required to meet. These regulations are generally similar to those established by the Federal Reserve for bank holding companies. 
 Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the federal bank regulatory agencies must take prompt corrective action against undercapitalized U.S. depository institutions. U.S. depository institutions are assigned one of five capital categories: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized, and are subjected to different regulation corresponding to the capital category within which the institution falls. A depository institution is deemed to be well-capitalized if the banking institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0 or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 or greater, a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5 and a leverage ratio of 5.0 or greater, and the institution is not subject to an order, written agreement, capital directive or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific level for any capital measure. Under certain circumstances, a well-capitalized, adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution may be treated as if the institution were in the next lower capital category. 
 Failure to meet capital guidelines could subject the institution to a variety of enforcement remedies by federal bank regulatory agencies, including: termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, restrictions on certain business activities and appointment of the FDIC as conservator or receiver. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank was well-capitalized under regulatory capital guidelines. Total shareholders equity was 1.63 billion at September 30, 2024 compared with 1.52 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of 105.1 million. This increase was primarily due to net income of 89.8 million partially offset by the 0.39 per common share dividend paid for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and a 30.2 million decrease in the accumulated other comprehensive loss, which represents a decrease in the fair value of the Company s securities.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Asset/Liability Management and Interest Rate Risk 
 Our asset liability and interest rate risk policy provides management with the guidelines for effective balance sheet management. We have established a measurement system for monitoring our net interest rate sensitivity position. We manage our sensitivity position within our established guidelines. 
 As a financial institution, a component of the market risk that we face is interest rate volatility. Fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of our assets and liabilities, and the market value of all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, other than those which have a short term to maturity. Interest rate risk is the potential for economic losses due to future interest rate changes. These economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and/or a loss of current fair market values. The objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk while at the same time maximizing income. 
 Based upon the nature of our operations, we are not subject to foreign exchange rate or commodity price risk. We do not own any trading assets. We manage our exposure to interest rates by structuring our balance sheet in the ordinary course of a community banking business. The Company enters into interest rate swaps as an accommodation to customers. 
 Our exposure to interest rate risk is managed by the Asset Liability Committee ALCO ). The ALCO formulates strategies based on appropriate levels of interest rate risk. In determining the appropriate level of interest rate risk, the ALCO considers the impact on earnings and capital of the current outlook on interest rates, potential changes in interest rates, regional economies, liquidity, business strategies and other factors. The ALCO meets regularly to review, among other things, the sensitivity of assets and liabilities to interest rate changes, the book and market values of assets and liabilities, unrealized gains and losses, purchase and sale activities, commitments to originate loans and the maturities of investments and borrowings. Additionally, the ALCO reviews liquidity, cash flow flexibility, maturities of deposits and consumer and commercial deposit activity. 
 We use an interest rate risk simulation model and shock analysis to test the interest rate sensitivity of net interest income and the balance sheet, respectively. All instruments on the balance sheet are modeled at the instrument level, incorporating all relevant attributes such as next reset date, reset frequency and call dates, as well as prepayment assumptions for loans and securities and decay rates for nonmaturity deposits. Assumptions based on past experience are incorporated into the model for nonmaturity deposit account decay rates. The assumptions used are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income. Actual results will differ from the model s simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various management strategies. 
 We utilize static balance sheet rate shocks to estimate the potential impact on net interest income of changes in interest rates under various rate scenarios. This analysis estimates a percentage of change in the metric from the stable rate base scenario versus alternative scenarios of rising and falling market interest rates by instantaneously shocking a static balance sheet. 
 The following table summarizes the simulated change in net interest income over a 12-month horizon and the economic value of equity as of the dates indicated: 
 Change in Interest Rates (Basis Points) Percent Change in Net Interest Income Percent Change in Economic Value of Equity September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 +300 5.9 (0.9) (0.3) (0.9) +200 4.2 (0.6) 1.4 1.8 +100 2.3 0.1 2.0 3.4 Base 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 -100 (2.1) 0.5 (3.5) 1.0 -200 (4.9) 0.2 (9.6) (3.6) 
 These results are primarily due to the size of our cash position, the size and duration of our loan and securities portfolio, the duration of our borrowings and the expected behavior of demand, money market and savings deposits during such rate fluctuations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, changes in our overall interest rate profile were driven by the decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits and certain interest bearing deposits, increases in certificates of deposits and borrowed funds, an increase in loans and decreases in securities and cash and cash equivalents.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management was required to apply judgment in evaluating its controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. See Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 for the Certification statements issued by the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively. 
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting . There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 From time to time, we are subject to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, we are not party to any legal proceedings the resolution of which we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operation, cash flows or capital levels. However, one or more unfavorable outcomes in any claim or litigation against us could have a material adverse effect for the period in which such claim or litigation is resolved. In addition, regardless of their merits or their ultimate outcomes, such matters are costly, divert management s attention and may materially adversely affect our reputation, even if resolved in our favor. We intend to defend ourselves vigorously against any future claims or litigation. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 There have been no material changes in the risk factors previously disclosed by the Company. Investors should carefully consider the risks described in Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Company s Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the Company s other SEC filings. 
 
 ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 During 2024, the Company s Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to provide that the Company may repurchase up to 60 million of the Company s common stock through May 31, 2025. 
 Repurchases under the Company s share repurchase program may be made from time to time at the Company s discretion in open market transactions, through block trades, in privately negotiated transactions, and pursuant to any trading plan that may be adopted by the Company s management in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act or otherwise. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, market conditions, and other corporate liquidity requirements and priorities. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire a specific dollar amount or number of shares and may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time. 
 The number of shares that may be repurchased under the plan was 2,241,477, which was computed based on the closing share price of the Company's common stock, as of September 30, 2024.
