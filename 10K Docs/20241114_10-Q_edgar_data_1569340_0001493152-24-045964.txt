and used cash in operations of approximately
 .
As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a working capital deficiency of approximately 
 and an accumulated deficit of approximately .
As of September 30, 2024 and through the date of this filing, notes payable with principal amounts totaling approximately 
 and ,
respectively, were past due. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern
for at least one year from the date these financial statements are issued. 

The
Company is currently funding its operations on a month-to-month basis. While there can be no assurance that it will be successful,
the Company is in active negotiations to raise additional capital. The Company s primary sources of operating funds since
inception have been equity and debt financings. Management s plans include continued efforts to raise additional capital
through debt and equity financings. There is no assurance that these funds will be sufficient to enable the Company to fully
complete its development activities or attain profitable operations. If the Company is unable to obtain such additional financing on
a timely basis or, notwithstanding any request the Company may make, if the Company s debt holders do not agree to convert
their notes into equity or extend the maturity dates of their notes, the Company may have to curtail its development, marketing and
promotional activities, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results
of operations, and ultimately the Company could be forced to discontinue its operations and liquidate. Subsequent to September 30,
2024 and as more fully described in Note 10, Subsequent Events, the Company received aggregate proceeds of 
from the issuance of common stock and 
from the sale of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. The Company will continue to incur net operating losses to fund
operations. 

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ), which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern
and the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities presented in the financial statements do not necessarily purport to represent realizable or settlement values. The
condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustment that might result from the outcome of this
uncertainty. 

and as of July 1, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
respectively, which included a discount for lack of marketability of . Furthermore, the independent appraisal determined the Company s
expected volatility was and as of July 1, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, by evaluating historical and implied volatilities

such conversion rates are subject to adjustment under certain circumstances, such as stock splits and stock dividends, which may result
in the issuance of common shares greater than the amount indicated. 

In
December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The amendments in this
update address investor requests for more transparency about income tax information through improvements to income tax disclosures primarily
related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. This update also includes certain other amendments to improve the
effectiveness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in ASU 2023-09 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024
with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its condensed consolidated financial
statements. 

In
November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation
Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses. The standard is intended to require more detailed
disclosures about specified categories of expenses (including employee compensation, depreciation, and amortization) included in
certain expense captions presented on the face of the income statement. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2026, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. The
amendments may be applied either (1) prospectively to financial statements issued for reporting periods after the effective date of
this ASU or (2) retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. This ASU is applicable to entities with
a single operating segment. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this
adoption on the condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York. On June 12, 2019, the plaintiff served a motion for summary judgment
through the Secretary of State which was heard on July 12, 2019 and granted. The Company contended that it was not given sufficient notice
under the applicable statute and did not have an opportunity to oppose the motion. Judgment was entered in October 2019 in the amount
of . The Company brought a motion to vacate based on the jurisdictional defect of the motion in not providing the required amount
of time, but that motion was denied in February 2021 without properly addressing the jurisdictional issues raised by the Company. The
Company appealed the denial and then filed a motion to Renew and Reargue the motion to vacate based on the Court s failure to address
critical issues. That motion was also denied on April 15, 2021 without addressing the Company s arguments. The Company appealed
the second denial as well and pursued both appeals in a consolidated manner so as to resolve all issues together. Each of the appeals
was denied. While the Company s motions were pending, the plaintiff commenced steps to collect judgment. During the year ended
December 31, 2021, of a deposit made with the court by a third party on behalf of the Company was released to an officer of
the court and has been accounted for as partial note repayment, with an additional due under the note repaid by a release of
the remaining deposit to an officer of the court and garnishment of Company funds during the year ended December 31, 2022, which was
also accounted for as a note repayment. In August 2023, a supplemental judgment of was entered against the Company. Inasmuch,
as there were no further opportunities to appeal, the Company was required to pay the remaining amount due, which was estimated to be
approximately and recorded as a liability as of December 31, 2023. As of May 31, 2024, after taking into account accrued and
unpaid interest, approximately was owed to the plaintiff and the plaintiff was seeking, among other things, additional monetary
sanctions. In June 2024, the Company resolved this matter by making a final payment of , and the plaintiff agreed to cease the
pursuit of additional sanctions against the Company and has since filed a satisfaction of judgment.

Overview 

We
are a cell therapy company focused on immunotherapy. Since our inception, we have been involved with the development of proprietary immune
system management technology licensed from Yeda Research Development Company Limited Yeda ), the commercial arm of
the Weizmann Institute. We have since shifted the focus of our research and development efforts to MD Anderson. 

This
technology addresses one of the most fundamental challenges within human immunology: how to tune the immune response such that it
tolerates selected desirable foreign cells, but continues to attack all other (undesirable) targets. In simpler terms, a number of
potentially life-saving treatments have limited effectiveness today because the patient s immune system rejects them. For
example, while HSCT hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (e.g. bone marrow transplantation) has become a preferred
therapeutic approach for treating blood cell cancer, most patients do not have a matched family donor. Although matched unrelated
donors and cord blood can each provide an option for such patients, haploidentical stem cell transplants (sourced from partially
mismatched family members) are rapidly gaining favor as a treatment of choice. This is still a risky and difficult procedure
primarily because of potential conflicts between host (recipient) and donor immune systems and also due to viral infections that
often follow even successful HSCT while the compromised new immune system works to reconstitute itself by using the transplanted
stem cells. Today, rejection is partially overcome using aggressive immune suppression treatments that leave the patient exposed to
many dangers by compromising their immune system. 

The
unique advantage of Cell Source technology lies in the ability to induce sustained tolerance of transplanted cells (or organs) by the
recipient s immune system in a setting that requires only mild immune suppression, while avoiding the most common post-transplant
complications. The scientific term for the result of successfully inducing such tolerance in a transplantation setting is chimerism,
where the recipient s immune system tolerates the co-existence of the (genetically different) donor type and host type cells. Attaining
sustained chimerism is an important prerequisite to achieving the intrinsic GvL (graft versus leukemia) effect of HSCT and supporting
the reconstitution of normal hematopoiesis (generation of blood cells, including those that protect healthy patients from cancer) in
blood cancer patients. Preclinical data and initial clinical data show that Cell Source s Veto Cell technology can provide superior
results in allogeneic (donor-derived) HSCT by allowing for haploidentical stem cell transplants under a mild conditioning regimen, while
avoiding the most common post-transplant complications. Combining this with CAR (Chimeric Antigen Receptor) T cell therapy as a unified
VETO CAR-T treatment, we will be able to treat patients in relapse as well as those in remission and use the cancer killing power of
CAR-T to protect the patient while their immune system fully reconstitutes, thus providing an end-to-end solution for blood cancer treatment
by potentially delivering a fundamentally safer and more effective allogeneic HSCT: prevention of relapse; avoidance GvHD; prevention
of viral infections; and enhanced persistence of GvL effect. This means that the majority of patients will be able to find a donor, and
will have access to a potentially safer procedure with higher long term survival rates than what either donor-derived HSCT or autologous
CAR-T each on their own currently provide. 

The
ability to induce permanent chimerism (and thus sustained tolerance) in patients which allows the transplantation to overcome
rejection without having to compromise the rest of the immune system may open the door to effective treatment of a number of
severe medical conditions, in addition to blood cancers, which are characterized by this need. These include: 

The
 broader set of cancers, including solid tumors, that can potentially be treated effectively using genetically modified cells such
 as CAR-T cell therapy, but also face efficacy and economic constraints due to limited persistence based on immune system issues (i.e.,
 the need to be able to safely and efficiently deliver allogeneic CAR-T therapy). Inducing sustained tolerance to CAR-T cells may
 bring reduced cost and increased efficacy by allowing for off-the-shelf (vs. patient-derived) treatments with more persistent cancer
 killing capability. 

Organ
 failure and transplantation. A variety of conditions can be treated by the transplantation of vital organs. However, transplantation
 is limited both by the insufficient supply of available donor organs and the need for lifelong, daily anti-rejection treatments post-transplant.
 Haploidentical organ transplants, with sustained chimerism, have the potential to make life saving transplants accessible to the
 majority of patients, with the prospect of improved life quality and expectancy. 

Non-malignant
 hematological conditions (such as type one diabetes and sickle cell anemia) which could, in many cases, also be more effectively
 treated by stem cell transplantation if the procedure could be made safer and more accessible by inducing sustained tolerance in
 the stem cell transplant recipient.

Recent
Developments 

Preclinical
Results and Clinical Results 

After two years of intensive
collaboration with Professor Zelig Eshhar, the inventor of CAR-T cell therapy, preclinical data confirmed that Veto Cells can markedly
extend persistence of genetically modified T cells from the same donor and that genetically modified Veto Cells can effectively inhibit
tumors expressing an antigen recognized by the transgenic T cell receptor. Furthermore, human Veto Cells transfected with CAR exhibit
anti-tumor activity in-vitro without losing their veto activity. These preclinical results have formed the basis of our current development
of a clinical protocol for allogeneic VETO CAR-T HSCT combined therapy for blood cancer treatment. Cell Source plans to submit this protocol
for approval in 2025. Recent preclinical research has determined that Veto Cells can overcome rejection from both NK (natural killer)
cells and T-cells, further enhancing their potential efficacy when used for off-the-shelf CAR-T cell therapy. The Phase 1/2 clinical trial
at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, using Cell Source s
Anti-viral Veto Cells, has completed the first five treatment cohorts, with 15 patients each receiving a haploidentical HSCT under reduced
intensity conditioning with Veto Cells. This trial has thus far shown that there has been no toxicity associated with the Veto Cells,
with patients showing successful stem cell engraftment, in the absence of severe GvHD. The study is expected to continue
with additional cohorts of patients, using the current treatment protocol.

This decrease is primarily attributable to decreases in legal expenses of approximately 16,000, due to various legal matters that occurred
in 2023, stock-based compensation expense of 20,000 and consulting expenses of 60,000, due to a decrease in various consulting services,
partially offset by increases in accounting and audit expenses of approximately 57,000, due to increased work performed, and payroll
expenses of 30,000. 

Interest
Expense 

Interest
expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 356,786 and 262,091, respectively, an increase of 94,695, or 36 .
This increase is primarily associated with an increase in the balance of interest bearing notes during the 2024 compared to the prior
period. 

Interest
Expense - Amortization of Debt Discount 

Amortization
of debt discount was 148,073 and 80,667 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 67,406,
or 84 . This increase is primarily associated with an increase in notes payable issued in 2024 compared to the prior year. 

Change
in Fair Value of Derivative Liabilities 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a gain on the change in fair value of derivative liability of 98,550. 

Gain
on Extinguishment of Note Payable 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a gain on the extinguishment of a note payable of 17,893 via the issuance of
warrants. The gain on extinguishment of note payable is attributable to the exchange of a promissory note in the principal
amount of 30,000 for a five-year warrant to purchase 100,000 shares of common stock. 

Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with the Nine Months Ended September, 2023

of 318,488, or 26 . This increase is primarily attributable to a patient enrollment milestone being achieved during the 2024 period,
compared to no patient enrollment milestones being achieved during the 2023 period. 

General
and Administrative 

General
and administrative expense, which is associated with external consulting and professional fees, payroll and stock-based compensation
expenses, was 1,626,352 and 2,097,801 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of 471,449,
or 22 . This decrease is primarily attributable to decreases in legal expenses of 367,000, due to various legal matters that occurred
in 2023, stock-based compensation expense of 100,000 and consulting expenses of 150,000, due to a decrease in various consulting services,
partially offset by an increase in external expenses of 84,000 and payroll expense of 72,000.

Interest
expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 730,539 and 635,143, respectively, an increase of 95,396, or 15 .

to the prior period.

of debt discount was 223,652 and 361,692 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of 138,040,
or 38 . This decrease is primarily associated with a majority of the debt discount being fully amortized during 2023.

during the 2023 period as compared to a 30,000 note during the 2024 period. 

Liquidity
and Going Concern 

We
measure our liquidity in a number of ways, including the following: 

September
 30,2024 
 December
 31, 2023 

Cash 
 22,992 
 22,203 
 
 Working
 capital deficiency 
 (18,940,556 
 (15,611,543 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had not generated any revenues, had a net loss of approximately 4,181,000 and had used
cash in operations of approximately 1,936,000. As of September 30, 2024, we had a working capital deficiency of approximately 18,941,000
and an accumulated deficit of approximately 45,849,000. As of September 30, 2024 and through the date of this filing, notes payable
with principal amounts totaling 5,663,000 and 1,926,093, respectively, were past due. We will continue to incur net operating losses
to fund operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from
the date these financial statements are issued. 

We
are currently funding our operations on a month-to-month basis. While there can be no assurance that we will be successful, we are in
active negotiations to raise additional capital. Our primary sources of operating funds since inception have been equity and debt financings.
Management s plans include continued efforts to raise additional capital through debt and equity financings. There is no assurance
that these funds will be sufficient to enable us to fully complete our development activities or attain profitable operations. If we
are unable to obtain such additional financing on a timely basis or, notwithstanding any request we may make, if our debt holders do
not agree to convert their notes into equity or extend the maturity dates of their notes, we may have to curtail our development, marketing
and promotional activities, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations,
and ultimately we could be forced to discontinue our operations and liquidate. Subsequent to September 30, 2024 and as more fully described in Note 10, Subsequent Events , the Company received
aggregate proceeds of 75,000 from the issuance of common stock and 300,000 from the sale of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. The
Company will continue to incur net operating losses to fund operations 

There
can be no assurances that we will be successful in generating additional cash from equity or debt financings or other sources to be used
for operations. Should we not be successful in obtaining the necessary financing to fund our operations, we would need to curtail certain
or all operational activities and/or contemplate the sale of our assets, if necessary. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our sources and uses of cash were as follows: 

Net
Cash Used in Operating Activities 

We
experienced negative cash flows from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 in the amounts of approximately
 1,936,000 and 1,626,000, respectively. The net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily
due to cash used to fund a net loss of approximately 4,181,000, adjusted for net non-cash expenses in the aggregate amount of approximately
 670,000, partially offset by 1,575,000 of net cash provided by changes in the levels of operating assets and liabilities. The net cash
used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to cash used to fund a net loss of approximately
 4,271,000, adjusted for non-cash expenses in the aggregate amount of approximately 753,000, partially offset by 1,892,000 of net cash
provided by changes in the levels of operating assets and liabilities. 

Net
Cash Provided by Financing Activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 1,937,000 and 1,406,000,
respectively. The net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was attributable to 416,000
of proceeds from issuance of common stock and warrants, 776,000 of proceeds from the issuance of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock
and warrants, approximately 647,000 of proceeds from the issuance of notes and convertible notes payable, proceeds from advances payable
and a related party advance of 159,000 partially offset by the repayment of a financing liability in the amount of 49,000 and 13,000
related to the repayment of notes payable. The net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023
was attributable to 677,000 of proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes to a related party director and 920,000 of proceeds
from the issuance of convertible notes payable, partially offset by 191,000 of repayments towards the financing of the Company s
Director s and Officer s Insurance.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements and related disclosures are in conformity with U.S. GAAP. These accounting principles require us
to make estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements,
as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the periods presented. We believe that the estimates and judgments upon
which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that we make these estimates and judgments. To the extent
that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial results will be affected. The accounting
policies that reflect our more significant estimates and judgments and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding
and evaluating our reported financial results are described below. 

We
consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (i) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were
highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (ii) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from
period to period or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact
on our financial condition or results of operations. 

There
have been no material changes to the Company s critical accounting estimates since the 2023 Form 10-K except as described below. 

Valuation
of the Company s Common Stock Price 

Because
the Company s common stock historically was not actively traded on a public market, the fair value of the Company s restricted
equity instruments is estimated by management based on observations of the sales prices of both restricted and freely tradable common
stock, or instruments convertible into common stock. The Company obtained a third-party valuation of its common stock as of July 1, 2024
and December 31, 2023, which was considered in management s estimation of fair value during the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024. The third-party valuation was performed in accordance with regulation of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code IRC as well as FASB ASC Topic 718. 

The
independent appraisal utilized the market approach, specifically the Backsolve method. The Backsolve method utilizes the economics from
a direct transaction in the Company s securities in determining fair value. The Backsolve method utilizes the Black-Scholes option
pricing method OPM which allocated a probability-weighted present value to the Company s convertible securities.
The following steps were applied under the OPM: 

Establishment
 of total enterprise or equity value; 

Analysis
 of equity rights for each class of security; 

Selection
 of appropriate model for valuation purposes; 

Determination
 of key valuation inputs; and 

Computation
 of the fair value of the subject security. 

Under
the OPM, it was determined the Company s common stock had a fair value of 0.28 and 0.26 as of July 1, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
respectively, which included a discount for lack of marketability of 25 . Furthermore, the independent appraisal determined the Company s
expected volatility was 75 and 65 as of July 1, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, by evaluating historical and implied volatilities
of guideline companies. 

Item
3. Quantitative And Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls are procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed
under the Exchange Act, such as this Annual Report, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including the Principal Executive and Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. Internal controls are procedures which are designed with the objective of providing reasonable assurance
that (1) our transactions are properly authorized, recorded and reported; and (2) our assets are safeguarded against unauthorized or
improper use, to permit the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with United States generally
accepted accounting principles. 

In
connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report, management, with the participation of our Principal Executive and Financial
Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange
Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Based upon that evaluation, our Principal Executive and Financial Officer concluded that, as of September
30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings. 

We are not currently involved in any pending legal proceeding or litigations and, to the best of our knowledge, no

stock to four (4) accredited investors at a purchase price of 0.317 per share. In connection with this transaction, we issued the investors
ten-year warrants to purchase 1,312,500 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 0.35 per share. We relied upon the exemption
provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), in connection with these issuances. 

In July 2024, we issued we issued five-year warrants
to purchase a total of 37,500 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 0.75 per share to holders of promissory notes in exchange
for their agreement to extend the maturity dates and amend certain other terms of the notes. We relied upon the exemption provided by
Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act in connection with these transactions. 

In July 2024, we issued a warrant to purchase 100,000 shares of our
common stock at an exercise price of 0.35 per share to a holder of a promissory note in the principal amount of 30,000 in exchange
for the cancellation of the promissory note. We relied upon the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act in connection
with this transaction.

as of September 30, 2024. Of such past due notes payable, a holder of a note with principal amount of 250,000 issued a notice of default.
See Item 1 above for additional details. We are in negotiations with all holders to extend the maturity dates of such notes or to convert
the principal and accrued interest into equity.
