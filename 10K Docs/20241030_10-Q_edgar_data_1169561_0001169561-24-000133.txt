 . Developed technology purchased in fiscal 2022 was valued using the replacement cost method and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over its economic life of . We believe this method most closely reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets will be consumed. Impairment losses are recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is both not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. 
 , the expected period of benefit of the asset capitalized. We currently estimate a period of is appropriate based on consideration of historical average customer life and the estimated useful life of the underlying software sold as part of the transaction. The commission paid on the renewal of subscription arrangements is not commensurate with the commission paid on the initial purchase. As a result, the cost of commissions allocated to SaaS offerings, software updates and customer support on the initial term-based software license transactions are amortized over a period of approximately , consistent with the accounting for these costs associated with perpetual licenses. The costs of commissions allocated to SaaS offerings, software updates and customer support for the renewal of term-based software licenses is limited to the contractual period of the arrangement, as we pay a commensurate renewal commission upon the next renewal of the subscription software license and related updates and support. 
 
 The incremental costs attributable to professional services are generally amortized over the period the related services are provided and revenue is recognized. Amortization expense related to these costs is included in sales and marketing expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

 but can range between one and . For SaaS offerings, revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term beginning on the date that the service is made available to the customer. 
 Perpetual License 
 Perpetual license includes the revenues from the sale of perpetual software licenses. Perpetual software license revenue is typically recognized when the software is delivered or made available for download. 
 Customer Support 
 Customer support includes revenues associated with support contracts tied to our software products. Customer support includes software updates on a when-and-if-available basis, telephone support, integrated web-based support, and other premium support offerings, for both subscription software and perpetual software license arrangements. We sell our customer support contracts as a percentage of net software purchases. Customer support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the customer support agreement, which is typically on our perpetual licenses and over the term on our term-based licenses. 
 Other Services 
 Other services consist primarily of revenues related to professional service offerings, including consultation, assessment and design, installation services, and customer education. Revenues related to other services can vary period over period based on the timing services are delivered and are typically recognized as the services are performed. 
 We do not customize our software licenses (both perpetual and term-based) and installation services are not required. Software licenses are delivered before related services are provided and are functional without professional services, updates, or technical support. We have concluded that our software licenses (both perpetual and term-based) are functional intellectual property that is distinct, as the user can benefit from the software on its own. Revenues for both perpetual and term-based licenses are typically recognized when the software is delivered and/or made available for download as this is the point the user of the software can direct the use of and obtain substantially all the remaining benefits from the functional intellectual property. We do not recognize software revenue related to the renewal of subscription software licenses earlier than the beginning of the new subscription period. 
 We also offer appliances that integrate our software with hardware and address a wide range of business needs and use cases, ranging from support for remote or branch offices with limited IT staff up to large corporate data centers. Our appliances are almost exclusively sold via a software only model in which we sell software to a third party, which assembles an integrated appliance that is sold to end user customers. As a result, the revenues and costs associated with hardware are usually not included in our financial statements.

 Judgments related to revenue recognition 
 Most of our contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, we evaluate and account for individual performance obligations separately if they are determined to be distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. Standalone selling prices of software licenses (both perpetual and term-based) are typically estimated using the residual approach. Standalone selling prices for SaaS, customer support contracts, and other services are typically estimated based on observable transactions when these services are sold on a standalone basis. We recognize revenue net of sales tax. 
 
 Disaggregation of Revenues 
 
 We disaggregate revenues from contracts with customers into geographical regions. Our Americas region includes the United States, Canada, and Latin America. Our International region primarily includes Europe, Middle East, Africa, Australia, India, Southeast Asia, and China.

 Remaining performance obligations, excluding deferred revenue, related to subscription arrangements, customer support revenue and other services were , , and , respectively. Of these balances, we expect approximately of subscription arrangements, of customer support and of other services to be recognized as revenue over the next months and the remainder recognized thereafter. We expect approximately of subscription arrangements and of customer support remaining performance obligations to be recognized as revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2025. These balances represent transactions consisting primarily of early renewals, unbilled and undelivered support and other services, and orders received prior to the last day of the quarter that were not delivered or provisioned to customers. 
 
 Remaining performance obligations will fluctuate period to period. We do not believe the amount of remaining performance obligations is indicative of future sales or revenue or that the mix at the end of any given period correlates with actual sales performance. 

Information about Contract Balances 

Increase/(decrease) ) ) Ending balance as of September 30, 2024 

The net decrease in accounts receivable (inclusive of unbilled receivables) is primarily the result of the timing of our billings and cash collections. The net increase in deferred revenue is primarily the result of an increase in SaaS contracts which are billed upfront but recognized ratably over the contract period, partially offset by a decrease in professional service contracts. 
 
 and for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The vast majority of this revenue consists of SaaS arrangements and customer support. The amount of revenue recognized from performance obligations satisfied in prior periods was not significant.

These stock units were valued based on the volume weighted average price of our share price for the thirty days preceding the close date. As a result, unregistered restricted stock units were issued at a fair value of per share. The primary reason for the business combination is to extend and enhance our product and service offerings in the cyber resiliency market.

 Contingent Consideration 
 The contingent consideration arrangement requires us to pay up to in cash to the former owner of Appranix, contingent upon the achievement of certain financial metrics measured on December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025. The actual consideration can range from to . The fair value of the contingent liability was estimated to be using a Monte Carlo simulation model and is included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. At the end of each reporting period after the acquisition date, the arrangement is remeasured at its fair value, with changes in fair value recorded through the consolidated statements of operations as general and administrative expenses. As of September 30, 2024, we continue to estimate the fair value of the liability at .

The decrease in income tax expense compared to the prior year period relates primarily to the recognition of deferred tax assets that were not recognized in prior years due to the Company s valuation allowance, as well as windfalls from stock compensation.

 senior secured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The Credit Facility is available for share repurchases, general corporate purposes, and letters of credit. The Credit Facility contains financial maintenance covenants, including a leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio. The Credit Facility also contains certain customary events of default which would permit the lender to, among other things, declare all loans then outstanding to be immediately due and payable if such default is not cured within applicable grace periods. The Credit Facility also limits our ability to incur certain additional indebtedness, create or permit liens on assets, make acquisitions, make investments, engage in loans or advances, sell or transfer assets, pay dividends or distributions, and engage in certain transactions with foreign affiliates. Outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility accrue interest at an annual rate equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus subject to increases based on our actual leverage. The unused balance on the Credit Facility is also subject to a annual interest charge subject to increases based on our actual leverage. As of September 30, 2024, there were borrowings under the Credit Facility and we were in compliance with all covenants.

As the transaction closed subsequent to the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we are still evaluating the purchase price allocation of the transaction, but we expect the primary assets acquired to be intangible assets and goodwill. Acquired tangible assets and assumed liabilities are expected to be immaterial. The allocation is expected to be finalized during the second half of fiscal 2025.

 Item 2 - Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 You should read the following discussion and analysis along with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The statements in this discussion regarding our expectations of our future performance, liquidity and capital resources, and other non-historical statements are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described under Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. 
 
 Overview 
 Incorporated in Delaware in 1996, Commvault Systems, Inc. provides its customers with a scalable platform that enhances customers' cyber resiliency by protecting their data in a world of increasing threats. We provide these products and services for their data across many types of environments, including on-premises, hybrid and multi-cloud. Our offerings are delivered via self-managed software, software-as-a-service ("SaaS"), integrated appliances, or managed by partners. Customers use our Commvault Cloud platform to protect themselves from threats like ransomware and recover their data efficiently. 
 Sources of Revenues 
 We generate revenues through subscription arrangements, perpetual software licenses, customer support contracts and other services. A significant portion of our total revenues comes from subscription arrangements, which include both sales of term-based licenses and SaaS offerings. We are focused on these types of recurring revenue arrangements. 
 We expect our subscription arrangements will continue to generate revenues from the renewals of term-based licenses and SaaS offerings sold in prior years. Any of our pricing models (capacity, instance based, etc.) can be sold via a subscription arrangement, either through term-based licensing or hosted services. In term-based license arrangements, the customer has the right to use the software over a designated period of time. The capacity of the license is fixed and the customer has made an unconditional commitment to pay. Software revenue in these arrangements is generally recognized when the software is delivered. In SaaS offerings, customers use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software. Revenue related to SaaS is recognized ratably over the contract period. 
 We sell to end-user customers both directly through our sales force and indirectly through our global network of value-added reseller partners, systems integrators, corporate resellers, original equipment manufacturers, and marketplaces. Subscription revenue generated through indirect distribution channels accounted for approximately 90 of total subscription revenue in both the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Subscription revenue generated through direct distribution channels accounted for approximately 10 of total subscription revenue in both the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Deals initiated by our direct sales force are sometimes transacted through indirect channels based on end-user customer requirements, which are not always in our control and can cause this overall percentage split to vary from period-to-period. As such, there may be fluctuations in the dollars and percentage of subscription revenue generated through our direct distribution channels from time-to-time. We believe that the growth of our subscription revenue, derived from both our indirect channel partners and direct sales force, are key attributes to our long-term growth strategy. We intend to continue to invest in both our channel relationships and direct sales force in the future, but we continue to expect more revenue to be generated through indirect distribution channels over the long term. The failure of our indirect distribution channels or our direct sales force to effectively sell our products and services could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. 
 We have a non-exclusive distribution agreement with Arrow pursuant to which Arrow's primary role is to enable a more efficient and effective distribution channel for our solutions by managing our resellers and leveraging their own industry experience. We generated 36 of our total revenues through Arrow for both the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. If Arrow were to discontinue or reduce the sales of our solutions or if our agreement with Arrow were terminated, and if we were unable to take back the management of our reseller channel or find another distributor to replace Arrow, there could be a material adverse effect on our future business. 
 Our c ustomer support revenue includes support contracts tied to our software products. Customer support includes software updates on a when-and-if-available basis, telephone support, integrated web-based support, and other premium support offerings, for both term-based software license and perpetual software license

 arrangements. We sell our customer support contracts as a percentage of net software. Customer support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the customer support agreement, which is typically one year on our perpetual licenses. The term of our subscription arrangements is typically one to three years but can range between one and five years. 
 Our other services revenue consists primarily of professional service offerings, including consultation, assessment and design, installation services, and customer education. Revenues from other services can vary period over period based on the timing services are delivered and are typically recognized as the services are performed. 
 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rates Impact on Results of Operations 
 Sales outside the United States were 46 of our total revenues for both the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The income statements of our non-U.S. operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates for each applicable month in a period. To the extent the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions generally results in increased revenues, operating expenses and income from operations for our non-U.S. operations. Similarly, our revenues, operating expenses and net income will generally decrease for our non-U.S. operations if the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies. 
 Using the average foreign currency exchange rates from the three months ended September 30, 2023, our total revenues would have been lower by 1.8 million, our cost of revenues would have been lower by 0.1 million and our operating expenses would have been lower by 1.0 million from non-U.S. operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Using the average foreign currency exchange rates from the six months ended September 30, 2023, our total revenues would have been lower by 0.6 million, our cost of revenues would have been higher by less than 0.1 million and our operating expenses would have been lower by 0.7 million from non-U.S. operations for the six months ended September 30, 2024. 
 In addition, we are exposed to risks of foreign currency fluctuation primarily from cash balances, accounts receivables and intercompany accounts denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to the resulting transaction gains and losses, which are recorded as a component of general and administrative expenses. We recognized net foreign currency transaction losses of approximately 0.3 million for both the three and six months ended September 30, 2024. We recognized net foreign currency transaction losses of approximately 0.1 million and 0.2 million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 In presenting our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported therein. Some of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events. We base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable and appropriate. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be affected. 
 In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by U.S. GAAP and does not require management s judgment in its application, while in other cases, significant judgment is required in selecting among available alternative accounting standards that allow different accounting treatment for similar transactions. We consider these policies requiring significant management judgment to be critical accounting policies. These critical accounting policies are: 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Accounting for Income Taxes 
 Goodwill 
 There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies during the six months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024.

 Revenues in millions) 

Total revenues increased 32.3 million, or 16 year over year, driven prim arily by an increase in subscription revenue, partially offset by decreases in perpetual license and other services revenues. We remain focused on selling subscription arrangements through both term-based software licenses and SaaS offerings. 
 Subscription revenue increased 36.3 million, or 37 year over year, driven primarily by a 75 increase in our SaaS revenue. Term-based license revenue increased 22 , primarily due to an increase in the number of larger term-based license transactions (deals greater than 0.1 million) period over period and an increase in the average selling price of these transactions. Subscription revenue accounted for 57 of total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 49 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Perpetual license revenue decreased 3.9 million, or 27 year over year. Our preferred route to market is led by the sale of term-based licenses. Perpetual licenses are generally only sold in certain verticals and geographies. Perpetual license revenue accounted for 5 of total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 7 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Customer support revenue increased 0.7 million, or 1 year over year, driven by a 6.8 million increase in customer support revenue related to term-based license arrangements, partially offset by a 6.1 million decrease in support attached to perpetual license support renewals. 
 Other services revenue decreased 0.8 million, or 7 year over year. Changes in other services revenue can vary period over period, primarily due to the timing professional services are delivered.

 We track total revenues on a geographic basis. Our Americas region includes the United States, Canada, and Latin America. Our International region primarily includes Europe, Middle East, Africa, Australia, India, Southeast Asia and China. Americas and International represented 62 and 38 of total revenues, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Total revenues increased 20 and 10 year over year in the Americas and International, respectively. 
 The increase in Americas total revenues was primarily due to an increase of 40 in subscription revenues, offset by decreases of 11 , 1 and 9 in perpetual license, customer support and other services revenues, respectively, as compared to the same period of the prior year. 
 The increase in International total revenues was primarily due to increases of 32 and 3 in subscription and customer support revenues, respectively, offset by decreases of 34 and 2 in perpetual license and other services revenues, respectively, as compared to the same period of the prior year.

 Operating Expenses in millions) 

Sales and marketing expenses increased 17.2 million, or 20 , driven by a 14.1 million increase in employee compensation and sales commissions associated with increased revenues relative to the same period in the prior year, including an increase of 1.7 million in stock-based compensation. 
 Research and development expenses increased 2.6 million, or 8 , driven by increases in employee compensation and related expenses, including an increase of 0.2 million in stock-based compensation. The increase in employee compensation and related expenses is primarily driven by additional headcount, including the headcount related to the Appranix, Inc. ("Appranix") acquisition completed in April 2024. Investing in research and development remains a priority for Commvault and we anticipate continued responsible spending related to the development of our software applications and hosted services. 
 General and administrative expenses increased 6.2 million, or 22 , primarily due to increases in accounting and legal expenses related to the acquisitions of Appranix and Clumio, Inc. ("Clumio"), and increases in employee compensation and related expenses, including an increase of 1.0 million in stock-based compensation year over year. 
 Restructuring: Our restructuring plan, initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, is intended to enhance customer satisfaction through the reorganization and redesign of our customer success functions. The realignment of the customer success structure aims to optimize operational efficiency and improve continuity for our customers through the pre-sales and post-sales experience. Restructuring expenses were 0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. These charges relate primarily to severance and related costs associated with headcount reductions. These expenses included 0.2 million of stock-based compensation related to modifications of existing awards granted to certain employees impacted by the plan. We anticipate the restructuring plan will be completed in the second half of fiscal 2025. There were no restructuring expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Risks associated with our restructuring plan include additional unexpected costs, adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational and growth targets due to the loss of key employees, any of which may impair our ability to achieve anticipated results of operations or otherwise harm our business. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased 0.5 million, driven by the acquisition of intangible assets in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.

 Interest Income 
 Interest income increased 0.4 million, from 1.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 1.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily as a result of the amount of invested funds subject to interest income. 
 
 Income Tax Expense 
 Income tax expense was 1.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to expense of 5.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in income tax expense compared to the same period in the prior year relates primarily to the recognition of deferred tax assets that were not recognized in prior years due to the Company s valuation allowance, as well as windfalls from stock compensation.

Sales and marketing expenses increased 29.1 million, or 17 , primarily due to a 20.2 million increase in employee compensation and sales commissions associated with increased revenues relative to the same period in the prior year, including an increase of 1.5 million in stock-based compensation. In addition, there was an increase year over year in expenses related to a live sales kickoff event and participation in certain strategic conferences, including the RSA conference during the period. These events did not occur in the same period in the prior year. 
 Research and development expenses increased 4.3 million, or 7 , driven by increases in employee compensation and related expenses resulting from additional headcount related to the Appranix acquisition completed in April 2024.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 In recent fiscal years, our principal source of liquidity has been cash provided by operations. As of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents balance was 303.1 million, of which approximately 198.8 million was held outside of the United States by our foreign legal entities. These balances are dispersed across approximately 35 international locations around the world. We believe that such dispersion meets the current and anticipated future liquidity needs of our foreign legal entities. In the event we need to repatriate funds from outside of the United States, such repatriation would likely be subject to restrictions by local laws and/or tax consequences, including foreign withholding taxes. 
 On December 13, 2021, we entered into a five-year 100 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The Credit Facility is available for share repurchases, general corporate purposes, and letters of credit. The Credit Facility contains financial maintenance covenants, including a leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio. The Credit Facility also contains certain customary events of default which would permit the lender to, among other things, declare all loans then outstanding to be immediately due and payable if such default is not cured within applicable grace periods. The Credit Facility also limits our ability to incur certain additional indebtedness, create or permit liens on assets, make acquisitions, make investments, engage in loans or advances, sell or transfer assets, pay dividends or distributions, and engage in certain transactions with foreign affiliates. Outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility accrue interest at an annual rate equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 1.25 subject to increases based on our actual leverage. The unused balance on the Credit Facility is also subject to a 0.25 annual interest charge subject to increases based on our actual leverage. As of September 30, 2024, there were no borrowings under the Credit Facility and we were in compliance with all covenants. 
 On April 18, 2024, the Board of Directors approved an increase of the existing share repurchase program so that 250.0 million was available. The Board's authorization has no expiration date. For the six months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 103.3 million of our common stock. The remaining amount available under the current authorization as of September 30, 2024 was 153.2 million. 
 Our summarized cash flow information is as follows (in millions): 
 Six Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 100.3 79.4 Net cash used in investing activities (24.3) (2.0) Net cash used in financing activities (92.2) (76.0) Effects of exchange rate - changes in cash 6.5 (5.9) Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents (9.7) (4.5) 
 35 

Table of Contents 

Net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by net income adjusted for the impact of non-cash charges and a decrease in accounts receivable, partially offset by an increase in deferred commissions costs. 
 Net cash used in investing activities was related to 21.0 million for the acquisition of Appranix, 2.7 million of capital expenditures and 0.6 million for the purchase of equity securities. 
 Net cash used in financing activities was the result of 103.3 million of repurchases of common shares, partially offset by 11.1 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. 
 Working capital decreased 15.6 million from 110.2 million as of March 31, 2024 to 94.6 million as of September 30, 2024. The net decrease in working capital was primarily driven by a decrease in accounts receivable, partially offset by decreases in accrued liabilities and the current portion of deferred revenue. 
 We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and our cash from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital, income taxes, capital expenditures and potential stock repurchases for at least the next twelve months. We may seek additional funding through public or private financings or other arrangements during this period. Adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities, dilution to existing stockholders will result. If we raise additional funds by obtaining loans from third parties, the terms of those financing arrangements may include negative covenants or other restrictions on our business that could impair our operational flexibility and would also require us to fund additional interest expense. If funding is insufficient at any time in the future, we may be unable to develop or enhance our products or services, take advantage of business opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we did not have off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities.

 Economic Exposure 
 As a global company, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Our international sales are generally denominated in foreign currencies and this revenue could be materially affected by currency fluctuations. Approximately 46 of our sales were outside the United States for the six months ended September 30, 2024. Our primary exposures are to fluctuations in exchange rates for the U.S. dollar versus the Euro, and to a lesser extent, the Australian dollar, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, Indian rupee, Korean won and Singapore dollar. Changes in currency exchange rates could adversely affect our reported revenues and require us to reduce our prices to remain competitive in foreign markets, which could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Historically, we have periodically reviewed and revised the pricing of our products available to our customers in foreign countries and we have not maintained excess cash balances in foreign accounts. 
 Transaction Exposure 
 Our exposure to foreign currency transaction gains and losses is primarily the result of certain net receivables due from our foreign subsidiaries and customers being denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary. Our foreign subsidiaries conduct their businesses in local currency and we generally do not maintain excess U.S. dollar cash balances in foreign accounts. 
 Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. We recognized net foreign currency transaction losses of approximately 0.3 million for both the three and six months ended September 30, 2024. We recognized net foreign currency transaction losses of approximately 0.1 million and 0.2 million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 

Item 4 - Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2025 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations on Internal Controls 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, we are subject to claims in legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business. We do not believe that we are currently party to any pending legal action that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results. Please refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024 for additional information. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024, which are incorporated herein by reference, and could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial conditions or results of operations could be negatively affected. In that case, the trading price of our stock could decline, and our stockholders may lose part or all of their investment. There have been no material changes from the risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024.
