classes of common ownership interests in Carvana Group, Class A common units (the "Class A Units") and Class B common units (the "Class B Units"). As further discussed in Note 10 Stockholders' Equity (Deficit), the Class A Units and Class B Units (collectively, the "LLC Units") do not hold voting rights, which results in Carvana Group being considered a variable interest entity ("VIE").

As of September 30, 2024, Carvana Co. owned approximately of Carvana Group and the LLC Unitholders (as defined in Note 10 Stockholders' Equity (Deficit)) owned the remaining .

Liquidity 
 
 The Company has incurred losses in prior periods and may incur additional losses in the future as it continues to focus on driving profitability through operating efficiency. Historically, the Company's capital and liquidity needs have been primarily satisfied through its debt and equity financings, operating cash flows, and short-term revolving facilities. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased and cancelled an additional million of principal amount of 2028 Senior Secured Notes (as defined below) and extended one of its short-term revolving credit facilities through August 2025. Management believes that current working capital, cash flows from operations, and expected continued or new financing arrangements will be sufficient to fund operations for at least one year from the financial statement issuance date.

 On January 5, 2022, in recognition of the Company selling its 1 millionth vehicle in the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company's CEO, Ernest Garcia III ("Mr. Garcia"), committed to giving then-current employees shares of Class A common stock each from his personal shareholdings once employees reach their employment anniversary ("CEO Milestone Gift" or "Gift").

For every Gift that vested, and pursuant to a contribution agreement (the "Contribution Agreement") entered into by and between the Company and Mr. Garcia on February 22, 2022, Mr. Garcia contributed to the Company, at the end of each fiscal quarter, the number of shares of Class A common stock, granted pursuant to the CEO Milestone Gift, that had vested during such quarter.

 As discussed in Note 8 Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities, the Company has retained certain beneficial interests in securitizations pursuant to the Company s obligations as a sponsor under the Risk Retention Rules.

The securitization trusts distribute payments related to the Company's pledged beneficial interests in securitizations directly to the lenders, which reduces the beneficial interests in securitizations and the related debt balance. Pledged collateral levels are monitored daily and are generally maintained at an agreed-upon percentage of the fair value of the amounts borrowed during the life of the transactions. In the event of a decline in the fair value of the pledged collateral, the repurchase price of the pledged collateral will be increased by the amount of the decline.

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized less than million of equity-based compensation expense related to the ESPP in each period. 
 
 Class A Units 
 
 During 2018, the Company granted certain employees Class A Units with service-based vesting over two - to periods and a grant-date fair value of per Class A Unit. The grantees entered into the Exchange Agreement under which each LLC Unitholder (and certain permitted transferees thereof) may receive shares of the Company's Class A common stock in exchange for their LLC Units on a four-to-five conversion ratio, or cash at the option of the Company, subject to conversion ratio adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends, reclassifications, and similar transactions and subject to vesting. 
 
 Class B Units 
 
 In March 2015, Carvana Group adopted the LLC Equity Incentive Plan. Under the LLC Equity Incentive Plan, Carvana Group could grant Class B Units to eligible employees, non-employee officers, consultants and directors with service-based vesting, typically four to . In connection with the completion of the IPO, Carvana Group discontinued the grant of new awards under the LLC Equity Incentive Plan, however the LLC Equity Incentive Plan will continue in connection with administration of existing awards that remain outstanding. Grantees may receive shares of the Company's Class A common stock in exchange for Class B Units on a four-to-five conversion ratio, or cash at the option of the Company, subject to conversion ratio adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends, reclassifications, and similar transactions and subject to vesting and the respective participation threshold for Class B Units. Class B Units do not expire. There were Class B Units issued during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. As of September 30, 2024, outstanding Class B Units had participation thresholds between to .

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, management performed an assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Management determined, based on the accounting standards applicable to such assessment, that there was sufficient evidence as a result of the Company s cumulative losses to conclude it was more likely than not that its deferred tax assets would not be realized and has recorded a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets. In the event that management was to determine that the Company would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be made which would reduce the provision for income taxes.

of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state or local tax that the Company actually realizes directly or indirectly (or are deemed to realize in certain circumstances) as a result of (i) certain tax attributes created as a result of any sales or exchanges (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) to or with the Company of their interests in Carvana Group for shares of Carvana Co.'s Class A common stock or cash, including any basis adjustment relating to the assets of Carvana Group and (ii) tax benefits attributable to payments made under the TRA (including imputed interest). The Company expects to benefit from the remaining of any tax benefits that it may actually realize. To the extent that the Company is unable to timely make payments under the TRA for any reason, such payments generally will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid. 
 
 If the Internal Revenue Service or a state or local taxing authority challenges the tax basis adjustments that give rise to payments under the TRA and the tax basis adjustments are subsequently disallowed, the recipients of payments under the agreement will not reimburse the Company for any payments the Company previously made to them. Any such disallowance would be taken into account in determining future payments under the TRA and would, therefore, reduce the amount of any such future payments. Nevertheless, if the claimed tax benefits from the tax basis adjustments are disallowed, the Company s payments under the TRA could exceed its actual tax savings, and the Company may not be able to recoup payments under the TRA that were calculated on the assumption that the disallowed tax savings were available. 
 
 The TRA provides that if (i) certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations, or other changes of control were to occur, (ii) there is a material breach of any material obligations under the TRA; or (iii) the Company elects an early termination of the TRA, then the TRA will terminate and the Company's obligations, or the Company's successor s obligations, under the TRA will accelerate and become due and payable, based on certain assumptions, including an assumption that the Company would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize all potential future tax benefits that are subject to the TRA and that any LLC Units that have not been exchanged are deemed exchanged for the fair market value of the Company's Class A common stock at the time of termination. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a TRA liability of million, of which million is due to related parties. As of September 30, 2024, million is included in other current liabilities and million is included in other liabilities on the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. For the remaining billion TRA liability, as of September 30, 2024, the Company has concluded, based on applicable accounting standards, that it was more likely than not that its deferred tax assets subject to the TRA would not be realized; therefore, the Company has not recorded an additional liability related to the tax savings it may realize from utilization of such deferred tax assets. If utilization of the deferred tax assets subject to the TRA becomes more likely than not in the future, the Company will record a liability related to the TRA which will be recognized in other expense (income), net within its consolidated statements of operations.

 Legal Matters 
 
 From time to time, the Company is involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business for a publicly traded auto retail and e-commerce company. For example, the Company is currently a party to legal and regulatory disputes, including intellectual property disputes, putative class action lawsuits, and shareholder derivative lawsuits, alleging, among other things, patent infringement, the violation of federal securities and antitrust laws and state laws regarding consumer protection, stockholders' rights, and the titling and registration of vehicles sold to its customers. These disputes include, but are not limited to, Carvana, LLC v. IBM Corp. , United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Case No. 7:23-cv-08616-KMK-VR); In re Carvana Co. Securities Litigation , United States District Court for the District of Arizona (Case No. CV-22-2126-PHX-MTL); Dana Jennings, et al. v. Carvana, LLC , United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (Case No. 5:21-cv-05400-EGS); Syretta Harvin, et al. v. Carvana, LLC et al. , United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (Case No. 2:23-cv-02068-MRP); and Michael Cribier v. Carvana, LLC , United States District Court for the Southern District of California (Case No. 3:24-cv-00094-DMS-JLB). 
 
 In re Carvana Co. Stockholders Litigation , Delaware Chancery Court (Case No. 2023-0600-KSJM) was dismissed in September 2024. 
 
 Additionally, the Attorney General offices of various states, from time to time, conduct inquiries regarding the Company's inspection, reconditioning, advertising, sale, delivery, titling, registration, and post-sale service of retail vehicles. The Company works closely with government agencies to respond to these requests and fully cooperates with any such inquiries, which if not amicably resolved, could result in state Attorney General offices filing claims against the Company. 
 
 The Company believes the claims or counterclaims against the Company in these legal matters are not material or are without merit and intends to defend the matters vigorously. It is not possible to determine the probability of loss or estimate damages, if any, for any of the above matters, and therefore, the Company has not established reserves for any of these proceedings. If the Company determines that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company will record a liability, and, if the liability is material, disclose the amount of the liability reserved. If an unfavorable ruling or development were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 
 
 Future litigation may be necessary to defend the Company and its partners by determining the scope, enforceability and validity of third party proprietary rights or to establish its proprietary rights. The results of any current or future litigation or government inquiries cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, litigation and government inquiries can have an adverse impact on the Company because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors.

 Money market funds consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and are classified in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 Beneficial Interests in Securitizations 
 
 Beneficial interests in securitizations include rated notes and certificates of the securitization trusts, the same securities as issued to other investors as described in Note 8 Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities. Beneficial interests in securitizations are initially treated as Level 2 assets when the securitization transaction occurs in close proximity to the end of the period and there is a lack of observable changes in the economic inputs. When the securitization transaction does not occur in close proximity to the end of the period and there have been observable changes in the economic inputs, beneficial interests in securitizations are classified as Level 3. 
 
 The Company's beneficial interests in securitizations include rated notes and certificates and other assets, all of which are classified as Level 3 due to the lack of observable market data. The Company determines the fair value of its rated notes based on non-binding broker quotes. The non-binding broker quotes are based on models that consider the prevailing interest rates, recent market transactions, and current business conditions. The Company determines the fair value of its certificates and other assets using a combination of non-binding market quotes and internally developed discounted cash flow models. The discounted cash flow models use discount rates based on prevailing interest rates and the characteristics of the specific instruments. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the range of discount rates were to and to , respectively, and the weighted average of discount rates were and , respectively. Significant increases or decreases in the inputs to the models could result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. The Company elected the fair value option on its beneficial interests in securitizations, which allows it to recognize changes in the fair value of these assets in the period the fair value changes. Changes in the fair value of the beneficial interests in securitizations are reflected in other expense (income), net in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 For beneficial interests in securitizations measured at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are deemed to have occurred at the beginning of the reporting period on a quarterly basis. There were no transfers out of Level 3 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023.

 Purchase Price Adjustment Receivables 
 
 The Company's purchase price adjustment receivables are carried at fair value and classified as other assets and other current assets in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. Under the MPSA, the purchaser will make future cash payments to the Company based on the performance of the finance receivables sold. The fair value of the purchase price adjustment receivables are determined based on the extent to which the Company s estimated performance of the underlying finance receivables exceeds a mutually agreed upon performance threshold of the underlying finance receivables as of measurement dates specified in the MPSA. The Company develops its estimate of future cumulative losses based on the historical performance of finance receivables it originated with similar characteristics as well as general macro-economic trends. The Company then utilizes a discounted cash flow model to calculate the present value of the expected future payment amounts. Due to the lack of observable market data these receivables are classified as Level 3. The adjustments to the fair value of the purchase price adjustment receivables were losses of less than million and million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and gains of less than million and million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and are reflected in other expense (income), net in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 Root Warrants 
 
 In October 2021, the Company purchased Series A convertible preferred shares in Root, Inc. ("Root"), an equity security that does not have a readily determinable fair value. The Company elected to measure this investment using a measurement alternative pursuant to the accounting standards and recorded the investment at its cost of million, which will subsequently be adjusted for observable price changes. The Company considered all relevant transactions since the date of its investment and has not recorded any impairments or upward or downward adjustments to the carrying amount of its investment in Root, as there have not been changes in the observable price of its equity interest through September 30, 2024. 
 
 Also in October 2021, the Company entered into a commercial agreement with Root, under which the Root auto insurance products were to be embedded into the Company's e-commerce platform. In accordance with the provisions of the commercial agreement, the Company received tranches of warrants to purchase shares of Root's Class A common stock (the "Root Warrants"). On September 1, 2022, the integrated auto insurance solution, which embedded into the Company's e-commerce platform, was completed. The first tranche of Root Warrants, consisting of million shares of Root's Class A common stock, became exercisable upon completion of the integrated solution, and is considered a derivative instrument. The second tranche of Root Warrants, consisting of million shares of Root's Class A common stock, became exercisable on November 14, 2023,

CARVANA CO. AND SUBSIDIARIES

 million shares of Root's Class A common stock, became exercisable on May 3, 2024. Both the second and third tranche of the Root Warrants became exercisable upon the achievement of certain insurance sales metrics through the integrated solution, and are considered derivative investments. The other tranches vest based on a combination of the arrival of certain dates and insurance product sales through the integrated solution, and are considered derivative instruments. The Company used a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the fair value of these Root Warrants, which are classified as Level 3. Under this Monte Carlo simulation, the primary unobservable input utilized in determining the fair value of the Root Warrants was the expected volatility of Root's class A common stock, which was implied from the historical volatility of their stock. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the expected volatility utilized in the Monte Carlo simulation was and , respectively. At contract inception, the Company recognized an asset of million for the Root Warrants and deferred revenue, classified in other assets and other liabilities, respectively in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. In 2022, the Company determined it was probable that the volume of insurance products required to earn the Root Warrants would be achieved and recorded an additional million of Root Warrants and deferred revenue based on the contract inception date fair value as determined by the Monte Carlo simulation. The Root Warrants and deferred revenue are classified in other assets and other liabilities, respectively, in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. The deferred revenue is recognized over the expected contract performance period within other sales and revenues in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.

In relation to the Root Warrants, the Company recognized a decrease in fair value of million and an increase in fair value of million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and increases in fair value of million and million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which are included in other expense (income), net in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 Interest Rate Caps 
 
 The Company utilizes non-designated cash flow hedges including interest rate cap agreements to minimize its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on variable rate debt borrowings. Interest rate caps provide that the counterparty will pay the purchaser at the end of each contractual period in which the index interest rate exceeds the contractually agreed upon cap rate. 
 
 In the first quarter of 2023, the Company entered into interest rate cap agreement to limit exposure to interest rate risk on variable rate debt associated with finance receivables. The interest rate cap has a cap rate of with a notional amount of million, expiring in July 2027. In the second quarter of 2023, the Company entered into a second interest rate cap agreement to limit exposure to interest rate risk on variable rate debt associated with finance receivables. The interest rate cap has a cap rate of and a notional amount of million, expiring in April 2027. 
 
 The fair value of the Company's interest rate caps is impacted by the credit risk of both the Company and its counterparty. The Company has an agreement with its derivative financial instrument counterparty that contains provisions providing that if the Company defaults on the indebtedness associated with its derivative financial instrument, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative financial instrument obligation. In addition, the Company minimizes nonperformance risk on its derivative instrument by evaluating the creditworthiness of its counterparty, which is limited to major banks and financial institutions. 
 
 The Company does not apply hedge accounting to the interest rate caps and records all mark-to-market adjustments directly to other expense (income), net in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of the interest rate caps is categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as they are based on well-recognized financial

 million and less than million of expense, respectively, within other expense (income), net in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. The interest rate caps were terminated during the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 
 The carrying amounts of restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and accounts payable to related party approximate fair value due to their respective short-term maturities. The carrying value of the short-term revolving facilities were determined to approximate fair value due to their short-term duration and variable interest rates that approximate prevailing interest rates as of each reporting period. The carrying value of notes payable and sale leasebacks were determined to approximate fair value as each of the transactions were entered into at prevailing interest rates during each respective period and they have not materially changed as of or during the periods ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The carrying value of the financing of beneficial interests in securitizations was determined to approximate fair value because in the event of a decline in the fair value of the pledged collateral of the financing, the repurchase price of the pledged collateral will be increased by the amount of the decline. 
 
 The fair value of the Senior Notes, which are not carried at fair value on the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets, was determined using Level 2 inputs based on quoted market prices for the identical liability.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 
 Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this report to "Carvana," the "Company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Carvana Co. and its consolidated subsidiaries. The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD A") is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited consolidated financial statements, the accompanying notes and the MD A included in our most recent Annual Report filed on Form 10-K, as well as our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 

Overview 
 
 Carvana is the leading e-commerce platform for buying and selling used cars. We are transforming the used car buying and selling experience by giving consumers what they want - a wide selection, great value and quality, transparent pricing, and a simple, no pressure transaction. Each element of our business, from inventory procurement to fulfillment and overall ease of the online transaction, has been built for this singular purpose. 
 
 Our business combines a comprehensive online sales experience with a vertically integrated supply chain that allows us to sell high-quality vehicles to our customers transparently and efficiently at a low price. Using our website or mobile application, customers can complete all phases of a retail vehicle purchase transaction. Specifically, our online sales experience allows customers to: 
 
 Purchase a retail vehicle. As of September 30, 2024, we listed 45,974 total retail units on our website, where customers can select and purchase a vehicle, including arranging financing and signing contracts, directly from their desktop or mobile device. Selling vehicles to retail customers is the primary driver of our business. Selling retail vehicles generates revenue equal to the selling price of the vehicle, less an allowance for returns, and also enables multiple additional revenue streams, including the sale of finance receivables originated to finance the vehicle, vehicle service contracts ("VSCs"), GAP waiver coverage, other ancillary products, and trade-ins. 
 
 Finance their purchase. Customers can pay for their Carvana vehicle using cash, financing from other parties such as banks or credit unions, or financing with us using our proprietary loan origination platform. Customers who choose to apply for our in-house financing fill out a short prequalification form, select from a range of financing terms we provide and, if approved, apply the financing to their purchase in our online checkout process. We generally seek to sell the loans we originate to financing partners or pursuant to a securitization transaction and, in each case, we generally earn a premium upon sale. 
 
 Protect their purchase. Customers have the option to protect their vehicle with a VSC as part of our online checkout process. VSCs provide customers with protection against the costs of certain mechanical repairs after the expiration of their vehicle s original manufacturer warranty. We earn a fee for selling VSCs on behalf of an affiliate of DriveTime Automotive Group, Inc. (together with its consolidated affiliates, collectively, DriveTime ), which is the obligor under these VSCs. We generally have no contractual liability to customers for claims under these agreements. We also offer GAP waiver coverage to customers in most states in which we operate. We have additionally partnered with Root, Inc. ("Root") to offer an integrated auto insurance solution, through which customers in most states may conveniently access auto insurance directly from the Carvana e-commerce platform. 
 
 Sell us their car. We allow our customers to trade-in a vehicle and apply the trade-in value to their purchase, or to sell us a vehicle independent of a purchase. Using our digital appraisal tool, customers can receive a conditional offer for their vehicle nearly instantaneously from our site simply by answering a few questions about the vehicle condition and features. We generate trade-in offers using a proprietary valuation algorithm supported by extensive used vehicle market and customer-behavior data. When customers accept our offer, they can drop the vehicle off at one of our locations or schedule a time to have the vehicle picked up at their home or elsewhere within one of our markets and receive payment, eliminating the need to visit a dealership or negotiate a private sale. We take their vehicles into inventory and sell them either at auction as a wholesale sale or through our website as a retail sale. Vehicles sold at auction typically do not meet the quality or condition standards required to be included in retail inventory displayed for sale on our website.

To enable a seamless customer experience, we have built a vertically-integrated used vehicle supply chain, supported by proprietary software systems and data. 
 
 Vehicle acquisition. We primarily acquire our used vehicle inventory directly from customers when they trade in or sell us their vehicles and through the large and liquid national used car auction market. Acquiring directly from customers eliminates auction fees and provides more diverse vehicles. The remainder of our inventory is acquired from vehicle finance and leasing companies, rental car companies, and other suppliers, which suppliers may also provide reconditioning services. We use proprietary algorithms to determine which cars to bid on at auction and how much to bid. Our software sifts through over 100,000 vehicles per day and filters out vehicles with poor condition ratings or other unacceptable attributes, and can evaluate the tens of thousands of potential vehicle purchases that remain per day, creating a competitive advantage versus in-person sourcing methods generally used by traditional dealerships. Once our algorithms have identified a suitable vehicle for purchase, bids are verified and executed by a centralized team of inventory-sourcing professionals. For vehicles sold to us through our website, we use proprietary algorithms to determine an appropriate offer. We assess vehicles on the basis of quality, inventory fit, consumer desirability, relative value, expected reconditioning costs, and vehicle location to identify what we believe represent the most in-demand and profitable vehicles to acquire for inventory. We utilize a broad range of data sources, including proprietary site data, and a variety of external data sources to support our assessments. 
 
 Inspection and reconditioning. Once we acquire a vehicle from a customer, we leverage our in-house logistics or a vendor to transport the vehicle to an inspection and reconditioning center or auction location with reconditioning capacity ("IRC"), at which point the vehicle is entered into our inventory management system. We then begin a 150-point inspection process covering controls, features, brakes, tires, and cosmetics. Each IRC includes trained technicians, vehicle lifts, paint-less dent repair, and paint capabilities and receives on-site support from vendors with whom we have integrated systems to ensure ready access to parts and materials. When an inspection is complete, we estimate the necessary reconditioning cost for the vehicle to meet our standards and expected timing for that vehicle to be made available for sale on our website. 
 
 Photography and merchandising. To provide transparency to our customers, our patented, automated photo booths capture a 360-degree exterior and interior virtual tour of each vehicle in our website inventory. Our photo booths photograph the interior and exterior of the vehicle while technicians annotate material defects based on visibility-threshold category. We also feature integrations with various vehicle data providers for vehicle feature and option information. We have instituted a unified cosmetic standard across all IRCs and certain auction sites to better ensure a consistent customer experience. 
 
 Transportation and fulfillment. Third-party vehicle transportation is often slow, expensive, and unreliable. To address these challenges, we built an in-house auto logistics network backed by a proprietary transportation management system ("TMS") to transport our vehicles to customers in our markets. The system is based on a "hub and spoke" model, which connects all IRCs to vending machines and hubs via our owned and leased fleet of multi-car and single car haulers. Our TMS allows us to efficiently manage locations, routes, route capacities, trucks, and drivers while also dynamically optimizing for speed and cost. We store inventory primarily at the IRCs and other sites, and when a vehicle is sold, it is delivered directly to customers in our markets or transported to a vending machine or certain hubs for pick-up by the customer. Due to our robust and proprietary logistics infrastructure, we are able to offer our customers and operations team highly accurate predictions of vehicle availability, minimizing unanticipated delays and ensuring a seamless and reliable customer experience. 

Retail Vehicle Unit Sales 
 
 Since launching to customers in Atlanta, Georgia in January 2013, we have historically experienced rapid growth in sales through our website www.carvana.com. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the number of vehicles we sold to retail customers increased by 34.2 to 108,651, compared to 80,987 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the 
 40 

nine months ended September 30, 2024, the number of vehicles we sold to retail customers increased by 27.5 to 301,969, compared to 236,757 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 We continue to view the number of vehicles we sell to retail customers as the most important long-term measure of our performance, and we expect to continue to focus on building a scalable platform to efficiently increase our retail units sold. This focus on retail units sold is motivated by several factors: 
 
 Retail units sold enable multiple revenue streams, including the sale of the vehicle itself, the sale of finance receivables originated to finance the vehicle, the sale of VSCs, GAP waiver coverage, other ancillary products, and the sale of vehicles acquired from customers. 
 
 Retail units sold are the primary driver of customer referrals and repeat sales. Each time we sell a vehicle to a new customer, that customer may refer future customers and can become a repeat buyer in the future. 
 
 Retail units sold are an important driver of the average number of days between when we acquire the vehicle and when we sell it. Reducing average days to sale impacts gross profit on our vehicles because used vehicles generally depreciate over time. 
 
 Retail units sold allow us to benefit from economies of scale due to our centralized online sales model. We believe our model provides meaningful operating leverage in acquisition, reconditioning, transport, customer service, and delivery. 
 
 We are simultaneously maintaining our focus on efficiency gains and other profitability initiatives, while continuing to invest in technology and infrastructure to support efficient growth in retail units sold. This includes continued investment in our vehicle acquisition, reconditioning and logistics network, as well as continued investment in product development and engineering to deliver customers a best-in-class experience. 

Markets and Population Coverage 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have established a logistics network and local marketing presence in 316 metropolitan areas and have purchased, reconditioned, sold, and delivered over 2.0 million retail vehicles since the launch of our first market in January 2013. As of September 30, 2024, our 316 markets serviced 81.1 of the U.S. population. We calculate our population coverage as the population in our open markets at the end of the period as a percentage of the total metropolitan statistical area ("MSA") population in the U.S., based on 2015 data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Our hub and spoke market approach allows us to focus on serving our markets and providing the best possible car buying and selling experience to our customers at a low, transparent cost. Our established logistics network and ability to service customers within our markets by delivering or picking up any car on Carvana-branded haulers allow us to provide a low-cost, simple car buying and selling experience. We continually evaluate consumer demand and our operational capacity to determine our market development strategy. 

Revenue and Gross Profit 
 
 We generate revenue on retail units sold from four primary sources: the sale of the retail vehicles, wholesale sales of vehicles we acquire from customers, including sales through our wholesale marketplace, gains on the sales of loans originated to finance the vehicles, and sales of ancillary products such as VSCs and GAP waiver coverage. 
 
 Our largest source of revenue, retail vehicle sales, totaled 2.5 billion and 1.9 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 7.1 billion and 5.7 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We generally expect retail vehicle sales to trend proportionately with retail units sold, absent any material changes in macroeconomic conditions. We generate gross profit on retail vehicle sales from the difference between the retail selling price of the vehicle and our cost of sales associated with acquiring the vehicle and preparing it for sale. 
 
 Wholesale sales and revenues includes sales of trade-ins and other vehicles acquired from customers that do not meet the requirements for our retail inventory. We also include revenue earned from the sale of wholesale marketplace units by non-Carvana sellers through our wholesale marketplace platform, including auction fees and related service revenues, in wholesale sales and revenues. Wholesale sales and revenues totaled 786 million and 610 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 2.2 billion and 2.0 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We generally expect wholesale sales to trend proportionately with retail units sold through trade-ins and from customers who wish to sell us a car independent of a retail sale and with the movement of wholesale marketplace units. We generate gross profit on wholesale vehicle sales from the difference between the wholesale selling price of the vehicle and 
 41 

our cost of sales associated with acquiring the vehicle and preparing it for sale. We generate a gross profit on wholesale marketplace units from the difference between the revenue earned from the sale of wholesale marketplace units through our wholesale marketplace platform less our cost of sales associated with operating the wholesale marketplace platform. 
 
 Other sales and revenues, which primarily includes gains on the sales of finance receivables we originate and sales commissions on ancillary products such as VSCs, GAP waiver coverage, and auto insurance totaled 326 million and 214 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and 834 million and 605 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We generally expect other sales and revenues to trend proportionately with retail units sold. We also expect other sales and revenues to increase as we improve our ability to monetize loans we originate, including through securitization transactions, and sell and offer attractive financing solutions and ancillary products to our customers, including products customarily sold by automotive retailers or insurance products customarily sold by traditional insurance companies, absent any material changes in macroeconomic conditions. Other sales and revenues are 100 gross margin products for which gross profit equals revenue. 
 
 Our highest priority continues to be providing exceptional customer experiences while improving efficiency and utilizing our infrastructure to support efficient growth in retail units sold to help us move along the path to achieve sustained profitability. Efficient growth initiatives, which we may undertake from time to time, include the following: 
 
 Increase the purchase of vehicles from customers. Over time, we plan to grow the number of vehicles that we purchase from our customers as trade-ins or independent of a retail sale. This will provide additional vehicles for our retail business, which on average are more profitable compared to the same vehicle acquired at auction, and expand our inventory selection. In addition, this in turn will grow our wholesale business. 
 
 Optimize average days to sale. Our goal is generally to optimize our inventory size relative to sales to achieve our desired average days to sale. Reductions in average days to sale lead to fewer vehicle price reductions, and therefore higher average selling prices, all other factors being equal. Higher average selling prices in turn lead to higher gross profit per unit sold, all other factors being equal. 
 
 Leverage existing inspection and reconditioning infrastructure. As we scale, we intend to more fully utilize the capacity at our existing IRCs and auction locations, which collectively have capacity to inspect and recondition more than 1 million vehicles per year at full utilization . 
 
 Expand our logistics network. As we scale, we intend to further expand our in-house logistics network to transport cars to our IRCs or other sites after acquisition from customers or wholesale auctions. 
 
 Increase conversion on existing products. We plan to continue to improve our website to highlight the benefits of our complementary product offerings, including financing, VSCs, GAP waiver coverage, other ancillary products, and trade-ins. 
 
 Add new products and services. We plan to utilize our online sales platform to offer additional complementary products and services to our customers. 
 
 Increase monetization of our finance receivables. We plan to continue selling finance receivables in securitization transactions and otherwise expand our base of financial partners who purchase the finance receivables originated on our platform to reduce our effective cost of funds. 
 
 Optimize purchasing and pricing. We are constantly improving the ways in which we predict customer demand, value vehicles sight unseen and optimize what we pay to acquire those vehicles. We also regularly test different pricing of our products, including vehicle sticker prices, trade-in and independent vehicle offers, and ancillary product prices, and we believe we can improve by further optimizing prices over time. 

Seasonality 
 
 Retail and wholesale used vehicle sales generally exhibit seasonality with sales peaking late in the first calendar quarter and diminishing through the rest of the year, with the lowest relative level of vehicle sales expected to occur in the fourth calendar quarter. Due to our historical rapid growth and continuing growth in the current year, our overall sales patterns in the past have not always reflected the general seasonality of the used vehicle industry. However, as our business and markets have continued to mature, our results have become more reflective of typical market seasonality. Used vehicle prices also exhibit seasonality, 
 42 

with used vehicles depreciating at a faster rate in the last two quarters of each year and a slower rate in the first two quarters of each year, all other factors being equal. We expect to experience seasonal and other fluctuations in our quarterly operating results, including as a result of macroeconomic conditions, which may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. 
 
 Investment in Growth 
 
 For the past several quarters we have been and continue to be focused on driving fundamental gains in gross profit per unit and operational efficiency, flexibility, and scalability through process and technology improvements to increase profitability and provide a strong foundation for profitable growth. As we continue targeting initiatives aimed at improving efficiencies, we are simultaneously investing in the profitable expansion of our business. While we intend to become increasingly efficient over time, we also anticipate that our operating expenses will increase as we return to growth and continue to expand our logistics network, increase our advertising spending, and serve more of the U.S. population. There is no guarantee that we will be able to realize the desired return on our investments.

Key Operating Metrics 
 
 We regularly review a number of metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our progress and make strategic decisions. Our key operating metrics reflect the key drivers of our growth, including increasing brand awareness, enhancing the selection of vehicles we make available to our customers, and driving strong unit economics. 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Retail units sold 108,651 80,987 301,969 236,757 Average monthly unique visitors (in thousands) 17,321 16,436 17,518 16,119 Total website units 45,974 34,090 45,974 34,090 Total gross profit per unit 7,427 5,952 6,998 5,583 Total gross profit per unit, non-GAAP 7,685 6,396 7,302 6,065 
 
 Retail Units Sold 
 
 We define retail units sold as the number of vehicles sold to customers in a given period, net of returns under our seven-day return policy. We view retail units sold as a key measure of our growth for several reasons. First, retail units sold is the primary driver of our revenues and, indirectly, gross profit, since retail unit sales enable multiple complementary revenue streams, including financing, VSCs, GAP waiver coverage, other ancillary products, and trade-ins. Second, growth in retail units sold increases the base of available customers for referrals and repeat sales. Third, growth in retail units sold is an indicator of our ability to successfully scale our logistics, fulfillment, and customer service operations. 
 
 Average Monthly Unique Visitors 
 
 We define a monthly unique visitor as an individual who has visited our website or iOS/Android application within a calendar month, based on data provided by Google Analytics. We calculate average monthly unique visitors as the sum of monthly unique visitors in a given period, divided by the number of months in that period. We view average monthly unique visitors as a key indicator of the strength of our brand, the effectiveness of our advertising and merchandising campaigns, and consumer awareness of our brand. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, the methodology used by Google Analytics to count unique visitors changed to include individuals visiting our iOS/Android application, in addition to those visiting our website. We believe this change allows us to more accurately calculate and reflect average monthly unique visitors. To conform to current period presentation, we have recast average monthly unique visitors for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and three months ended March 31, 2024. The change in measurement methodology resulted in 8.1 and 8.8 more 
 43 

average monthly unique visitors for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, and 4.2 more average monthly unique visitors for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to previously reported numbers. 
 
 Total Website Units 
 
 We define total website units as the number of vehicles listed on our website on the last day of a given reporting period, including vehicles available for sale, vehicles currently engaged in a purchase or reserved by a customer, and vehicles that can be reserved that generally have not yet completed the inspection and reconditioning process. We view total website units as a key measure of our growth. Growth in total website units increases the selection of vehicles available to our consumers, which we believe will allow us to increase the number of vehicles we sell over time. Moreover, growth in total website units indicates our ability to scale our vehicle purchasing, inspection and reconditioning operations. As part of our inventory strategy, over time we may choose not to expand total website units while continuing to grow sales, thereby improving other key operating metrics of the business. 
 
 Total Gross Profit per Unit 
 
 We define total gross profit per unit as the aggregate gross profit in a given period, divided by retail units sold in that period including gross profit generated from the sale of retail vehicles, gains on the sales of loans originated to finance the vehicles, commissions on sales of VSCs, GAP waiver coverage and other ancillary products, and gross profit generated from wholesale sales of vehicles. We operate an integrated business with the objective of increasing the number of retail units sold and total gross profit per unit. Gross profits generated from the sale of retail and wholesale units are interrelated. For example, our nationwide reconditioning and inspection centers are designed to produce vehicles for both retail and wholesale sales, our vehicle storage locations have shared parking for both retail and wholesale vehicles, and our integrated multi-vehicle logistics and last mile delivery network is operated in service of both retail and wholesale sales. Such interrelationships require us to share finite operational capacity and optimize joint decisions between retail and wholesale sales, in order to position us to achieve our objective of increasing total gross profit per unit. As a result, the inclusion of gross profit generated from wholesale sales of vehicles in total gross profit per unit reflects our integrated business model and the interrelationship between wholesale and retail vehicle sales. We believe the total gross profit per unit metrics provide investors with the greatest opportunity to view our performance through the same lens that our management does, and therefore assists investors to best evaluate our business and measure our progress. 
 
 Total Gross Profit per Unit, Non-GAAP 
 
 We define total gross profit per unit, non-GAAP as the aggregate gross profit, non-GAAP in a given period, divided by retail units sold in that period. Gross profit, non-GAAP is defined as gross profit plus depreciation and amortization expense in cost of sales, share-based compensation expense in cost of sales, and restructuring expense, minus revenue related to warrants to purchase shares of Root's Class A common stock (the "Root Warrants") as discussed in Note 17 Fair Value of Financial Instruments. Refer to "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for more information, including the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"). 

Components of Results of Operations 
 
 Retail Vehicle Sales 
 
 Retail vehicle sales represent the aggregate sales of used vehicles to customers through our website. Revenue from retail vehicle sales is recognized upon delivery to the customer or pick up of the vehicle by the customer, and is reported net of a reserve for expected returns. Factors affecting retail vehicle sales revenue include the number of retail units sold and the average selling price of these vehicles. Changes in retail units sold are a much larger driver of changes in revenue than are changes in average selling price. 
 
 Retail vehicle sales also include shipping and delivery fees and service revenue from retail marketplace transactions, which are retail vehicles sold to customers on consignment from our partners. As we are the agent in retail marketplace transactions, we recognize revenue on the sale of the vehicle on a net basis, rather than recognizing the full amount of the vehicle sales price as revenue. As a result, an increase in retail marketplace units sold as a percent of total retail units sold would lead to a decrease in retail revenue per unit sold, and vice versa, other things being equal. 
 
 44 

The number of retail vehicles we sell depends on the volume of traffic to our website, our population coverage, our inventory selection, the effectiveness of our branding and marketing efforts, the quality of our customers' purchase experience, our volume of referrals and repeat customers, the competitiveness of our pricing, competition from other used car dealerships and general macroeconomic and used car industry conditions. On a quarterly basis, the number of retail vehicles we sell is also affected by seasonality, with demand for retail vehicles generally reaching a seasonal high point late in the first quarter of each year, commensurate with the timing of tax refunds, and diminishing through the rest of the year, with the lowest relative level of retail vehicle sales generally expected to occur in the fourth calendar quarter. In 2023, heightened inflation and rising interest rates resulted in lower demand for used vehicles. Heightened inflation and interest rates persisted during the first three months of 2024, and, to a lesser extent, during the second and third quarters of 2024, but were outweighed by seasonal demand associated with the timing of tax refunds and certain of our initiatives focused on growth in retail units sold. 
 
 Our revenue per retail unit depends on macroeconomic and used car industry conditions, the mix of vehicles we acquire, retail prices in our markets, our pricing strategy, and our average days to sale. We may choose to shift our inventory mix to higher or lower cost vehicles, or to raise or lower our prices relative to market to take advantage of supply or demand imbalances, which could temporarily lead to revenue per retail unit increasing or decreasing. We also generally expect lower average days to sale to be associated with higher retail revenue per retail unit due to decreased vehicle depreciation prior to sale, all other factors being equal. 
 
 Wholesale Sales and Revenues 
 
 Wholesale sales and revenues includes the aggregate proceeds we receive on vehicles we acquire and sell to wholesalers, and wholesale marketplace revenues. The vehicles we sell to wholesalers are primarily acquired from customers who sell a vehicle to us without purchasing a retail vehicle and from our customers who trade-in their existing vehicles when making a purchase from us. Factors affecting wholesale sales and revenues include the number of wholesale units sold and the average wholesale selling price of these vehicles. The average selling price of our wholesale units is primarily driven by the mix of vehicles we sell to wholesalers, as well as general supply and demand conditions in the applicable wholesale vehicle market, including the level of depreciation in the wholesale vehicle market. Wholesale sales and revenues includes aggregate proceeds we receive on vehicles sold to DriveTime through competitive online auctions that are managed by an unrelated third party and through the Company's wholesale marketplace platform. Wholesale marketplace revenues include revenue earned from the sale of wholesale marketplace units by third-party sellers to buyers through our wholesale marketplace platform, including auction fees and related services revenue. 
 
 Other Sales and Revenues 
 
 We generate other sales and revenues primarily through the sales of loans we originate and sell in securitization transactions or to financing partners, reported net of a reserve for expected repurchases, commissions we receive on VSCs, sales of GAP waiver coverage, and commissions and Root Warrants we receive on sales of auto insurance. 
 
 We generally seek to sell the loans we originate to securitization trusts we sponsor and establish or to financing partners. The securitization trusts issue asset-backed securities, some of which are collateralized by the finance receivables that we sell to the securitization trusts. We also sell the loans we originate under committed forward-flow arrangements, including a master purchase and sale agreement, and through fixed pool loan sales, with financing partners who generally acquire them at premium prices without recourse to us for their post-sale performance. Factors affecting revenue from these sales include the number of loans we originate, the average principal balance of the loans, the credit quality of the portfolio, the price at which we are able to sell them in securitization transactions or to financing partners, and economic conditions in the capital markets. 
 
 The number of loans we originate is driven by the number of retail vehicles sold and the percentage of our sales for which we provide financing, which is influenced by the financing terms we offer our customers relative to alternatives available to the customer. The average principal balance is driven primarily by the mix of vehicles we sell, since higher average selling prices typically mean higher average balances. The price at which we sell the loan is driven by the terms of our securitization transactions and forward-flow arrangement, applicable interest rates, and whether or not the loan includes GAP waiver coverage. 
 
 In 2016, we entered into a master dealer agreement with DriveTime, pursuant to which we receive a commission for selling VSCs that DriveTime administers. The commission revenue we recognize on VSCs depends on the number of retail units we sell, the conversion rate of VSCs on these sales, commission rates we receive, VSC early cancellation frequency and product features. The GAP waiver coverage revenue we recognize depends on the number of retail units we sell, the number of 
 45 

customers that choose to finance their purchases with us, the frequency of GAP waiver coverage early cancellation, and the conversion rate of GAP waiver coverage on those sales. 
 
 In September 2022, we completed our integrated auto insurance solution with Root, through which customers may conveniently access auto insurance directly from the Carvana e-commerce platform. We receive commissions and Root Warrants based on the Root insurance policies sold through the integrated solution. The commission revenue we recognize depends on the number of retail units we sell, the conversion rate of auto policies on those sales, commission rates we receive, and forecasted attrition. The revenue we recognize from Root Warrants as non-cash consideration depends on the probability of achieving certain auto policy sales thresholds within a specific timeline as well as our performance under the agreement with Root. 
 
 Cost of Sales 
 
 Cost of sales includes the cost to acquire, recondition, and transport vehicles associated with preparing them for resale, and wholesale marketplace cost of sales. Vehicle acquisition costs are driven by the mix of vehicles we acquire, the source of those vehicles, and supply-and-demand dynamics in the vehicle market. Reconditioning costs consist of direct costs, including parts, labor, and third-party repair expenses directly attributable to specific vehicles, as well as indirect costs, such as IRC overhead. Transportation costs consist of costs incurred to transport the vehicles from the point of acquisition to the IRC or other site. Cost of sales also includes any necessary adjustments to reflect vehicle inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Wholesale marketplace cost of sales include costs related to the sale of wholesale marketplace units by third-party sellers through our wholesale marketplace platform, including labor, rent, depreciation and amortization. 
 
 Retail Vehicle Gross Profit 
 
 Retail vehicle gross profit is the retail vehicle sales minus our costs of sales associated with vehicles that we list and sell on our website. Retail vehicle gross profit per unit is our aggregate retail vehicle gross profit in any measurement period divided by the number of retail units sold in that period. 
 
 Wholesale Gross Profit 
 
 Wholesale gross profit is the vehicle sales price minus our cost of sales associated with vehicles we sell to wholesalers, and wholesale marketplace revenues less wholesale marketplace cost of sales. Factors affecting wholesale gross profit include the number of wholesale units sold, the average wholesale selling price of these vehicles, the average acquisition price associated with these vehicles, the buyer and seller fees, and the number of wholesale marketplace units sold. 
 
 Other Gross Profit 
 
 Other sales and revenues consist of 100 gross margin products for which gross profit equals revenue. Therefore, changes in gross profit and the associated drivers are identical to changes in revenues from these products and the associated drivers. 
 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 SG A expenses include expenses associated with advertising and providing customer service to customers, operating our vending machines, hubs, physical auctions, logistics and fulfillment network and other corporate overhead expenses, including expenses associated with information technology, product development, engineering, legal, accounting, finance, and business development. SG A expenses exclude the costs of inspecting and reconditioning vehicles and transporting vehicles from the point of acquisition to the IRC, which are included in cost of sales, and payroll costs for our employees related to the 
 46 

development of software products for internal use, which are capitalized to software and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. 
 
 Other Operating Expense, Net 
 
 Other operating expense, net primarily includes other general operating expenses such as gains or losses from disposals of long-lived assets. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 
 Interest expense includes interest incurred on our various tranches of Senior Secured Notes and Senior Unsecured Notes, our Floor Plan Facility, and our Finance Receivable Facilities (each as defined in Note 9 Debt Instruments of our financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q), as well as our notes payable, finance leases, and long-term debt, which are used to fund general working capital, our inventory, our transportation fleet, and certain of our property and equipment. Interest expense also includes amortization of capitalized debt issuance costs, which is offset by amortization of debt premium and interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents. Interest expense excludes the interest incurred during various construction projects to build, upgrade or remodel certain facilities, which is capitalized to property and equipment and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. 
 
 Other Expense (Income), Net 
 
 Other expense (income), net includes changes in fair value on our beneficial interests in securitizations, purchase price adjustment receivables, and fair value adjustments related to our Root Warrants as discussed in Note 17 Fair Value of Financial Instruments of our financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Other expense (income), net also includes expense related to our Tax Receivable Agreement ("TRA") liability. Refer to Note 14 Income Taxes for further discussion of the TRA. 
 
 Income Tax (Benefit) Provision 
 
 Income taxes are recognized based upon our anticipated underlying annual blended federal and state income tax rates adjusted, as necessary, for any discrete tax matters occurring during the period. As the sole managing member of Carvana Group, LLC (together with its subsidiaries Carvana Group ), Carvana Co. consolidates the financial results of Carvana Group. Carvana Group, LLC is treated as a partnership and therefore not subject to U.S. federal and most applicable state and local income tax purposes. Any taxable income or loss generated by Carvana Group is passed through to and included in the taxable income or loss of its members, including Carvana Co., based on its economic interest held in Carvana Group. Carvana Co. is taxed as a corporation and is subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes with respect to its allocable share of any taxable income or loss of Carvana Group, as well as any stand-alone income or loss generated by Carvana Co.

 Retail Vehicle Sales 
 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 versus 2023. Retail vehicle sales increased by 594 million to 2.5 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.9 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in revenue was primarily due to an increase in the number of retail vehicles sold to 108,651 from 80,987 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in retail revenue per retail unit sold to 23,405 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 24,066 in the prior year, due primarily to higher overall 
 48 

depreciation in the used vehicle market, partially offset by faster turn times and vehicle mix, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus 2023. Retail vehicle sales increased by 1.4 billion to 7.1 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.7 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in revenue was primarily due to an increase in the number of retail vehicles sold to 301,969 from 236,757 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in retail revenue per retail unit sold to 23,608 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 24,232 in the prior year, due primarily to higher overall depreciation in the used vehicle market, partially offset by faster turn times and vehicle mix, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Wholesale Sales and Revenues 
 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 versus 2023. Wholesale sales and revenues increased by 176 million to 786 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 610 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in revenue was primarily due to an increase in the number of wholesale units sold to 56,487 from 40,886 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, along with an increase in the wholesale revenue per wholesale unit sold to 9,861 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 9,612 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, wholesale marketplace revenues were higher during the three months ended September 30, 2024 at 229 million, compared to 217 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in the number of wholesale marketplace units sold to 234,361 from 221,368 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 Versus 2023. Wholesale sales and revenues increased by 158 million to 2.2 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.0 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in revenue was primarily due to an increase in the number of wholesale units sold to 151,010 from 122,449 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This increase was partially offset by higher overall depreciation in the wholesale vehicle market as the wholesale revenue per wholesale unit sold decreased to 9,688 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 11,058 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, wholesale marketplace revenues were higher during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 at 700 million, compared to 651 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in the number of wholesale marketplace units sold to 724,143 from 662,830 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Other Sales and Revenues 
 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 versus 2023. Other sales and revenues increased by 112 million to 326 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 214 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in gain on loan sales as a result of more loans sold, higher loan sale spreads, increased retail units sold, and higher interest income due to higher levels of finance receivables held for sale during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus 2023. Other sales and revenues increased by 229 million to 834 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 605 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in gain on loan sales as a result of more loans sold, higher loan sale spreads, and increased retail units sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Retail vehicle gross profit increased by 162 million to 380 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 218 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was driven primarily by an increase in retail vehicle gross profit per unit to 3,497 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2,692 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The per unit increase was primarily driven by lower average days to sale, lower vehicle acquisition costs relative to sales prices, and lower reconditioning and inbound transport costs on retail vehicles sold during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 Versus 2023. Retail vehicle gross profit increased by 478 million to 1.0 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 532 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

The increase in wholesale units sold was primarily a result of an increase in overall vehicle acquisitions during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in wholesale vehicle gross profit per wholesale unit was primarily a result of lower vehicle acquisition costs relative to sales prices during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, the increase was driven by an increase in wholesale marketplace gross profit by 18 million to 40 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 22 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to an increase in the number of wholesale marketplace units sold to 234,361 from 221,368 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus 2023. Wholesale gross profit increased by 84 million to 269 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 185 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in wholesale units sold to 151,010 from 122,449 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, along with an increase in wholesale vehicle gross profit per wholesale unit to 1,026 from 906, respectively. The increase in wholesale units sold was primarily a result of an increase in overall vehicle acquisitions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in wholesale vehicle gross profit per wholesale unit was primarily a result of lower vehicle acquisition costs relative to sales prices during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, the increase was driven by an increase in wholesale marketplace gross profit by 40 million to 114 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 74 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to an increase in the number of wholesale marketplace units sold to 724,143 from 662,830 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Other Gross Profit 
 
 Other sales and revenues consist of 100 gross margin products for which gross profit equals revenue. Therefore, changes in other gross profit and the associated drivers are identical to changes in other sales and revenues and the associated drivers.

Loss on debt extinguishment was 6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to the repurchase of 350 million of 2028 Senior Secured Notes in the open market for 363 million, which included 8 million of accrued interest and 1 million in pro-rata write-offs of unamortized debt issuance costs and unamortized premium. Gain on debt extinguishment was 878 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the exchange of 5.5 billion in principal of Senior Unsecured Notes for 4.2 billion in principal of Senior Secured Notes and 341 million in cash, along with the write off of 66 million of debt issuance costs and a 40 million deferred premium on a portion of the Senior Secured Notes. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 
 Interest expense increased by 4 million and 36 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, primarily due to increased PIK interest on the 
 51 

Senior Secured Notes, partially offset by lower interest on the Senior Unsecured Notes, floor plan facility, and finance receivable facilities. 
 
 Other Expense (Income), Net 
 
 Other expense (income), net was an expense of 29 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and was primarily due to a 26 million decrease in the fair value of Root Warrants and a 4 million TRA expense, compared to an expense of 3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 which was primarily due to a 14 million TRA expense, partially offset by a 7 million increase in the fair value of our beneficial interests in securitizations and a 3 million increase in the fair value of Root Warrants. Other expense (income), net was an income of 23 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and was primarily due to a 27 million increase in the fair value of Root Warrants and a 15 million increase in the fair value of our beneficial interests in securitizations, partially offset by a 23 million TRA expense, compared to an income of 8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 which was primarily due to a 12 million increase in the fair value of our beneficial interests in securitizations and a 3 million increase in the fair value of Root Warrants, partially offset by a 14 million TRA expense. 
 
 Income Tax (Benefit) Provision 
 
 Income tax (benefit) provision changed by 30 million to a benefit of 1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a provision of 29 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Income tax (benefit) provision changed by 28 million to a benefit of 1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a provision of 27 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The changes were primarily due to the income tax expense related to the cancellation of debt income recognized on the exchange of 5.5 billion in principal of Senior Unsecured Notes for 4.2 billion in principal of Senior Secured Notes and 341 million in cash during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 To supplement the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we also present the following non-GAAP measures: Adjusted EBITDA; Adjusted EBITDA margin; Gross profit, non-GAAP; Total gross profit per retail unit, non-GAAP; SG A expenses, non-GAAP; and Total SG A expenses per retail unit, non-GAAP. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA; Adjusted EBITDA margin; Gross profit, non-GAAP; Total gross profit per retail unit, non-GAAP; SG A expenses, non-GAAP; and Total SG A expenses per retail unit, non-GAAP 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA; Adjusted EBITDA margin; Gross profit, non-GAAP; Total gross profit per retail unit, non-GAAP; SG A expenses, non-GAAP; and Total SG A expenses per retail unit, non-GAAP are supplemental measures of operating performance that do not represent and should not be considered an alternative to net income, gross profit, or SG A expenses, as determined by GAAP. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income plus income tax (benefit) provision, interest expense, other operating expense, net, other expense (income), net, depreciation and amortization expense in cost of sales and SG A expenses, share-based compensation expense in cost of sales and SG A expenses, loss on debt extinguishment, and restructuring expense in SG A 
 52 

expenses, minus revenue related to our Root Warrants and gain on debt extinguishment. Adjusted EBITDA margin is Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenues. 
 
 Gross profit, non-GAAP is defined as GAAP gross profit plus depreciation and amortization expense in cost of sales and share-based compensation expense in cost of sales, minus revenue related to our Root Warrants. Total gross profit per retail unit, non-GAAP is Gross profit, non-GAAP divided by retail vehicle unit sales. 
 
 SG A expenses, non-GAAP is defined as GAAP SG A expenses minus depreciation and amortization expense in SG A expenses, share-based compensation expense in SG A expenses, and restructuring expense in SG A expenses. Total SG A expenses per retail unit, non-GAAP is SG A expenses, non-GAAP divided by retail vehicle unit sales. 
 
 We use these non-GAAP measures to measure the operating performance of our business as a whole and relative to our total revenues and retail vehicle unit sales. We believe that these metrics are useful measures to us and to our investors because they exclude certain financial, capital structure, and non-cash items that we do not believe directly reflect our core operations and may not be indicative of our recurring operations, in part because they may vary widely across time and within our industry independent of the performance of our core operations. We believe that excluding these items enables us to more effectively evaluate our performance period-over-period and relative to our competitors. Adjusted EBITDA; Adjusted EBITDA margin; Gross profit, non-GAAP; Total gross profit per retail unit, non-GAAP; SG A expenses, non-GAAP; and Total SG A expenses per retail unit, non-GAAP may not be comparable to similarly titled measures provided by other companies due to potential differences in methods of calculations. 
 
 A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, Gross profit, non-GAAP to gross profit, and SG A expenses, non-GAAP to SG A expenses, which are the most directly comparable GAAP measures, and calculations of Adjusted EBITDA margin, Total gross profit per retail unit, non-GAAP, and Total SG A expenses per retail unit, non-GAAP is as follows:

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 General 
 
 We generate cash from the sale of retail vehicles, wholesale vehicles, loans we originate, and ancillary products such as VSCs and GAP waiver coverage. We generate additional cash flows through our financing activities including our short-term revolving inventory and finance receivable facilities and real estate and equipment financing, the issuance of long-term notes and new issuances of equity. Historically, cash generated from financing activities has funded growth and expansion into new markets and strategic initiatives and we expect this to continue in the future. 
 
 In response to the macroeconomic environment, our focus during previous quarters has been on driving profitability through initiatives to better conform our expense structure to unit volume levels. We expect to continue our focus on these profitability initiatives as we return to growth. We expect our primary sources of cash to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities for at least the next 12 months. 
 
 Our ability to service our debt and fund working capital, capital expenditures, and business development efforts in the long-term will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating and financing activities, which is subject to our future operating performance, as well as to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other conditions, some of which may be beyond our control. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our ability to refinance indebtedness, our ability to obtain supplemental liquidity through debt, equity, including the issuance of equity pursuant to our "at-the-market offering" program, strategic relationships or other arrangements on terms available or acceptable to us, our rate of revenue growth, our construction of IRCs and vending machines, the timing and extent of our spending to support our technology and software development efforts, our advertising spend, and increased population coverage. If we need to obtain supplemental liquidity, there can be no assurance that financing alternatives will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us in the future. 
 
 Finally, subject to the restrictions in the indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes, we or our affiliates have and may again, at any time, and from time to time, repurchase portions of our Class A common stock, our Senior Unsecured Notes, our Senior Secured Notes, or any other securities we may issue, from time to time, in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, in exchange for property or other securities or otherwise. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased and cancelled 100 million and 350 million of principal amount of 2028 Senior Secured Notes, respectively. Any additional repurchase decisions will be made after consideration of market conditions and liquidity needs and will be upon such terms and at such prices as we determine appropriate. However, there is no guarantee that a repurchase will take place. 
 
 Liquidity Resources 
 
 We had the following committed liquidity resources, secured debt capacity, and other unpledged assets available as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 
 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (in millions) Cash and cash equivalents 871 530 Availability under short-term revolving facilities (1) 
 1,522 1,006 Committed liquidity resources available 2,393 1,536 Super senior debt capacity 1,500 1,262 Pari passu senior debt capacity 425 250 Unpledged beneficial interests in securitizations 104 80 Total liquidity resources 4,422 3,128 
 
 (1) Based on pledging all eligible vehicles and finance receivables under the Floor Plan Facility and Finance Receivables Facilities, excluding the impact to restricted cash requirements. 
 
 55 

Our total liquidity resources are composed of cash and cash equivalents, availability under existing credit facilities, additional capacity under the indentures governing our Senior Secured Notes, which allow us to incur additional debt that can be senior or pari passu in lien priority as to the collateral securing the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes, and additional unpledged securities that can be financed using traditional asset-based financing sources. 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents includes cash deposits and highly liquid investment instruments with original maturities of three months or less, such as money market funds. 
 
 Availability under short-term revolving facilities is the available amount we can borrow under the Floor Plan Facility and Finance Receivable Facilities based on the pledgeable value of vehicle inventory and finance receivables on our balance sheet on the period end date. Availability under short-term revolving facilities is distinct from the total commitment amount of these facilities because it represents the currently borrowable amount, rather than committed future amounts that could be borrowed to finance future additional assets. Effective November 1, 2023, we amended our vehicle inventory Floor Plan Facility to resize the line of credit to 1.5 billion through April 30, 2025. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the short-term revolving facilities had a total commitment of 4.2 billion each, an outstanding balance of 76 million and 668 million, respectively, and unused capacity of 4.1 billion and 3.5 billion, respectively. 
 
 Super senior debt capacity and pari passu senior debt capacity represents basket capacity to incur additional debt that could be senior or pari passu in lien priority to the collateral securing the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes. The availability of such additional sources depends on many factors and there can be no assurance that financing alternatives will be available to us in the future. 
 
 Unpledged beneficial interests in securitizations includes retained beneficial interests in securitizations that have not been previously pledged or sold. We historically have financed the majority of our retained beneficial interests in securitizations and expect to continue to do so in the future. 
 
 Additionally, in January 2024, we amended our Master Purchase and Sale Agreement to, among other things, reestablish the commitment by the purchaser to purchase up to 4.0 billion of principal balances of finance receivables between January 11, 2024 and January 10, 2025. 
 
 To optimize our cost of capital, in any given period we may choose not to maximize borrowings on our short-term revolving facilities, maximize revolving commitment size, or immediately sale-leaseback real estate, and we may also choose to retain beneficial interests in securitizations for varying amounts of time. This has the benefit of reducing interest expense and debt issuance costs and providing flexibility to minimize financing costs over time. 
 
 We consider our total liquidity resources as an input into our planning. In general, changes in total liquidity resources fall into two broad categories: changes due to current business operations and changes due to investments in automotive retail assets. 
 
 Changes in liquidity due to current business operations include Adjusted EBITDA, non-real estate capital expenditures, including technology, furniture, fixtures, and equipment, and changes in traditional working capital, including accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other miscellaneous assets and liabilities. 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, we sponsor and engage in securitization transactions to sell our finance receivables to a diverse pool of investors. These securitizations involve unconsolidated variable interest entities in which we retain at least 5 of the credit risk of the underlying finance receivable by holding at least 5 of the notes and certificates issued by these entities. We are exposed to market risk in the securitization market. See Note 8 Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities, included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, for further discussion regarding our transactions with unconsolidated variable interest entities. 
 
 In addition we also invest in and generate several types of assets, including vehicle inventory, finance receivables, retained beneficial interests in securitizations, and real estate. To maximize capital efficiency, we generally seek to finance these assets with matched sources of asset-based financing, including short-term revolving facilities for vehicle inventory and finance receivables, beneficial interests financing for retained beneficial interests in securitizations, and sale-leaseback or other real estate financing for IRCs and vending machines. We have historically used these sources of financing to finance our investment in these assets and expect to continue to do so in the future.

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our outstanding principal amount of indebtedness was 5.5 billion and 6.0 billion, respectively, summarized in the table below. See Note 9 Debt Instruments included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information on our debt.

 (1) Includes 35 million and 185 million of accrued paid-in-kind ("PIK") interest as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Accrued PIK interest increases the principal amount of Senior Secured Notes on each semi-annual interest payment date. 
 (2) The unamortized debt issuance costs related to long-term debt are presented as a reduction of the carrying amount of the corresponding liabilities on the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. Unamortized debt issuance costs related to revolving debt arrangements are presented within other assets on the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets and not included here. 
 (3) The unamortized premium relates to a portion of the notes exchange offers completed in September 2023 which were accounted for as a debt modification. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 The following table presents a summary of our consolidated cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities 
 858 1,042 Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities 
 (6) 22 Net cash used in financing activities 
 (514) (1,076) Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 
 338 (12) Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of period 594 628 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period 932 616 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Our primary sources of operating cash flows result from the sales of retail vehicles, wholesale vehicles, loans we originate, and ancillary products. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are purchases of inventory, personnel-related expenses, and cash used to acquire customers. Cash provided by operating activities was 858 million and 1.0 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease in cash provided by operating activities of 184 
 57 

million, primarily due to increased vehicle inventory acquisitions and a lower ratio of finance receivables sold relative to originations of finance receivables, partially offset by a reduction in interest paid due to PIK interest on the Senior Secured Notes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Our primary use of cash for investing activities is purchases of property and equipment. Cash used in investing activities was 6 million and cash provided by investing activities was 22 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease in cash provided by investing activities of 28 million, primarily driven by lower proceeds received from the sale of property and equipment, partially offset by increased principal payments received on and proceeds from the sale of beneficial interests in securitizations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to our short and long-term debt activity, including proceeds from and payments on our short-term revolving facilities. Cash used in financing activities was 514 million and 1.1 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease in cash used in financing activities of 562 million, primarily driven by lower payments on short-term revolving facilities relative to borrowings, partially offset by lower net proceeds from the "at-the-market offering" program during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to the contractual obligations or commitments previously disclosed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed February 22, 2024.

 We report money market securities, certain receivables, the Root Warrants and beneficial interests in securitizations at fair value. See Note 17 Fair Value of Financial Instruments, included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which is incorporated into this item by reference.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 From time to time, we are involved in various claims, legal actions, and government inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business. Although the results of litigation, claims, and inquiries cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these actions will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. 
 
 Future litigation may be necessary to defend ourselves and our partners by determining the scope, enforceability and validity of third party proprietary rights or to establish our proprietary rights. The results of any current or future litigation or government inquiries cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, litigation and government inquiries can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.
