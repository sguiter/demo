 Amortization of discount on loans Amortization of premiums on loans ) ) Interest receivable charged-off, net of recoveries ) ) Total interest income 
 
 We accrue interest income using the effective interest method, which includes the amortization of any discounts or premiums on loan receivables created upon the purchase of a loan from our originating bank partners or upon the origination of a loan. Interest income on a loan is accrued daily, based on the finance charge disclosed to the consumer, over the term of the loan based upon the principal outstanding. The accrual of interest on a loan is suspended if a formal dispute with the consumer involving either Affirm or the merchant of record is opened, or a loan is days past due. Upon the resolution of a dispute with the consumer, the accrual of interest is resumed, and any interest that would have been earned during the disputed period is retroactively accrued. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the balance of loans held for investment on non-accrual status was million and million, respectively. 
 
 The account is charged-off in the period if the account becomes days past due or meets other charge-off policy requirements. Past due status is based on the contractual terms of the loans. Previously recognized interest receivable from charged-off loans that is accrued but not collected from the consumer is charged-off. 
 
 Gain on Sales of Loans 
 
 We sell certain loans we originate or purchase from our originating bank partners directly to third-party investors or to securitizations. We recognize a gain or loss on sale of loans sold to third parties or to unconsolidated securitizations by calculating the difference between the proceeds received and the carrying value of the loan. This amount is adjusted for the initial recognition of any assets or liabilities incurred upon sale. These generally include a net servicing asset or liability in connection with our ongoing obligation to continue to service the loans and a liability in connection with our loan repurchase obligation for loans that do not meet certain contractual requirements and such information about the loan was unknown at the time of sale.

 Loans held for investment includes loans originated through our originating bank partners and directly originated loans. The majority of the loans that are underwritten using our technology platform and originated by our originating bank partners are later purchased by us. We purchased loans from our originating bank partners in the amount of billion and billion during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We directly originated billion and billion of loans during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Our portfolio consists of interest bearing and non-interest bearing consumer loans with original term lengths of up to originated in markets including the U.S. and Canada, with the majority of loans originated within the U.S. Given that our loan portfolio focuses on one product segment, unsecured consumer installment loans, we generally evaluate the entire portfolio as a single homogeneous loan portfolio to predict future losses, considering factors such as country of origin, loan product, origination channel, merchant and various borrower characteristics. 
 
 We closely monitor credit quality for our loan receivables to manage and evaluate our related exposure to credit risk. Credit risk management begins with initial underwriting, where loan applications are assessed against the credit underwriting policy and procedures for our directly originated loans and originating bank partner loans, and continues through to full repayment of a loan. To assess a consumer who requests a loan, we use, among other indicators, internally developed risk models using detailed information from external sources, such as credit bureaus where available, and internal historical experience, including the consumer s prior repayment history on our platform as well as other measures. We combine these factors to establish a proprietary score as a credit quality indicator. 
 
 Our proprietary score ITACs is assigned to most loans facilitated through our technology platform, ranging from to , with representing the highest credit quality and therefore the lowest likelihood of loss.

 We maintain an allowance for credit losses at a level sufficient to absorb expected credit losses based on evaluating known and inherent risks in our loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses reflects our estimate of expected lifetime credit losses, which consider the remaining contractual term, historical credit losses, consumer payment trends, estimated recoveries, and future payment expectations as of each balance sheet date. Adjustments to the allowance for changes in our estimate of lifetime expected credit losses are recognized in earnings through the provision for credit losses presented on our interim condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. When available information confirms that specific loans or portions thereof are uncollectible, identified amounts are charged off against the allowance for credit losses. Loans are charged off in accordance with our charge-off policy, as the contractual principal becomes days past due. Subsequent recoveries of the unpaid principal balance, if any, are credited to the allowance for credit losses.

 Loan Modifications for Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty 
 
 We have a loan modification program for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty if certain eligibility criteria are met. A loan is evaluated for modification program eligibility when a borrower self-reports financial hardship, either when a borrower contacts us directly or upon making contact with the borrower to determine eligibility when a loan payment is past due. The objectives of the loan modification program are to offer borrowers assistance during times of financial stress, increase collections, and minimize losses. 
 
 We have two primary loan modification strategies: payment deferrals and loan re-amortization. A payment deferral provides the borrower relief by extending the due date for the next payment due. While a borrower may obtain more than deferral, the total deferral period may not exceed . A loan re-amortization provides the borrower relief by lowering monthly payments through extending the term length of the loan; however, the total remaining term may not exceed . In addition, the total interest due from the consumer will not exceed the initial total interest due prior to modification, and a loan may not be re-amortized more than once. 

Loan re-amortization Total of total loan receivables outstanding 
 
 (1) Amounts previously disclosed excluded modifications made to borrowers where the loan was less than 30 days delinquent at the time of modification. 
 
 With respect to borrowers who received payment deferrals during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the length of each deferral period was . 
 
 With respect to borrowers who received a loan re-amortization during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the payment amount was reduced by half and the term of the loan was extended between and . 
 
 During the modification process, the loans are made current, and payment schedules for these loans are updated according to the modified terms. We closely monitor the performance of loans that are modified for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty to understand the effectiveness of our modification efforts. We hold an

 Legal Proceedings 
 
 From time to time, we are subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. The results of such matters often cannot be predicted with certainty.

 Kusnier v. Affirm Holdings, Inc. 
 
 On December 8, 2022, plaintiff Mark Kusnier filed a putative class action lawsuit against Affirm, Max Levchin, and Michael Linford in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the Kusnier action ). On May 5, 2023, plaintiffs Kusnier and Chris Meinsen filed their first amended complaint alleging that the defendants (i) caused Affirm to make materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that Affirm s BNPL service facilitated excessive consumer debt (including with respect to certain for-profit educational institutions), regulatory arbitrage, and data harvesting; (ii) made false and/or misleading statements about certain public regulatory actions; and (iii) made false and/or misleading statements about whether Affirm s business model was vulnerable to interest rate changes. On December 20, 2023, the Court granted Affirm s motion to dismiss the first amended complaint with leave to amend. On January 19, 2024, plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint, which contains only the allegations from the first amended complaint relating to false and/or misleading statements about whether Affirm s business model was vulnerable to interest rate changes. In light of the above, plaintiffs assert that Affirm violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and that Levchin and Linford violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Plaintiffs seek class certification, unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, and costs and expenses. Affirm filed its motion to dismiss the second amended complaint on February 2, 2024. On August 26, 2024, the Court granted Affirm s motion to dismiss with leave to amend. On September 23, 2024, plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file a motion for reconsideration of the Court's Order granting Affirm's motion to dismiss. 
 
 Quiroga v. Levchin, et al. 
 
 On March 29, 2023, plaintiff John Quiroga filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the Quiroga action against Affirm, as a nominal defendant, and certain of Affirm s current officers and directors as defendants based on allegations substantially similar to those in the Kusnier action at the time of filing. The Quiroga complaint purports to assert claims on Affirm s behalf for contribution under the federal securities laws, breaches of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and waste of corporate assets, and seeks corporate reforms, unspecified damages and restitution, and fees and costs. On May 1, 2023, the action was stayed by agreement of the parties. The stay can be lifted at the request of either party or upon certain conditions relating to the resolution of the Kusnier action.

Table of Contents 

In the U.S., through trusts, we have entered into warehouse credit facilities with certain lenders to finance the purchase and origination of our loans. Each trust entered into a credit agreement and security agreement with a third-party as administrative agent and a national banking association as collateral trustee and paying agent. Borrowings under these agreements are classified as funding debt in the interim condensed consolidated balance sheets and proceeds from the borrowings can only be used for the purposes of facilitating loan funding and origination. These warehouse credit facility trusts, which have been classified as VIEs, are bankruptcy-remote special-purpose vehicles in which creditors do not have recourse against the general credit of Affirm. Additionally, we have various credit facilities utilized to finance the origination of loan receivables in Canada. Similar to our warehouse credit facilities in the U.S., borrowings under these agreements are classified as funding debt in the interim condensed consolidated balance sheets, and proceeds from the borrowings may only be used for the purposes of facilitating loan funding and origination. 
 
 Financing terms, including the advance rate and financing spread, vary across these revolving facilities and generally depend on the types of collateral that may be pledged and respective concentration limits. The revolving period for each facility generally ends - months prior to the final maturity date, after which additional borrowings are not permitted. 
 
 Our funding debt agreements contain certain customary negative covenants and financial covenants including maintaining certain levels of minimum liquidity, maximum leverage, and minimum tangible net worth. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants in the agreements.

 Sales and Repurchase Agreements 
 
 We entered into certain sale and repurchase agreements pursuant to our retained interests in our off-balance sheet securitizations where we have sold these securities to a counterparty with an obligation to repurchase at a future date and price. The repurchase agreements each have an initial term of and subject to mutual agreement by Affirm and the counterparty, we may enter into or more repurchase date extensions, each for an additional term or as mutually agreed upon with the counterparty at market interest rates on such extension date. As of September 30, 2024, the interest rates were for both the senior pledged securities and the residual certificate pledged securities. We had million and million in debt outstanding under our repurchase agreements classified within funding debt in the interim condensed consolidated balance sheets as of

 Convertible Senior Notes 
 
 On November 23, 2021, we issued million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2026 (the 2026 Notes in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The total net proceeds from this offering, after deducting debt issuance costs, were approximately million. The 2026 Notes represent our senior unsecured obligations of the Company. The 2026 Notes do not bear interest except in special circumstances described below, and the principal amount of the 2026 Notes does not accrete. The 2026 Notes mature on November 15, 2026. 
 
 Each 1,000 of principal of the 2026 Notes will initially be convertible into 4.6371 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events set forth in the indenture governing the 2026 Notes (the Indenture ). Holders of the 2026 Notes may convert their 2026 Notes at their option at any time on or after August 15, 2026 until close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of November 15, 2026. Further, holders of the 2026 Notes may convert all or any portion of their 2026 Notes at their option prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding August 15, 2026, only under the following circumstances: 
 
 1) during any calendar quarter commencing after March 31, 2022 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Class A common stock for at least trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; 
 
 2) during the five business day period after any consecutive trading day period (the measurement period) in which the trading price (as defined in the indenture governing the 2026 Notes) per 1,000 principal amount of the 2026 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company s Class A common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; 
 
 3) if the Company calls any or all of the notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or 
 
 4) upon the occurrence of certain specified corporate events. 
 
 Upon conversion of the 2026 Notes, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at the Company s election. If we satisfy our conversion obligation solely in cash or through payment and delivery, as the case may be, of a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, the amount of cash and shares of common stock, if any, due upon conversion will be based on a daily conversion value (as set forth in the Indenture) calculated on a proportionate basis for each trading day in a trading day observation period. 
 
 No sinking fund is provided for the 2026 Notes. We may not redeem the notes prior to November 20, 2024. We may redeem for cash all or part of the notes on or after November 20, 2024 if the last reported sale price of our Class A common stock has been at least of the conversion price then in effect for at least trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of

 of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any. 
 
 If a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture) occurs prior to the maturity date, holders of the 2026 Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date. In addition, if specific corporate events occur prior to the maturity date of the 2026 Notes, we will be required to increase the conversion rate for holders who elect to convert their 2026 Notes in connection with such corporate events. 
 
 On December 6, 2023, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to million in aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes. This authorization succeeds the million repurchase authorization approved by the Board of Directors on June 7, 2023. Note repurchases under the December 2023 authorization may be made from time to time through December 31, 2024 through open market purchases, privately negotiated purchases, purchase plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Rule 10b5-1 ), or through a combination thereof. Repurchases are subject to available liquidity, general market and economic conditions, alternate uses for the capital, and other factors, and there is no minimum principal amount of 2026 Notes that the Company is obligated to repurchase. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we paid million in cash for the repurchase of million aggregate principal amount of our 2026 Notes under the December 2023 authorization. The carrying amount of the extinguished 2026 Notes was approximately million resulting in a million gain on early extinguishment of debt for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which is reported as a component of other income, net within our interim consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The repurchased 2026 Notes were received and canceled. 
 
 ) 
 
 The 2026 Notes do not bear interest. We recognized million and million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, of interest expense related to the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs in the interim condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss within other income, net. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining life of the 2026 Notes is approximately months. 
 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 
 On June 26, 2024, we entered into an amendment to our Revolving Credit Agreement, where we increased the unsecured revolving commitments under the facility from million to million. This facility bears interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (a) a SOFR rate determined by reference to the forward-looking term SOFR rate for the interest period, plus an applicable margin of per annum or (b) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus per annum, (ii) the rate last quoted by the Wall Street Journal as the U.S. prime rate and (iii) the one-month forward-looking term SOFR rate plus per annum, in each case, plus an applicable margin of per annum. Under the terms of amendment the final maturity date was extended from February 4, 2025 to June 26, 2027. The facility contains certain financial covenants which may result in an acceleration of the maturity if not maintained, and requires payment of a monthly unused commitment fee of per annum on the undrawn balance available. As of September 30, 2024, there are borrowings outstanding under the facility.

 As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, we serviced loans which we sold with a remaining unpaid principal balance of billion and billion, respectively. 
 
 We use discounted cash flow models to arrive at an estimate of fair value. Significant assumptions used in the valuation of our servicing rights are as follows: 
 
 Adequate Compensation 
 
 We estimate adequate compensation as the rate a willing market participant would require for servicing loans with similar characteristics as those in the serviced portfolio. 
 
 Discount Rate 
 
 Estimated future payments to be received under servicing agreements are discounted as a part of determining the fair value of the servicing rights. For servicing rights on loans, the discount rate reflects the time value of money and a risk premium intended to reflect the amount of compensation market participants would require. 
 
 Gross Default Rate 
 
 We estimate the timing and probability of early loan payoffs, loan defaults and write-offs, thus affecting the projected unpaid principal balance and expected term of the loan, which are used to project future servicing revenue and expenses. 
 
 We earned million and million of servicing income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the aggregate fair value of the servicing assets was measured at million and million, respectively, and presented within other assets in the interim condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the aggregate fair value of the servicing liabilities was measured at million and million, respectively, and presented within accrued expenses and other liabilities in the interim condensed consolidated balance sheets.

 Performance Fee Liability 
 
 In accordance with our agreements with our originating bank partners, we pay a fee for each loan that is fully repaid by the consumer, due at the end of the period in which the loan is fully repaid. We recognize a liability upon the purchase of a loan for the expected future payment of the performance fee. This liability is measured using a discounted cash flow model and recorded at fair value and presented within accrued expenses and other liabilities in the interim condensed consolidated balance sheets.

 As of September 30, 2024, we held notes receivable and residual trust certificates with an aggregate fair value of million in connection with unconsolidated securitizations. The balances correspond to the economic risk retention we are required to maintain as the securitization sponsor. 
 
 These assets are measured at fair value using a discounted cash flow model, and presented within securities available for sale at fair value in the interim condensed consolidated balance sheets.

Upon capture of a loan under this program, we record a liability associated with the estimated future profit to be shared over the life of the loan based on estimated program profitability levels. This liability is measured using a discounted cash flow model and recorded at fair value and presented within accrued expenses and other liabilities in the interim condensed consolidated balance sheets.

 Risk Sharing Arrangements 
 
 In connection with certain capital funding arrangements with third party loan buyers, we have entered into risk sharing agreements where we may be required to make a payment to the loan buyer or are entitled to receive a payment from the loan buyer, depending on the actual versus expected loan performance as contractually agreed to with the counterparty, and subject to a cap based on a percentage of the principal balance of loans sold. Loan performance is evaluated at a cohort level based on the month loans were sold. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, we have sold billion and billion, respectively, unpaid principal balance of loans under these risk sharing arrangements, of which our maximum exposure to losses is million and million, respectively. This amount includes our maximum potential loss with respect to risk sharing liabilities of million and the fair value of risk sharing assets of million, as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 We account for these arrangements as derivatives measured at fair value with gains and losses recognized in Gain on sale of loans in our interim condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. For each counterparty, we have recognized a net asset or net liability based on the estimated fair value of future payments we expect to receive from or make to the counterparty. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, we held assets related to these arrangements of million and million, respectively, and liabilities of million and million, respectively.

 2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
 
 On November 18, 2020, our Board of Directors adopted and approved the 2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP ). The purpose of the ESPP is to secure the services of new employees, to retain the services of existing employees and to provide incentives for such individuals to exert maximum effort towards the success of the Company and that of its affiliates. A total of million shares of Class A common stock are reserved and available for issuance under the ESPP and million shares have been issued as of September 30, 2024. The ESPP provides for offering periods beginning December 1 and June 1 of each year. At the end of each offering period, shares of our Class A common stock are purchased on behalf of each ESPP participant at a price per share equal to of the lesser of (1) the fair market value of the Class A common stock on first day of the offering period (the grant date) or (2) the fair market value of the Class A common stock on the last day of the offering period (the purchase date). We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to measure the fair value of the purchase rights issued under the ESPP at the first day of the offering period, which represents the grant date. We record stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over each offering period, the requisite service period of the award.

 Item 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the interim condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q Form 10-Q and our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes and the discussion under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis, including information with respect to our planned investments to drive future growth, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the sections titled Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors of this Form 10-Q and our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of forward-looking statements and important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. 
 
 Overview 
 
 We are building the next generation payment network. We believe that by using modern technology, strong engineering talent, and a mission-driven approach, we can reinvent payments and commerce. Our solutions, which are built on trust and transparency, are designed to make it easier for consumers to spend responsibly and with confidence, easier for merchants and commerce platforms to convert sales and grow, and easier for commerce to thrive. 
 Our point-of-sale solutions allow consumers to pay for purchases in fixed amounts without deferred interest, late fees, or penalties. We empower consumers to pay over time rather than paying for a purchase entirely upfront. This increases consumers purchasing power and gives them more control and flexibility. Our platform facilitates both true 0 APR payment options and interest-bearing loans. On the merchant side, we offer commerce enablement, demand generation, and consumer acquisition tools. Our solutions empower merchants to more efficiently promote and sell their products, optimize their consumer acquisition strategies, and drive incremental sales. We also provide valuable product-level data and insights information that merchants cannot easily get elsewhere to better inform their strategies. Finally, for consumers, our app unlocks the full suite of Affirm products for a delightful end-to-end consumer experience. Consumers can use our app to apply for installment loans, and upon approval, they can use the Affirm Card digitally online or in-stores to complete a purchase. Additionally, consumers can manage the pre and post purchase split of Affirm Card transactions into loan, manage payments, open a high-yield savings account, and access a personalized marketplace. 
 Our Company is predicated on the principles of simplicity, transparency, and putting people first. By adhering to these principles, we have built enduring, trust-based relationships with consumers and merchants that we believe will set us up for long-term, sustainable success. We believe our innovative approach uniquely positions us to define the future of commerce and payments. 
 Technology and data are at the core of everything we do. Our expertise in sourcing, aggregating, and analyzing data has been what we believe to be the key competitive advantage of our platform since our founding. We believe our proprietary technology platform and data give us a unique advantage in pricing risk. We use data to inform our risk scoring in order to generate value for our consumers, merchants, and capital partners. We also prioritize building our own technology and investing in product and engineering talent as we believe these are enduring competitive advantages that are difficult to replicate. Our solutions use the latest in machine learning, artificial intelligence, cloud-based technologies, and other modern tools to create differentiated and scalable products.

 Our Financial Model 
 
 Our Revenue Model 
 We have three main loan product offerings: Pay-in-X, 0 annual percentage rate APR monthly installment loans and interest-bearing monthly installment loans. Pay-in-X consists of short-term payment plans with one to four 0 APR installments. 
 From merchants, we typically earn a fee when we help them convert a sale and facilitate a transaction. Merchant fees depend on the individual arrangement between us and each merchant and vary based on the terms of the product offering; we generally earn larger merchant fees on 0 APR financing products. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Pay-in-X represented 14 and 15 , respectively, of total GMV facilitated through our platform while 0 APR installment loans represented 11 for both periods. 
 From consumers, we earn interest income on the simple interest loans that we originate or purchase from our originating bank partners. Interest rates charged to our consumers vary depending on the transaction risk, creditworthiness of the consumer, the repayment term selected by the consumer, the amount of the loan, and the individual arrangement with a merchant. Because our consumers are never charged deferred or compounding interest, late fees, or penalties on the loans, we are not incentivized to profit from our consumers hardships. In addition, interest income includes the amortization of any discounts or premiums on loan receivables created upon either the purchase of a loan from one of our originating bank partners or our direct origination of a loan. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, interest bearing loans represented 75 and 74 , respectively, of total GMV facilitated through our platform. 
 In order to accelerate our ubiquity, we facilitate the issuance of virtual cards directly to consumers through our app, allowing them to shop with merchants that may not yet be fully integrated with Affirm. Similarly, we also facilitate the issuance of the Affirm Card, a card that can be used physically or virtually and which allows consumers to link a bank account to pay in full, or pay later by accessing credit through the Affirm App. When these cards are used over established card networks, we earn a portion of the interchange fee from the transaction. 
 Our Loan Origination and Servicing Model 
 When a consumer applies for a loan through our platform, the loan is underwritten using our proprietary risk model. Once approved for the loan, the consumer then selects their preferred repayment option. A portion of these loans are funded and issued by our originating bank partners, which include Cross River Bank, an FDIC-insured New Jersey state-chartered bank, Celtic Bank, an FDIC-insured Utah state-chartered industrial bank, and Lead Bank, an FDIC-insured Missouri state-chartered bank. These partnerships allow us to benefit from our partners ability to originate loans under their banking licenses while complying with various federal, state, and other laws. Under this arrangement, we must comply with our originating bank partners' credit policies and underwriting procedures, and our originating bank partners maintain ultimate authority to decide whether to originate a loan or not. When an originating bank partner originates a loan, it funds the loan through its own funding sources and may subsequently offer and sell the loan to us. Pursuant to our agreements with these partners, we are 
 54 

Table of Contents 

 obligated to purchase the loans facilitated through our platform that such partner offers us and our obligation is secured by cash deposits. To date, we have purchased all of the loans facilitated through our platform and originated by our originating bank partners. When we purchase a loan from an originating bank partner, the purchase price is equal to the outstanding principal balance of the loan, plus a fee and any accrued interest. The originating bank partner also retains an interest in the loans purchased by us through a loan performance fee that is payable by us on the aggregate principal amount of a loan that is paid by a consumer. Refer to Note 12. Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities in the notes to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on the performance fee liability. 
 
 We are also able to originate loans directly under our lending, servicing, and brokering licenses in Canada and across several states in the U.S. through our consolidated subsidiaries. We directly originated approxi mately 1.3 billion, or 17 , and 0.9 billion, or 17 , of loans f or the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 We act as the servicer on all loans that we originate directly or purchase from our originating bank partners and earn a servicing fee on loans held by third parties, including bank partners prior to loan purchase and third party loan buyers if subsequently sold as part of our funding strategy. In the normal course of business, we do not sell the servicing rights on any of the loans. To allow for flexible staffing to support overflow and seasonal traffic, we partner with several sub-servicers to manage consumer care, first priority collections, and third-party collections in accordance with our policies and procedures. 
 
 Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 Our performance has been and may continue to be affected by many factors, including those identified below, as well as the factors discussed in the section titled Risk Factors in this Form 10-Q and in our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. 
 Expanding our Network, Diversity, and Mix of Funding Relationships 
 Our capital efficient funding model is integral to the success of our platform. As we scale the number of transactions on our network and grow GMV, we maintain a variety of funding relationships in order to support our network. Our diversified funding relationships include warehouse facilities, securitization trusts, forward flow arrangements, and partnerships with banks. Given the short duration and strong performance of our assets, funding can be recycled quickly, resulting in a high-velocity, capital efficient funding model. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, our equity capital as a percentage of our total platform portfolio has remained relatively unchanged at 5 . The mix of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet funding is a function of how we choose to allocate loan volume, which is determined by the economic arrangements and supply of capital available to us, both of which may also impact our results in any given period. 
 Mix of Business on Our Platform 
 The shifts in merchant volumes and products offered in any period affect our operating results. These shifts impact GMV, revenue, our financial results, and our key operating metric performance for that period. Differences in loan product mix result in varying loan durations, APR, and mix of 0 APR and interest-bearing financings. 
 Product and economic terms of commercial agreements vary among our merchants, which may impact our results. For example, our low average order value AOV products generally benefit from shorter duration, but also have lower revenue as a percentage of GMV when compared to high AOV products. Merchant mix shifts are driven in part by the products offered by the merchant, the economic terms negotiated with the merchant, merchant-side activity relating to the marketing of their products, whether or not the merchant is fully integrated within our network, and general economic conditions affecting consumer demand. Our revenue as a percentage of GMV in any given period varies across products. As such, as we continue to expand our network to include more merchants and product offerings, revenue as a percentage of GMV may vary. 
 55 

Table of Contents 

 Additionally, our commercial agreements with our platform partners, the expansion of our consumer eligibility criteria, along with the growing repeat usage of our Affirm Card offerings, are driving an increase in low AOV transactions. As a result, while we expect that transactions per active consumer may increase, revenue as a percentage of GMV may decline in the medium term to the extent that a greater portion of our GMV comes from Affirm Card and other low-AOV offerings. 
 Seasonality 
 We experience seasonal fluctuations in our business as a result of consumer spending patterns, including Affirm Card, which we expect to mimic the seasonality of our general business in the near term. Historically, our GMV has been the strongest during our fiscal second quarter due to increases in retail commerce during the holiday season and our loan delinquencies are at their lowest during our fiscal third and fourth quarter, as consumer savings benefit from tax refunds. Adverse events that occur during our second fiscal quarter could have a disproportionate effect on our financial results for the fiscal year. 
 Macroeconomic Environment 
 We regularly monitor the direct and indirect impacts of the current macroeconomic conditions on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Starting in fiscal 2023, the macroeconomic environment began to present a number of challenges to our business. In response to continued inflationary pressure, the U.S. Federal Reserve rapidly raised the federal funds interest rate from March 2022 through July 2023. Despite the Federal Reserve s decision to decrease the federal funds interest rate in September 2024, uncertainty remains as to whether and to what extent the federal funds interest rate will remain at current levels, increase or decrease in future periods. Simultaneously, economic uncertainty and the prospect of economic recession has impacted consumer spending. These challenges have affected, and may continue to affect, our business and results of operations in the following ways: 
 Shifts in consumer demand: Over the past two fiscal years, we have experienced varying levels of consumer demand across different categories of merchandise. While all merchandise categories except for Sporting Goods and Outdoors grew year-over-year, economic uncertainty, inflationary pressures and elevated interest rates remain. If macroeconomic conditions deteriorate in future periods, consumer demand may be negatively impacted. 
 
 Increased borrowing costs: Our borrowing costs have remained elevated due to the interest rate environment, resulting in sustained higher transaction costs. Despite the Federal Reserve decreasing the federal funds interest rate in September 2024, the interest rate environment remains elevated and, as a result, we may continue to experience higher transaction costs. 
 
 Volatile capital markets: Since fiscal 2024, capital markets have shown improvement against recent periods, which has been evidenced by substantial additions across our funding channels due to our strong loan performance. However, despite these improvements, uncertainties remain in the macroeconomic environment, especially with regard to inflation and the potential for increased unemployment. To address these uncertainties, we leverage our diverse funding channels and counterparties, which contribute to our resilience across various macroeconomic conditions and economic cycles. 
 
 Consumer Credit Optimization and Loan Performance 
 
 We continue to optimize our underwriting and take other actions to manage consumer loan repayment, increase collections and minimize losses. For example, we offer loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty to provide greater flexibility for consumers to repay their obligations, through payment deferrals or loan re-amortizations. A payment deferral extends the next payment due date, and while a consumer may receive more than one deferral, the total deferral period may not exceed three months. A loan re-amortization lowers the monthly payments by extending the term, which may not exceed twenty-four months. 
 
 56 

Table of Contents 

 These loan modification programs also impact our delinquency rates, and such impact can vary over time. As disclosed in Note 4. Loans Held for Investment and Allowance for Credit Losses in the notes to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements, in fiscal 2024, we expanded the eligibility of our loan modification programs, which resulted in a modest benefit to delinquency rates for loans held for investment during that period. While the volume of loan modifications decreased during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 relative to the prior fiscal quarter, they remain elevated when compared to the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. Loans modified within the last three and twelve months represent 0.18 and 0.42 , respectively, of the outstanding principal balance of loans held on our balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. Our reported delinquency and charge off rates include loans which have become past due or have charged off subsequent to modification. An unknown percentage of loans which have been modified and are current as of September 30, 2024 may become delinquent or charge off in the future. We continue to evaluate the effectiveness of these programs and may modify, expand, or contract their usage, which may affect the timing of reported delinquencies and charge offs in future periods. 
 
 Regulatory Developments 
 
 We are subject to the regulatory and enforcement authority of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the CFPB as a facilitator, servicer, acquirer or originator of consumer credit. As such, the CFPB has in the past requested reports concerning our organization, business conduct, markets, and activities, and we expect that the CFPB will continue to do so from time to time in the future. In addition, we are supervised by the CFPB, which enables it, among other things, to conduct comprehensive and rigorous examinations to assess our compliance with consumer financial protection laws, which in turn could result in matters requiring attention, enforcement investigations and actions, regulatory fines and mandated changes to our business products, policies and procedures. 
 
 Key Operating Metrics 
 
 We focus on several key operating metrics to measure the performance of our business and help determine our strategic direction. In addition to revenue, net loss, and other results under U.S. GAAP, the following tables set forth key operating metrics we use to evaluate our business. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change (in billions) GMV 7.6 5.6 35 
 GMV 
 We measure GMV to assess the volume of transactions that take place on our platform. We define GMV as the total dollar amount of all transactions on the Affirm platform during the applicable period, net of refunds. GMV does not represent revenue earned by us; however, it is an indicator of the success of our merchants and the strength of our platform. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, GMV was 7.6 billion which represented an increase of approximately 35 as compared to the same period in 2023. Overall, the increase in GMV was driven by an increase in volume at our top five merchants and platform partners as well as overall increases in our active merchant base, active consumers and average transactions per consumer. The increase in GMV for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was diversified across categories and products. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, growth was primarily attributable to an increase in the general and merchandise categories. Additionally, consumer demand across our travel and ticketing, electronics, and equipment and auto categories grew more than 20 year over year. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our top five merchants and platform partners represented approximately 47 of total GMV, as compared to 42 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. GMV attributable to Amazon during the three months ended September 30, 2024 represented 23 of total GMV. GMV attributable to Amazon during the three months ended September 30, 2023 represented less than 20 of total GMV.

 Active Consumers 
 We assess consumer adoption and engagement by the number of active consumers across our platform. Active consumers are the primary measure of the size of our network. We define an active consumer as a consumer who completes at least one transaction on our platform during the 12 months prior to the measurement date. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 19.5 million active consumers, which represented an increase of 15 compared to approximately 16.9 million active consumers as of September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a high retention rate of existing consumers and the acquisition of new consumers through an expansion in active merchants and platform partnerships as well as continued adoption of the Affirm Card. 
 Transactions per Active Consumer 
 We believe the value of our network is amplified with greater consumer engagement and repeat usage, highlighted by increased transactions per active consumer. Transactions per active consumer is defined as the average number of transactions that an active consumer has conducted on our platform during the 12 months prior to the measurement date. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 5.1 transactions per active consumer, an increase of 25 compared to September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to platform growth, a higher frequency of repeat users driven by consumer engagement and growth of Affirm Card active consumers. As of September 30, 2024, Affirm Card represented approximately 11 of the total number of transactions compared to approximately 6 as of September 30, 2023.

(1) Upon purchase of a loan from our originating bank partners at a price above the fair market value of the loan or upon the origination of a loan with a par value in excess of the fair market value of the loan, a discount is included in the amortized cost basis of the loan. For loans held for investment, this discount is amortized over the life of the loan into interest income. When a loan is sold to a third-party loan buyer or off-balance sheet securitization trust, the unamortized discount is released in full at the time of sale and recognized as part of the gain or loss on sales of loans. However, the cumulative value of the loss on loan purchase commitment or loss on origination, the interest income recognized over time from the amortization of discount while retained, and the release of discount into gain on sales of loans, together net to zero over the life of the loan. The following table details activity for the discount, included in loans held for investment, for the periods indicated:

 Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Merchant network revenue 
 Merchant network revenue is impacted by both GMV and the mix of loans originated on our platform as merchant fees vary based on loan characteristics. In particular, merchant network revenue as a percentage of GMV typically increases with longer-term, non interest-bearing loans with higher AOVs, and decreases with shorter-term, interest-bearing loans with lower AOVs. 
 Merchant network revenue increased by 38.4 million, or 26 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily attributed to an increase of 2.0 billion, or 35 , in GMV for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in GMV is a result of continued growth at our top five merchants and platform partners representing approximately 47 and 42 as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our active merchant base and the number of active consumers also grew, reaching approximately 323 thousand and 19.5 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2024, up from approximately 266 thousand and 16.9 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2023. 
 With respect to the frequency and mix of transactions, the transactions per active consumer increased from 4.1 as of September 30, 2023 to 5.1 as of September 30, 2024, however AOV decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 299 to 279 as compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in AOV is driven by an increase in GMV in the general and merchandise categories, which tend to have a lower AOV, and our ongoing initiative to drive repeat usage of our platform beyond one-time high AOV purchases. 
 Card network revenue 
 Card network revenue increased by 14.0 million, or 42 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Card network revenue growth is correlated with the growth of GMV processed by our card-issuing partners. As such, the increase is primarily driven by 2.5 billion of GMV processed 
 60 

Table of Contents 

 through our card-issuing partners, an increase of 38 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. This was driven by increased card activity primarily through our single use virtual cards and Affirm Card, as well as growth in existing and new merchants utilizing our agreement with card-issuing partners as a means of integrating Affirm services, which grew from approximately 1,400 merchants as of September 30, 2023 to 4,700 merchants as of September 30, 2024. Card network revenue is also impacted by the mix of merchants as different merchants can have different interchange rates depending on their industry or size, among other factors. 
 Interest income 
 Interest income increased by 114.4 million, or 44 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. Generally, interest income is correlated with the changes in the average balance of loans held for investment, which increased by 34 to 6.0 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. As a result, interest income from interest-bearing loans increased by 111.0 million, or 49 , compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Gain on sales of loans 
 Gain on sales of loans increased by 29.3 million, or 86 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase is driven by factors including higher loan sale volume to third-party loan buyers and favorable transaction economics which are impacted by the composition of our loan portfolio sold, investor demand for our product, and other market factors. We sold loans with an unpaid principal balance of 2.8 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.2 billion for the same period in 2023. 
 Servicing income 
 Servicing income includes net servicing fee revenue and fair value adjustments for servicing assets and liabilities, and is recognized for loan portfolios sold to third-party loan buyers and for loans held within our off-balance sheet securitizations. Servicing fee revenue varies by contractual servicing fee arrangement and is earned as a percentage of the average unpaid principal balance of loans held by each counterparty where we have a servicing agreement. We reduce servicing income for certain fees we are required to pay per our contractual servicing arrangement. 
 With respect to fair value adjustments, we remeasure the fair value of servicing assets and liabilities each period and recognize the change in fair value in servicing income. We utilize a discounted cash flow approach to remeasure the fair value of servicing rights. Because we earn servicing income based on the outstanding principal balance of the portfolio, fair value adjustments are impacted by the timing and amount of loan repayments. As such, over the term of each loan portfolio sold, fair value adjustments for servicing assets will decrease servicing income and fair value adjustments for servicing liabilities will increase servicing income. We discuss our valuation methodology and significant Level 3 inputs for servicing assets and liabilities within Note 12. Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities in the notes to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Servicing income increased by 5.8 million, or 29 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily due to an increase in net servicing fee revenue which is calculated as a percentage of the unpaid principal balance of off-balance sheet loans. The average unpaid principal balance of off-balance sheet loans increased from 4.4 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 5.4 billion during the same period in 2024, an increase of 23 .

 Loss on loan purchase commitment 
 We purchase certain loans from our originating bank partners that are processed through our platform and put back to us by our originating bank partners. Under the terms of the agreements with our originating bank partners, we are generally required to pay the principal amount plus accrued interest for such loans and fees. In certain instances, our originating bank partners may originate loans with zero or below market interest rates that we are required to purchase. In these instances, we may be required to purchase the loan for a price in excess of the fair market value of such loans, which results in a loss. These losses are recognized as loss on loan purchase commitment in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. These costs are incurred on a per loan basis. 
 Loss on loan purchase commitment increased by 19.4 million, or 56 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to an increase in total volume of loans purchased. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we purchased 6.4 billion of loans from our originating bank partners, compared to 4.6 billion in the same period in 2023, representing an increase of 40 . 
 Provision for credit losses 
 Provision for credit losses generally represents the amount of expense required to maintain the allowance for credit losses on our interim condensed consolidated balance sheet, which represents management s estimate of future losses. In the event that our loans outperform expectation and/or we reduce our expectation of credit losses in future periods, we may release reserves and thereby reduce the allowance for credit losses, yielding income in the provision for credit losses. The provision is determined based on our estimate of expected future losses on loans originated during the period and held for investment on our balance sheet, changes in our estimate of future losses on loans outstanding as of the end of the period and the net charge-offs incurred in the period. 
 Provision for credit losses increased by 60.1 million, or 60 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily driven by growth in the volume of loans held for investment. Loans held for investment as of September 30, 2024 was 6.3 billion, an increase of 1.8 billion, or 39 , as compared to the same period in 2023. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans held for investment increased from 5.1 as of September 30, 2023 to 5.6 as of September 30, 2024. The increase in the allowance rate from September 30, 2023 is primarily driven by an increase in loans held on our balance sheet as well as adjustments in our credit criteria in light of increasing interest income generated by our loans and changes in the loan mix. 
 Funding costs 
 Funding costs consist of interest expense and the amortization of fees for certain borrowings collateralized by our loans including warehouse credit facilities and consolidated securitizations, sale and repurchase agreements collateralized by our retained securitization interests, and other costs incurred in connection with funding the purchases and originations of loans. Funding costs for a given period are driven by the average outstanding balance of funding debt and notes issued by securitization trusts as well as our contractual interest rate and distribution of loans across funding facilities, net of the impact of any designated cash flow hedges. 
 Funding costs increased by 30.2 million, or 41 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily due to an increase of funding debt and notes issued by securitization trusts during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The average total of funding debt from warehouses and securitizations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 5.4 billion compared to 4.0 billion during the same period in 2023, an increase of 1.4 billion, or 34 . The increase was also attributable to a larger volume of on-balance sheet loans being retained during the period. The average on-balance sheet loan balance was 6.0 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 34 compared to 4.5 billion during the same period in 2023.

 Processing and servicing 
 
 Processing and servicing expense consists primarily of payment processing fees, third-party customer support and collection expense, salaries and personnel-related costs of our customer care team, platform fees, and allocated overhead. 
 Processing and servicing expense increased by 19.5 million, or 26 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This increase is driven primarily by an increase in payment processing fees of 15.4 million, or 38 , related to increased payment volume for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, our platform fees increased by 6.0 million, or 39 , due to an increase in volume with a large enterprise partner. 
 Technology and data analytics 
 Technology and data analytics expense consists primarily of the salaries, stock-based compensation, and personnel-related costs of our engineering, product, and credit and analytics employees, as well as the amortization of internally-developed software and technology intangible assets, and our infrastructure and hosting costs. 
 Technology and data analytics expense increased by 1.3 million, or 1 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily driven by amortization of internally-developed software which increased by 13.5 million, or 44 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, as a result of an increase in the number of capitalized projects. Capitalized projects in service grew by 127 from approximately 440 projects as of September 30, 2023 to 1,000 projects as of September 30, 2024. The increase is partially offset by a decrease of 13.0 million, or 19 , in stock-based compensation and payroll and personnel-related costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, due to higher capitalized compensation costs related to internally-developed software. 
 Sales and marketing 
 Sales and marketing costs consist of the expense related to warrants and other share-based payments granted to our enterprise partners, salaries and personnel-related costs, costs of marketing and promotional activities. 
 Sales and marketing expense decreased by 1.6 million, or 1 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease is primarily driven by a 7.1 million, or 92 , decrease in the amortization of intangible assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, as a result of Returnly s intangible assets being fully amortized during the three months ended September 30, 2023, related to the wind down of our returns management platform. Additionally, amortization expense related to the Amazon commercial agreement decreased by 5.2 million, or 50 , primarily due to the renewal of the commercial partnership agreement in February 2024, which extended the amortization period of the commercial agreement asset. The decrease is partially offset by an 11.4 million, or 12 , increase in Amazon warrant expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to an increase in the number of new users to the Amazon program in the current period, which is the basis for a portion of the warrant expense. The amortization expense related to stock appreciation rights granted to an enterprise partner as part of a commercial agreement decreased by 2.1 million, as the expected benefit period ended during the prior fiscal year and the asset was fully amortized. We did not incur any expenses related to the stock appreciation rights during the three months ended September 30, 2024 
 General and administrative 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of expenses related to our finance, legal, risk operations, human resources, and administrative personnel. General and administrative expenses also include costs related to fees paid for professional services, including legal, tax and accounting services, allocated overhead, and certain discretionary expenses incurred from operating our technology platform. 
 63 

Table of Contents 

 General and administrative expense decreased by 1.9 million, or 1 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease is primarily due to a 9.4 million, or 8 , decrease in payroll and personnel-related costs compared to the same period in 2023, as a result of lower headcount during the period. The decrease is partially offset by an increase of 0.7 million in professional services compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Restructuring and other 
 Restructuring and other for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 1.9 million compared to the same period in 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we did not incur any costs related to exit and disposal activities. The associated restructuring and other expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2023 related to employee severance and other employment termination benefits offered in connection with the wind down of our returns management platform, Returnly. 
 Other income, net 
 Other income, net includes interest earned on our money market funds included in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, interest earned on securities available for sale, impairment or other adjustments to the cost basis of non-marketable equity securities held as cost, gains and losses on derivative agreements not designated within a hedging relationship, amortization of convertible debt issuance cost as well as gains (losses) on extinguishment, revolving credit facility issuance costs, fair value adjustments related to contingent liabilities, and other income or expense arising from activities that are unrelated to our primary business. 
 Other income, net, decreased by 4.4 million, or 11 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily driven by a decrease of 9.8 million in other non-operating income related to the wind-down of the Returnly business and our partnership with a third-party return provider during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, income from derivative instruments not designated in a hedge accounting relationship decreased by 7.9 million primarily driven by a decrease in the notional balance of the derivative instruments and a decrease in interest rates. We recognized a loss of 1.8 million on the change in fair value of liabilities, primarily related to our profit sharing liability, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a gain of 3.5 million during the same period in 2023, a decrease of 5.3 million. The decrease driven by each of these factors combined is partially offset by a 19.6 million gain recognized upon the repurchase of a portion of our 2026 Notes during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Sources and Uses of Funds 
 We maintain a capital-efficient model through a diverse set of funding sources. When we originate a loan directly or purchase a loan originated by our originating bank partners, we often utilize warehouse credit facilities with certain lenders to finance our lending activities or loan purchases. We sell the loans we originate or purchase from our originating bank partners to whole loan buyers and securitization investors through forward flow arrangements and securitization transactions, and earn servicing fees from continuing to act as the servicer on the loans. We proactively manage the allocation of loans on our platform across various funding channels based on several factors including, but not limited to, internal risk limits and policies, capital market conditions and channel economics. Our excess funding capacity and committed and long-term relationships with a diverse group of existing funding partners help provide flexibility as we optimize our funding to support the growth in loan volume.

 Our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, available for sale securities, available capacity from warehouse and revolving credit facilities, securitization trusts, forward flow loan sale arrangements, and certain cash flows from our operations. As of September 30, 2024, we had 2.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents and available for sale securities, 3.9 billion in available funding debt capacity, excluding our purchase commitments from third party loan buyers, and 330.0 million in borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility. We believe our principal sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet both our existing operating, working capital, and capital expenditure requirements and our currently planned growth for at least the next 12 months.

 International 
 We use various credit facilities to finance the origination of loan receivables in Canada. Similar to our U.S. warehouse credit facilities, borrowings under these agreements are referred to as funding debt, and proceeds from the borrowings may only be used for the purposes of facilitating loan funding and origination. These facilities are secured by Canadian loan receivables pledged to the respective facility as collateral, maturing between 2028 and 2030. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate commitment amount of these facilities was 652.9 million on a revolving basis, of which 407.0 million was drawn. 
 Sale and Repurchase Agreements 
 We entered into various sale and repurchase agreements pursuant to our retained interests in our off-balance sheet securitizations where we have sold these securities to a counterparty with an obligation to repurchase at a future date and price. These agreements have an initial term of three months and subject to mutual agreement by Affirm and the counterparty, we may enter into one or more repurchase date extensions, each for an additional three month term at market interest rates on such extension date. We had 22.4 million and 34.5 million in debt outstanding under our sale and repurchase agreements disclosed within funding debt in the interim condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. 
 Other Funding Sources 
 Securitizations 
 In connection with asset-backed securitizations, we sponsor and establish trusts (deemed to be VIEs) to ultimately purchase loans facilitated by our platform. Securities issued from our asset-backed securitizations are senior or subordinated, based on the waterfall criteria of loan payments to each security class. The subordinated residual interests issued from these transactions are first to absorb credit losses in accordance with the waterfall criteria. We consolidate securitization VIEs when we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and therefore have the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the VIEs economic performance and a variable interest that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Where we consolidate the securitization trusts, the loans held in the securitization trusts are included in loans held for investment, and the notes sold to third-party investors are recorded in notes issued by securitization trusts in the interim condensed consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 9. Securitization and Variable Interest Entities in the notes to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements for further details. 
 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 On June 26, 2024, we entered into an amendment to our revolving credit agreement under the terms of which the aggregate commitment was increased to 330.0 million and the final maturity date was extended three years to June 26, 2027. As of September 30, 2024, there are no borrowings outstanding under the facility. The facility contains certain covenants and restrictions, including certain financial maintenance covenants. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants in the agreements. Refer to Note 8. Debt in the notes to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements for further details on our revolving credit facility. 
 Forward Flow Loan Sale Arrangements 
 We have forward flow loan sale arrangements that facilitate the sale of whole loans across a diverse third-party investor base. Forward flow arrangements are generally fixed term in nature, with term lengths ranging between one to three years, during which we periodically sell loans to each counterparty based on the terms of our negotiated agreement.

 Cash Flow Analysis 
 
 The following table provides a summary of cash flow data during the periods indicated: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities 196,867 98,902 Net cash used in investing activities (574,999) (15,859) Net cash provided by financing activities 465,625 148,806 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 Our largest sources of operating cash are fees charged to merchant partners on transactions processed through our platform and interest income from consumers loans. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for general and administrative, technology and data analytics, funding costs, processing and servicing, and sales and marketing expenses. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 196.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Net loss of 100.2 million was adjusted for the add back of non-cash items and other adjustments increasing operating cash flows by 276.7 million, and changing operating assets liabilities resulting in a net increase in operating cash flows of 20.3 million. The non-cash item adjustments are primarily attributable to 159.8 million provision for credit losses, 107.3 million commercial agreement warrant expense, 94.2 million stock-based compensation expense, and 46.7 million depreciation and amortization expense, which were partially offset by 63.6 million gain on sale of loans and 52.1 million amortization of premiums and discounts on loans. The net increase in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by cash proceeds generated from the sale of loans held for sale of 1.2 billion which was offset by cash used for the purchase and origination of loans held for sale of 1.2 billion, a decrease in accounts receivable of 41.1 million, and an increase in accounts payable of 16.5 million, which were partially offset by a decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities of 23.8 million. 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 98.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net loss of 171.8 million was adjusted for the add back of net non-cash items and other adjustments increasing operating cash flows by 279.6 million, and changing operating assets liabilities resulting in a net increase of 8.9 million. The non-cash item adjustments are primarily attributable to 99.7 million provision for credit losses, 95.9 million commercial agreement warrant expense, 112.4 million stock-based compensation expense, and 40.1 million depreciation and amortization expense, which were partially offset by 34.3 million gain on sale of loans and 41.1 million amortization of premiums and discounts on loans. The net increase in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by net cash proceeds generated from the origination or purchase and sale of loans held for sale of 5.9 million and an increase in payable to third party loans owners of 55.6 million, which was partially offset by a decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities of 20.6 million and an increase in accounts receivable of 42.2 million. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 575.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which consisted of outflows related to 6.4 billion of purchases and origination of loans held for investment, including originated and purchased loans of 1.2 billion and 5.1 billion, respectively, during the period, 136.7 million of purchases of securities available for sale, and 44.2 million of property, equipment and software additions.

 million of purchases of securities available for sale, and 35.8 million of property, equipment and software additions. Inflows related to 3.2 billion of principal repayments of loans, 0.9 billion of proceeds from sale of loans held for investment, and 262.3 million of proceeds from maturities of securities available for sale. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 465.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and primarily consisted of net cash inflows of 750.0 million from the new issuance and repayment of notes and residual trust certificates issued by securitization trusts. This was partially offset by net cash outflows of 104.7 million related to borrowing and repayment of funding debt, 120.1 million related to the extinguishment of a portion of our 2026 Notes, and net cash outflows of 63.2 million related to taxes paid on vested RSUs. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 148.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and primarily consisted of net cash inflows of 234.6 million from the new issuance and repayment of notes and residual trust certificates issued by securitization trusts. This was partially offset by net cash outflows of 52.9 million related to borrowing and repayment of funding debt and 36.5 million related to taxes paid on vested RSUs. 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 
 There were no material changes outside of the ordinary course of business in our commitments and contractual obligations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from the commitments and contractual obligations disclosed in the section titled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Contractual Obligations , set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, which was filed with the SEC on August 28, 2024. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, we engage in activities that are not reflected on our interim condensed consolidated balance sheets, generally referred to as off-balance sheet arrangements. These activities involve transactions with unconsolidated VIEs, including our sponsored securitization transactions, which we contractually service. 
 
 For off-balance sheet loan sales where servicing is the only form of continuing involvement, we could experience a loss if we were required to repurchase a loan due to a breach in representations and warranties associated with our loan sale or servicing contracts. 
 
 For unconsolidated securitization transactions where Affirm is the sponsor and risk retention holder, Affirm could experience a loss of up to 5 of both the senior notes and residual trust certificates. In the unlikely event principal payments on the loans backing any off-balance sheet securitization are insufficient to pay holders of senior notes and residual trust certificates, including any retained interests held by Affirm, then any amounts we contributed to the securitization reserve accounts may be depleted. Refer to Note 9. Securitization and Variable Interest Entities in the notes to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements for further details . 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate outstanding balance of loans held by third-party investors and off-balance sheet securitizations was 5.2 billion. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because certain of these accounting policies require significant judgment, our actual results may 
 68 

Table of Contents 

 differ materially from our estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future consolidated financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows may be affected. We evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates on an ongoing basis and update them as necessary based on changes in market conditions or factors specific to us. There have been no material changes in our significant accounting policies or critical accounting estimates during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 For a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024 within Note 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.

 Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We have operations within the United States and Canada, and we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and interest rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates. Foreign currency exchange rates do not pose a material market risk exposure, as our current operations are primarily in the U.S. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our securities available for sale at fair value as of September 30, 2024 included 1.1 billion of marketable debt securities with maturities greater than three months. An increase in interest rates would have an adverse impact on the fair market value of our fixed rate securities while floating rate securities would produce less income than expected if interest rates were to decrease. Because our investment policy is to invest in conservative, liquid investments and because our business strategy does not rely on generating material returns from our investment portfolio, we do not expect our market risk exposure on marketable debt securities to be significant. 
 Continued volatility in interest rates and inflation, which may persist longer than previously expected, may adversely impact our consumers spending levels, and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us. Higher interest rates may lead to higher payment obligations on our future credit products but also for consumers other financial commitments, including their mortgages, credit cards, and other types of loans. Therefore, higher interest rates may lead to increased delinquencies, charge-offs, and allowances for loans and interest receivable, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results. 
 We rely on a variety of funding sources with varying degrees of interest rate sensitivities. Certain of our funding arrangements bear a variable interest rate. Given the fixed interest rates charged on the loans that we purchase from our originating bank partners or originate ourselves, a rising variable interest rate would reduce our interest margin earned in these funding arrangements. Additionally, certain of our loan sale agreements are repriced on a recurring basis using a mechanism tied to interest rates as well as loan performance. Increases in interest rates could reduce our loan sale economics. We also rely on securitization transactions, with notes typically bearing a fixed coupon. For future securitization issuances, higher interest rates could have several outcomes. For consolidated securitizations, higher interest rates may result in higher coupons paid and therefore higher funding costs. For transactions that are not consolidated, higher interest rates may impact overall deal economics which are a function of numerous transaction terms. 
 We maintain an interest rate risk management program which measures and manages the potential volatility of earnings that may arise from changes in interest rates. We use interest rate derivatives to mitigate the effects of changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt which eliminates some, but not all, of the interest rate risk. Some of these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. For those contracts designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivatives is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and is reclassified into funding costs in the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings. Factoring in the interest rate risk management program and the repricing of investment securities, as of September 30, 2024, we estimate that a hypothetical instantaneous 100 basis point upward parallel shock to interest rates would have a less than 55.0 million adverse impact on our cash flows associated with our market risk sensitive instruments over the next 12 months. This measure projects the changes in cash flows associated with all assets and liabilities, including derivatives, based on contractual market rate-based repricing conditions over a twelve-month time horizon. It considers forecasted business growth and anticipated future funding mix.

 Credit Risk 
 We have credit risk primarily related to our consumer loans held for investment. We are exposed to default risk on both loan receivables purchased from our originating bank partners and loan receivables that are directly originated. The ultimate collectability of a substantial portion of the loan portfolio is susceptible to changes in economic and market conditions. To manage this risk, we utilize our proprietary underwriting models to make lending decisions, score, and price loans in a manner that we believe is reflective of the credit risk. Other credit levers, such as user limits and/or down payment requirements, are used to determine the likelihood of a consumer being able to pay. 
 
 To monitor portfolio performance, we utilize a wide range of internal and external metrics to review user and loan populations. Each week, management reviews performance for each consumer segment, typically split by ITACs model score, financial product originated, age of loan, and delinquency status. Internal performance trendlines are measured against external factors such as unemployment, CPI, and consumer sentiment to determine what changes, if any, in risk strategy is warranted. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, we were exposed to credit risk on 6.3 billion and 5.7 billion, respectively, of loans held on our interim condensed consolidated balance sheet. Loan receivables are diversified geographically. As of both September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, approximately 11 of loan receivables related to customers residing in the state of California. No other states or provinces exceeded 10 . In addition, we have credit risk exposure in relation to certain off-balance sheet loans sold to third parties where we have entered into risk sharing arrangements and through our retained interests in unconsolidated securitization trusts. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, we have sold 5.6 billion and 4.2 billion, respectively, unpaid principal balance of loans which are subject to risk sharing arrangements, of which our maximum exposure to losses was 101.5 million and 81.2 million, respectively. This amount includes our maximum potential loss with respect to risk sharing liabilities of 56.2 million and the fair value of risk sharing assets of 45.3 million, as of September 30, 2024. The fair value of notes receivable and residual trust certificate retained interests in unconsolidated securitization trusts was 38.9 million and 14.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 
 We are also exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the financial institutions holding our cash and the issuers of our cash equivalents and available for sale securities. We maintain our cash deposits and cash equivalents in highly-rated, federally-insured financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits. We manage this risk by conducting business with well-established financial institutions, diversifying our counterparties and having guidelines regarding credit rating and investment maturities to safeguard liquidity. Although, we are not substantially dependent on a single financing source and have not historically experienced any credit losses related to these financial institutions, if multiple financing sources were to be unable to fulfill their funding obligations to us, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer CEO and our Chief Financial Officer CFO ), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the requisite time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Inherent Limitation on the Effectiveness of Internal Control 
 
 The effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting is subject to inherent limitations, including the exercise of judgment in designing, implementing, operating, and evaluating the controls and procedures, and the inability to eliminate misconduct completely. Accordingly, any system of internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable, not absolute assurance that its objectives will be met. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. We intend to continue to monitor and upgrade our internal controls as necessary or appropriate for our business but such improvements will be subject to the same inherent limitations outlined in this section.
