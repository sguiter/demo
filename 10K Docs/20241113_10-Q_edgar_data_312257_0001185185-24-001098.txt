Critical Accounting Policy and Estimates 

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements 

The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates include certain assumptions related to, among others, doubtful accounts receivable, valuation of stock-based services, operating right of use assets and liabilities, and income taxes. On an on-going basis, we evaluate these estimates, including those related to revenue recognition and concentration of credit risk. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Accounts subject to estimate and judgements are accounts receivable reserves, income taxes, intangible assets, contingent liabilities, and equity-based instruments. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe our estimates have not been materially inaccurate in past years, and our assumptions are not likely to change in the foreseeable future. 

Provision for Doubtful Accounts Receivable 

The Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts equal to the estimated uncollectible amounts pursuant to the guidance of Accounting Standards Update ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326), as codified in Accounts Standards Codification ASC 326, Financial Instruments Credit Losses . Under ASC 326, the Company utilizes a current and expected credit loss (CECL) impairment model. ASU 2016-13 became effective for us on January 1, 2023. The Company s estimate is based on historical collection experience and a review of the current status of trade accounts receivable. It is reasonably possible that the Company s estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts will change. Accounts receivable are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of 87,149 and 46,477 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

The Company measures its financial assets and liabilities in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The estimated fair values approximate their carrying value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments or the stated interest rates are indicative of market interest rates. These fair values have historically varied due to the market price of the Company s stock at the date of valuation. 

Income Taxes 

The Company uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. The measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of applicable tax law. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance based on the amount of tax benefits that, based on available evidence, is not expected to be realized. 

Leases 

The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating lease right-of-use assets ROU assets and short-term and long-term lease liabilities are included on the face of the condensed consolidated balance sheet. Finance lease ROU assets are presented within other assets, and finance lease liabilities are presented within accrued liabilities. 

ROU assets represent the right of use to an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of the Company s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The operating lease ROU asset also excludes lease incentives. The Company s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for as a single lease component. For lease agreements with terms less than 12 months, the Company has elected the short-term lease measurement and recognition exemption, and it recognizes such lease payments on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 

Our Business Activities 

We build dynamic scalable businesses by selling specialty foods that are difficult to find through traditional channels. Our expertise is forging close relationships with the producers, growers, makers and distributors of specialty products, then carefully selecting our suppliers based on their quality, uniqueness and reliability. 

30

Table of Contents 

The IVFH team is adept at evaluating and certifying the food safety and supply chain capabilities of small batch producers who don t typically sell through broad-based sales channels. We seek out the freshest, most unique, origin-specific gourmet cheese, meat, produce, and premium ingredients available, and distribute them directly from our robust network of vendors and warehouses within 24 72 hours of an order being placed. We also source, package, and brand a meaningful segment of these products ourselves, enabling us to better control the assortment, offer more flexibility and variety to our customers, and capture additional margin. 

We leverage this unique, premium assortment to serve the needs of Professional Chefs in settings such as restaurants, hotels, country clubs, national chain accounts, casinos, hospitals and catering houses. We provide these premium customers with products that can t typically be found through their broadline distributor s warehouse assortment. We distribute these products directly to Professional Chefs in Chicago through our subsidiary, Artisan Specialty Foods, Inc., and nationally through our e-commerce businesses on Amazon.com and our own website. We also drop ship specialty foods to Professional Chefs nationally through the websites of broadline distributors, such as US Foods, Inc. Lastly, we sell these food to large retailers for resale on their shelves to the end customer. Between this variety of sales channels, we are able to serve our Professional Chef customers wherever they are located. 

We operate our new retail business, as well as our airline catering distribution business, out of our 200,000 square foot facility in Mountain Top, Pennsylvania,. We also operate warehouse activities in our owned 28,000 square foot facility in the greater Chicago area. Once our acquisition of Golden Organics closes, we will have another warehouse, operating out of Denver, CO, measuring approximately 20,000 square feet. We have the capabilities to pack and ship frozen, refrigerated, and ambient products, enabling us to sell a broad range of specialty foods. We also have GFSI/SQF certifications, allowing compatibility with the highest standards of food handling supply chains in the world, and the quality and food safety that our premium customers expect from us. These warehouses have the ability to ship packages and pallets of all sizes through overnight shipping. We also leverage our own fleet of trucks to deliver directly to our Professional Chef customers within our reach. 

Our proprietary technology platform underpins our entire business, driving transparency and efficiency up and down the supply chain. Orders flow in real time, whether to our warehouses or to our vendor partners, to allow for fast handling and fulfillment. Our picking is enabled by efficient scan-based, handheld devices, ensuring order and inventory accuracy. Our warehouse management software optimizes pick routes for common items and order types, recommends a box size, and calculates the appropriate amount of packaging and ice required based on forecasted temperatures along the delivery route. 

We have built a team consisting of passionate, committed, and food-obsessed people: our average tenure (outside of seasonal workers) across the Company is over five years. Our merchandising team has deep connections within the specialty food space around the globe. Our customer service and sales teams, as ex-chefs themselves, go beyond customer service to offer our Professional Chefs customer support, menu ideas, and preparation guidance. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

This discussion may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our future results could differ materially from the forward-looking statements discussed in this report. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, the notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in the report. 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Revenue 

Revenue increased by 51,282, or approximately 0.3 , to 17.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 17.0 million in the prior year. During the third quarter of 2024, our consumer e-commerce business experienced a decline of 704 thousand, representing a 38.6 decrease, as we intentionally continued to maintain the business operations on a shoestring, and completed the sale of the business. With the recent announcement and sale of our direct-to-consumer igourmet assets, we have a definitive timeline of when these headwinds will subside. Despite the declines from the direct-to-consumer e-commerce business, our Specialty Foodservice business has shown significant progress, growing by 5.5 and generating an additional 808 thousand in sales for the quarter. This growth was driven by accelerating growth in our airline caterer distribution business, material new growth in the broadline distributor partnerships, and continued growth in our Artisan Specialty Foods business in Chicago. While this growth was somewhat offset by the continued challenges associated with the transition of the technology platform of one of our largest customers, these negative year-over-year trends softened relative to the second quarter of 2024.

We also saw a decrease in our logistics business, from 358,717 in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 305,973 in the three months ended September 30, 2024. This decline was due to softness in demand from our existing customers, which resulted in less volume throughput for our logistics services. Though small, we continue to seek new opportunities to leverage our logistics services in order to better leverage existing fixed assets.

Gross margins as a percentage of sales decreased during the current period to 25.2 , compared to 26.8 in the comparable period, representing a decline of 158 basis points, driven by our continued ramp down of the consumer e-commerce business, some one-time benefits in our Specialty Foodservice business last year, and margin investments to acquire new retail business customers. Although our margins have declined, they continue to stabilize as we transition away from the direct-to-consumer e-commerce business. In the three months ended September 30, 2024, we also benefited from a renegotiated contract with our shipping provider, which significantly reduced shipping expenses. 

Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses 

Selling, general, and administrative expenses SG A decreased by 0.6 million, or 14.1 , to 3.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 4.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. SG A as a percentage of sales decreased from 24.5 of sales during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 21.0 of sales during the current period as we continued to thoughtfully reduce our expense structure. The decrease in SG A was primarily due to a decrease in non-cash compensation of 0.3 million, a decrease advertising of 0.2 million, a decrease in payroll and related costs of 0.1 million, a decrease in amortization and depreciation of 0.1 million, and a decrease in office, facilities, and vehicles costs of 0.1 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in legal and professional fees of 0.2 million related to our acquisition and divestiture activity. Excluding non-cash compensation and non-recurring legal transactional expenses, SG A would have decreased by 0.5 million, or 11.0 , resulting in a 222 basis point reduction in SG A as a percentage of sales compared to the comparable period. 

Interest expense, net 

Interest expense, net of interest income, decreased by 43,719, or approximately 16.8 , to 217,275 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 260,994 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. There was an increase in interest income in the amount of 11,403 due to higher cash balances during the period. There was also a decrease in interest expense accrued or paid on the Company s commercial loans and notes payable in the amount of 32,314 due to lower principal balances, driven by the payoff of the Company s loan associated with its Florida office building, which was sold in January 2024. 

Gain on Sale of Assets 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold certain intangible assets of igourmet for a gain in the amount of 834,463. There was no comparable transaction in the prior period. 

Other Leasing Income

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Revenue 

Revenue decreased by 2.8 million, or approximately 5.3 , to 49.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 52.2 million in the prior year. E-commerce was the primary driver of our year-over-year decline with revenue decreasing by 44.3 and 2.9 million. On the e-commerce business, as previously stated, we finalized the sale of the igourmet assets which will continue to be reported in continuing operations which will result in a revenue headwind of 7.4 million over the next 12 months. On the Specialty Foodservice business, our revenues have increased by 0.7 , as we return to positive growth on the year. As previously stated on earnings calls, we expect to deliver positive growth for the Specialty Foodservice business for the 2024 year. 

We continue to assess the potential of new revenue sources from new and growing broadline relationships, retail partnerships, airline caterer distribution growth, and other initiatives. We expect these new revenue sources to accelerate significantly in Q4. 

We continue to see declines in our logistics business (from 877,729 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 763,441 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024) as our customers have faced demand softness on their side. 

See Transactions with Major Customers and the SEC mandated FR-60 disclosures following the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for a further discussion of the significant customer concentrations, loss of significant customer, critical accounting policies and estimates, and other factors that could affect future results. 

Cost of Goods Sold 

Our cost of goods sold for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 37.3 million, a decrease of 2.0 million, or approximately 5.2 , compared to cost of goods sold of 39.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of goods sold was made up of the following expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024: cost of goods of specialty, meat, game, cheese, seafood, poultry and other sales categories in the amount of 27.9 million; shipping, delivery, handling, and purchase allowance expenses in the amount of 9.0 million; and cost of goods associated with logistics of 0.4 million. Gross margins as a percentage of sales remained at 24.5 during the current period, which was no change from the comparable period, as we continued implementing our strategy to improve cost controls, better manage pricing, and focus more on product mix. After adjusting for the second quarter 2024 liquidation efforts, in the amount of 0.1 million, our YTD gross margins improved by 119 basis points versus comparable period. As we launch our new retail business, we expect margin compression in the fourth quarter of 2024 as we work to optimize our business model. 

Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses 

SG A decreased by 1.3 million, or approximately 10.4 , to 11.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 12.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in SG A was primarily due to a decrease in payroll and related costs of 0.5 million; advertising costs of 0.5 million; office, facilities, and vehicles of 0.3 million; amortization and depreciation of 0.2 million; and computer and IT costs of 0.1 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in professional and legal fees of 0.1 million, associated with divestiture and acquisition activity, and non-cash compensation of 0.2 million. SG A as a percentage of sales decreased from 24.5 of sales during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 23.2 of sales during the current period as we continued to thoughtfully reduce our expense structure.

Additionally, the Company is actively exploring various avenues to raise additional capital to support future growth and ensure a robust level of liquidity. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had cash used in operating activities of 2,717,332. Cash flow used in operations consisted of the Company s consolidated net income of 2,657,380 less gain on disposition of assets of 2,755,166 and gain on sale of subsidiary of 21,126, plus non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization of 211,488, increase in value of stock appreciation rights of 476,161, stock-based compensation in the amount of 313,773, provision for doubtful accounts of 40,667, amortization of right-of-use assets of 12,740, and amortization of discount on notes payable of 3,850.

Excluding 379,381 in payments associated with the separation and hiring of key officers referenced earlier, the Company would have recorded cash used in operating activities of 2,337,951 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 141,672 compared to 2,196,279 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

This improvement of 7,955,944 can be largely attributed to the reclassification of our Mountaintop facility as an asset held for sale, with a book value of 5,941,933 as of September 30, 2024. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported a profit from continuing operations amounting to 2,666,004.

In addition to cash cash equivalent totaling 4,820,970, the Company has access to an untapped 1.5 million revolving credit facility with MapleMark Bank. 

During 2024, management is focused on continuing the Stabilization phase of its three-phase plan, focusing on the fundamentals of running a cash flow positive business, serving Professional Chefs, including a focus on improving margins.

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues, or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

The Company has seen the impact of inflation across its costs for fuel, shipping, cost of goods, and marketing. Balancing the management of these increases with the willingness of our customers to pay higher prices will continue to be a key focus for the Company this year. However, no assurance can be given that we will be successful and inflationary pressure on our profits will likely continue through 2024.
