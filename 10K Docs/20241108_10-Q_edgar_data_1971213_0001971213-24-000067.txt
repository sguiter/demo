GENERAL 
 
 This combined report on Form 10-Q is filed by both Sinclair, Inc. ("Sinclair") and Sinclair Broadcast Group, LLC ("SBG"). Certain information contained in this document relating to SBG is filed by Sinclair and separately by SBG. SBG makes no representation as to information relating to Sinclair or its subsidiaries, except as it may relate to SBG and its subsidiaries. References in this report to "we," "us," "our," the "Company," and similar terms refer to Sinclair and its consolidated subsidiaries, including SBG, unless context indicates otherwise. As described under Company Reorganization in Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within Sinclair's Consolidated Financial Statements below, upon consummation of the Reorganization (as defined therein) on June 1, 2023, Sinclair became the successor issuer to Sinclair Broadcast Group, Inc. ("Old Sinclair"), which, immediately following the Reorganization, was converted into a limited liability company. SBG files reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") solely to comply with Section 1018(a) of the indenture governing the 5.125 Senior Notes due 2027 of Sinclair Television Group, Inc. ("STG"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of SBG. References to SBG herein may also include its predecessor, Old Sinclair, as context indicates. 

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This report includes or incorporates forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, and the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions about us, including, among other things, the following risks. All risk factors are deemed to be related to both Sinclair and its subsidiaries, including SBG. Any risks only applicable to Sinclair are denoted as such. 
 
 Industry risks 
 
 The business conditions of our advertisers and their ability to pay for services provided; 
 the performance of networks and syndicators that provide us with programming content, as well as the performance of internally originated programming; 
 multi-channel video programming distributors ("MVPD") and virtual MVPD's (" vMVPD," and together with MVPDs, "Distributors") subscriber churn due to the impact of technological changes, the proliferation of over-the-top ("OTT") direct-to-consumer platforms, the loss of key entertainment and sports programming previously exclusively available to subscribers, and economic conditions on consumers' desire to pay for subscription services; 
 the business conditions of the Distributors we do business with and their ability to pay to broadcast our content on their distribution platforms; 
 the loss of appeal of our local news, network content, syndicated program content, and sports programming, which may be unpredictable; 
 the availability and cost of programming from networks and syndicators, as well as the cost of internally originated programming; 
 for Sinclair, the availability and cost of rights to air professional tennis tournaments; 
 our relationships with networks and their strategies to distribute their programming via means other than their local television affiliates, such as OTT or direct-to-consumer content; 
 labor disputes and legislation and other union activity associated with film, acting, writing, music, and other guilds; 
 the broadcasting community's ability to develop and adopt a viable mobile digital broadcast television ("mobile DTV") strategy and platform, such as the adoption of a next generation broadcast standard ("NextGen TV"), the consumer's appetite for mobile television, and the industry's acceptance of data distribution services; 
 the impact of programming payments charged by networks pursuant to their affiliation agreements with broadcasters requiring compensation for network programming; 
 the effects of declining live/appointment viewership as reported through rating systems and local television efforts to adopt and receive credit for same day viewing plus viewing on-demand thereafter; 
 changes in television rating measurement methodologies that could negatively impact audience results; 
 the ability of Distributors to coordinate and determine local advertising rates as a consortium; 
 the lack of our ability to negotiate directly with vMVPD's for the distribution of much of our content; 
 the operation of low power devices in the broadcast spectrum, which could interfere with our broadcast; and 
 the impact of Distributors and OTTs offering "skinny" programming bundles that may not include television broadcast stations or other programming that we distribute. 

Table of Contents 

Regulatory risks 
 
 The Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") task force appointed to help ensure a smoother roll-out of NextGen TV could impact business-use cases for the NextGen TV technology and the timeframe for the discontinuance of ATSC 1.0; 
 the potential for additional governmental regulation of broadcasting or changes in those regulations and court actions interpreting those regulations, including ownership regulations limiting over-the-air television's ability to compete effectively (including regulations relating to joint sales agreements ("JSA"), shared services agreements ("SSA"), cross ownership rules, the national ownership cap, and the UHF discount), arbitrary enforcement by the FCC including indecency regulations, retransmission consent regulations, and political or other advertising restrictions, such as payola rules; 
 the impact of FCC and Congressional efforts which may restrict a television station's retransmission consent negotiations; 
 the impact of FCC rules requiring broadcast stations to publish, among other information, political advertising rates online; 
 the potential impact from changes in lowest unit rate applicability associated with political advertising spots; 
 our ability to obtain regulatory approval for transactions related to FCC licenses; 
 the potential impact from changes in industry ownership and multicast rules; 
 our ability to execute on our initiatives and goals related to environmental, social and governance ("ESG") matters and the increasing legal and regulatory focus on ESG by numerous jurisdictions with varying requirements; and 
 the impact of foreign government rules related to digital and online assets. 
 
 Risks specific to us 
 
 The amount paid to Diamond Sports Group, LLC ("DSG") as a result of the settlement agreement could have a material adverse effect on Sinclair and SBG's financial condition and results of operations; 
 our ability to attract and maintain local, national, and network advertising and successfully participate in new sales channels such as programmatic and addressable advertising through business partnership ventures and the development of technology; 
 our ability to service our debt obligations and operate our business under restrictions contained in our financing agreements; 
 our use of derivative financial instruments to reduce interest rate risk may result in added volatility in the amount of interest expense recorded within our financial results and the amount of cash interest paid; 
 our ability to successfully implement and monetize our own content management system designed to provide our viewers significantly improved content via the internet and other digital platforms; 
 our ability to successfully renegotiate retransmission consent and distribution agreements for our existing and any acquired businesses with favorable terms; 
 the ability of stations which we consolidate, but do not negotiate on their behalf, to successfully renegotiate retransmission consent and affiliation fees (cable network fees) agreements and comply with laws and regulations that apply to them; 
 our ability to renew our FCC licenses; 
 our ability to identify investment opportunities; 
 our ability to successfully integrate any acquired businesses, as well as the success of our new content and distribution initiatives in a competitive environment, including CHARGE!, TBD, Comet, The Nest, other original programming, mobile DTV, FAST channels, and direct-to-consumer platforms; 
 our ability to maintain our affiliation and programming service agreements with our networks and program service providers and, at renewal, to successfully negotiate these agreements with favorable terms; 
 our ability to generate synergies and leverage new revenue opportunities; 
 changes in the makeup of the population in the areas where our stations are located; 
 our ability to effectively respond to technology affecting our industry; 
 our ability to deploy NextGen TV nationwide, including the ability and appetite of manufacturers to install the technology within their products, as well as monetize the associated technology; 
 the strength of ratings for our local news broadcasts including our news sharing arrangements; 
 risks associated with the use of artificial intelligence by us and third parties, including our use in the operations of our business; 
 the results of prior year tax audits by taxing authorities; 
 for Sinclair, our ability to execute on our investment and growth strategies related to our subsidiary, Sinclair Ventures, LLC ("Ventures"); and 

Table of Contents

 General risks 
 
 The impact of changes in national and regional economies and credit and capital markets; 
 loss of consumer confidence; 
 the potential impact of changes in tax law; 
 the activities of our competitors; 
 risks associated with the inability of key suppliers and other third parties to provide services to us; 
 geopolitical conditions, including the war in Ukraine, conflicts in the Middle East, and international trade sanctions, could negatively impact global supply prices and disrupt supply chain levels, which could negatively impact the operations of us, our customers', our vendors', and our Distributors'; 
 natural disasters and pandemics (such as the outbreak and worldwide spread of COVID-19) that impact our employees, Distributors, advertisers, suppliers, stations, and networks; and 
 cybersecurity incidents, data privacy, and other information technology failures related to us and our vendors have, and in the future may, adversely affect us and disrupt our operations. 
 
 Other matters set forth in this report, including the Risk Factors set forth in Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, may also cause actual results in the future to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. However, additional factors and risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also cause actual results in the future to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, events described in the forward-looking statements discussed in this report might not occur.

. Contract payments are made in installments over terms that are generally equal to or shorter than the contract period. Pursuant to accounting guidance for the broadcasting industry, an asset and a liability for the rights acquired and obligations incurred under a license agreement are reported on the balance sheet when the cost of each program is known or reasonably determinable, the program material has been accepted by the licensee in accordance with the conditions of the license agreement, and the program is available for its first showing or telecast. The portion of program contracts which becomes payable within one year is reflected as a current liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
 The rights to this programming are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. Program costs are amortized on a straight-line basis except for contracts greater than which are amortized utilizing an accelerated method. Program costs estimated by management to be amortized in the succeeding year are classified as current assets. Payments of program contract liabilities are typically made on a scheduled basis and are not affected by amortization or fair value adjustments. 
 
 Fair value is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow model based on management's expectation of future advertising revenues, net of sales commissions, to be generated by the program material. We assess our program costs on a quarterly basis to ensure the costs are recorded at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value.

million correcting adjustment related to the accrual of interest income attributable to prior years' pending income tax refund claims. Our effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023 approximated the statutory rate. Our effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was greater than the statutory rate primarily due to a release of the 2023 valuation allowance on deferred tax assets relating to deductibility of interest expense under the Internal Revenue Code Section 163(j) ("IRC Section 163(j)") as a result of the change in the tax classification of the legal entity owning the DSG business from a partnership to disregarded entity because of the exit of the sole minority investor. 
 
 We do not believe that our liability for unrecognized tax benefits would be materially impacted, in the next twelve months, as a result of the expected statute of limitations expirations, the application of limits under available state administrative practice exceptions, and the resolution of examination issues and settlements with federal and certain state tax authorities.

The Company submitted the million payment on August 19, 2020. As part of the consent decree, the Company also agreed to implement a -year compliance plan. petitions were filed on June 8, 2020 seeking reconsideration of the Order and Consent Decree. The Company filed an opposition to the petitions on June 18, 2020, and the petitions remain pending. The consent decree expired on May 29, 2024. 
 
 On September 1, 2020, one of the individuals who filed a petition for reconsideration of the Order and Consent Decree filed a petition to deny the license renewal application of WBFF(TV), Baltimore, MD, and the license renewal applications of two other Baltimore, MD stations with which the Company has a JSA or LMA, Deerfield Media station WUTB(TV) and Cunningham Broadcasting Corporation ("Cunningham") station WNUV(TV). The Company filed an opposition to the petition on October 1, 2020. On January 18, 2024, a motion was filed to request substitution of the petitioner, who is deceased. On January 29, 2024, the Company filed (1) an opposition to the motion for substitution and (2) a motion to dismiss the petition to deny the renewal applications. An opposition was filed to the motion to dismiss on February 5, 2024, and the Company timely filed its reply on February 13, 2024, and the matter remains pending. 
 
 On September 2, 2020, the FCC adopted a Memorandum Opinion and Order and NAL against the licensees of several stations with whom the Company has LMAs, JSAs, and/or SSAs in response to a complaint regarding those stations' retransmission consent negotiations. The NAL proposed a million penalty for each station, totaling million. The licensees filed a response to the NAL on October 15, 2020, asking the FCC to dismiss the proceeding or, alternatively, to reduce the proposed forfeiture to per station. On July 28, 2021, the FCC issued a forfeiture order in which the million penalty was upheld for all but one station. A Petition for Reconsideration of the forfeiture order was filed on August 7, 2021. On March 14, 2022, the FCC released a Memorandum Opinion and Order and Order on Reconsideration, which reaffirmed the forfeiture order, and dismissed (and in the alternative, denied) the Petition for Reconsideration, and stated that because the fines were not paid within the period stated in the July 2021 forfeiture order the FCC may refer the case to the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") for enforcement of the forfeiture pursuant to Section 504 of the Communications Act. Our understanding is that enforcement remains pending. The Company is not a party to this forfeiture order; however, our consolidated financial statements include an accrual of additional expenses of million for the above legal matters during the year ended December 31, 2021, as we consolidate these stations as VIEs.

 Company stations and several stations with whom the Company has LMAs, JSAs, and/or SSAs, for violation of the FCC's limitations on commercial matter in children's television programming related to KidsClick network programming distributed by the Company in 2018. The NAL proposed a fine of million against the Company, and fines ranging from to per station for the other licensees, including the LMA, JSA, and/or SSA stations, for a total of million. As of September 30, 2024, we have accrued million. On October 21, 2022, the Company filed a written response seeking reduction of the proposed fine amount. On September 6, 2024, the FCC denied the Company's request for reduction of the fine (and similar requests filed by certain other licensees) and issued a forfeiture order imposing the fine as proposed in the NAL. The Company and all other affected licensees filed a joint petition for reconsideration of the forfeiture order on October 7, 2024 and the matter remains pending. 
 
 Other Matters 
 
 On November 6, 2018, the Company agreed to enter into a proposed consent decree with the DOJ. This consent decree resolves the DOJ's investigation into the sharing of pacing information among certain stations in some local markets. The DOJ filed the consent decree and related documents in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on November 13, 2018. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia entered the consent decree on May 22, 2019. The consent decree is not an admission of any wrongdoing by the Company and does not subject the Company to any monetary damages or penalties. The Company believes that even if the pacing information was shared as alleged, it would not have impacted any pricing of advertisements or the competitive nature of the market. The consent decree requires the Company to adopt certain antitrust compliance measures, including the appointment of an Antitrust Compliance Officer, consistent with what the DOJ has required in previous consent decrees in other industries. The consent decree also requires the Company's stations not to exchange pacing and certain other information with other stations in their local markets, which the Company's management had already instructed them not to do. 
 
 The Company is aware of putative class action lawsuits that were filed against the Company following published reports of the DOJ investigation into the exchange of pacing data within the industry. On October 3, 2018, these lawsuits were consolidated in the Northern District of Illinois. The consolidated action alleges that the Company and other broadcasters conspired to fix prices for commercials to be aired on broadcast television stations throughout the United States and engaged in unlawful information sharing, in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. The consolidated action seeks damages, attorneys' fees, costs and interest, as well as injunctions against adopting practices or plans that would restrain competition in the ways the plaintiffs have alleged. The Court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss on November 6, 2020. Discovery commenced shortly after that and is continuing. Under the current schedule set by the Court, fact discovery is scheduled to close 90 days after a Special Master completes his review of the plaintiffs' objections to the defendant's privilege claims. That privilege review is ongoing. On August 18, 2023, the defendants filed objections to the Special Master's First Report and Recommendations with the Court. The Court overruled the defendants' objections on January 31, 2024. The Special Master has not indicated when he expects to complete his privilege review. On December 8, 2023, the Court granted final approval of the settlements the plaintiffs had reached with four of the original defendants (CBS, Fox, Cox Media, and ShareBuilders), who agreed to pay a total of million to settle the plaintiffs' claims against them. The Company and the other non-settling defendants continue to believe the lawsuits are without merit and intend to vigorously defend themselves against all such claims. 
 
 On July 19, 2023, as part of bankruptcy proceedings of DSG, an independently managed and unconsolidated subsidiary of Sinclair, DSG and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Diamond Sports Net, LLC, filed a complaint (the "Diamond Litigation"), under seal, in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas naming certain subsidiaries of Sinclair, including SBG and STG and certain officers of SBG and STG, as defendants.

 billion as a result of the alleged misconduct. The complaint asserted a variety of claims, including certain fraudulent transfers of assets, unlawful distributions and payments, breaches of contracts, unjust enrichment and breaches of fiduciary duties. The plaintiffs sought, among other relief, avoidance of fraudulent transfers and unlawful distributions, and unspecified monetary damages to be determined. 
 
 On March 1, 2024, the court approved a global settlement and release of all claims associated with the Diamond Litigation, which settlement included an amendment to the MSA. Sinclair entered into the settlement, without admitting any fault or wrongdoing. The settlement terms included, among other things, DSG's dismissal with prejudice of its billion litigation against Sinclair and all other defendants, along with the full and final satisfaction and release of all claims in that litigation against all defendants, including Sinclair and its subsidiaries, in exchange for Sinclair's cash payment to DSG of million. Additionally, under the terms of the settlement, Sinclair would provide transition services to DSG to allow DSG to become a self-standing entity going forward. During the first quarter of 2024, we paid million related to the settlement. The final settlement payment was made during the second quarter of 2024 and of the total million settlement amount paid, million was paid by STG and million was paid by Ventures. 
 
 As described under Note 3. Notes Payable, Finance Leases, and Commercial Bank Financing we have provided a guarantee that requires us to provide funding to Marquee under certain circumstances. On July 19, 2024, Marquee sent us a funding notice seeking million under the Marquee guarantee by August 1, 2024 purportedly to make payments under certain agreements to affiliates of the Chicago Cubs, an affiliate of which is also a co-owner of Marquee. Based on the information provided to us by Marquee, Marquee has sufficient cash to make such payments without funding under the Marquee guarantee. For this and other reasons, we do not believe we are contractually required to provide funding under the Marquee guarantee at this time and have so informed Marquee. On August 2, 2024, Marquee sent us another letter claiming that our failure to timely pay the amounts subject to Marquee's funding notice constitutes a breach of the Marquee guarantee and requesting payment of such amounts no later than August 17, 2024 at which time Marquee has stated it will pursue any and all available remedies pursuant to the Marquee guarantee. This dispute may result in litigation, and based on our expectation of Marquee's claims, we believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to vigorously defend against such claims.

 Fair value is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow model based on management's expectation of future advertising revenues, net of sales commissions, to be generated by the program material.

million correcting adjustment related to the accrual of interest income attributable to prior years' pending income tax refund claims. SBG's effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was less than the statutory rate primarily due to non-deductible expenses offset by federal tax credits. SBG's effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was greater than the statutory rate primarily due to a release of the 2023 valuation allowance on deferred tax assets relating to deductibility of interest expense under the IRC Section 163(j) as a result of the change in the tax classification of the legal entity owning the DSG business because of the exit of the sole minority investor. 
 
 SBG does not believe that our liability for unrecognized tax benefits would be materially impacted, in the next twelve months, as a result of the expected statute of limitations expirations, the application of limits under available state administrative practice exceptions, and the resolution of examination issues and settlements with federal and certain state tax authorities.

The Company submitted the million payment on August 19, 2020. As part of the consent decree, the Company also agreed to implement a -year compliance plan. petitions were filed on June 8, 2020 seeking reconsideration of the Order and Consent Decree. The Company filed an opposition to the petitions on June 18, 2020, and the petitions remain pending. The consent decree expired on May 29, 2024. 
 
 On September 1, 2020, one of the individuals who filed a petition for reconsideration of the Order and Consent Decree filed a petition to deny the license renewal application of WBFF(TV), Baltimore, MD, and the license renewal applications of two other Baltimore, MD stations with which the Company has a JSA or LMA, Deerfield Media station WUTB(TV) and Cunningham Broadcasting Corporation ("Cunningham") station WNUV(TV).

The Company and all other affected licensees filed a joint petition for reconsideration of the forfeiture order on October 7, 2024 and the matter remains pending. 
 
 Other Matters 
 
 On November 6, 2018, the Company agreed to enter into a proposed consent decree with the DOJ. This consent decree resolves the DOJ's investigation into the sharing of pacing information among certain stations in some local markets. The DOJ filed the consent decree and related documents in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on November 13, 2018. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia entered the consent decree on May 22, 2019. The consent decree is not an admission of any wrongdoing by the Company and does not subject the Company to any monetary damages or penalties. The Company believes that even if the pacing information was shared as alleged, it would not have impacted any pricing of advertisements or the competitive nature of the market. The consent decree requires the Company to adopt certain antitrust compliance measures, including the appointment of an Antitrust Compliance Officer, consistent with what the DOJ has required in previous consent decrees in other industries. The consent decree also requires the Company's stations not to exchange pacing and certain other information with other stations in their local markets, which the Company's management had already instructed them not to do. 
 
 The Company is aware of putative class action lawsuits that were filed against the Company following published reports of the DOJ investigation into the exchange of pacing data within the industry. On October 3, 2018, these lawsuits were consolidated in the Northern District of Illinois. The consolidated action alleges that the Company and other broadcasters conspired to fix prices for commercials to be aired on broadcast television stations throughout the United States and engaged in unlawful information sharing, in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. The consolidated action seeks damages, attorneys' fees, costs and interest, as well as injunctions against adopting practices or plans that would restrain competition in the ways the plaintiffs have alleged. The Court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss on November 6, 2020. Discovery commenced shortly after that and is continuing. Under the current schedule set by the Court, fact discovery is scheduled to close 90 days after a Special Master completes his review of the plaintiffs' objections to the defendant's privilege claims. That privilege review is ongoing. On August 18, 2023, the defendants filed objections to the Special Master's First Report and Recommendations with the Court. The Court overruled the defendants' objections on January 31, 2024. The Special Master has not indicated when he expects to complete his privilege review. On December 8, 2023, the Court granted final approval of the settlements the plaintiffs had reached with four of the original defendants (CBS, Fox, Cox Media, and ShareBuilders), who agreed to pay a total of million to settle the plaintiffs' claims against them. The Company and the other non-settling defendants continue to believe the lawsuits are without merit and intend to vigorously defend themselves against all such claims. 
 
 On July 19, 2023, as part of bankruptcy proceedings of DSG, an independently managed and unconsolidated subsidiary of Sinclair, DSG and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Diamond Sports Net, LLC, filed a complaint (the "Diamond Litigation"), under seal, in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas naming certain subsidiaries of Sinclair, including SBG and STG and certain officers of SBG and STG, as defendants.

 billion as a result of the alleged misconduct. The complaint asserted a variety of claims, including certain fraudulent transfers of assets, unlawful distributions and payments, breaches of contracts, unjust enrichment and breaches of fiduciary duties. The plaintiffs sought, among other relief, avoidance of fraudulent transfers and unlawful distributions, and unspecified monetary damages to be determined. 
 
 On March 1, 2024, the court approved a global settlement and release of all claims associated with the Diamond Litigation, which settlement included an amendment to the MSA. Sinclair entered into the settlement, without admitting any fault or wrongdoing. The settlement terms included, among other things, DSG's dismissal with prejudice of its billion litigation against Sinclair and all other defendants, along with the full and final satisfaction and release of all claims in that litigation against all defendants, including Sinclair and its subsidiaries, in exchange for Sinclair's cash payment to DSG of million. Additionally, under the terms of the settlement, Sinclair would provide transition services to DSG to allow DSG to become a self-standing entity going forward. During the first quarter of 2024, SBG paid million related to the settlement. The final settlement payment was made during the second quarter of 2024 and of the total million settlement amount paid, million was paid by STG and million was paid by Ventures. 
 
 As described under Note 3. Notes Payable, Finance Leases, and Commercial Bank Financing , SBG has provided a guarantee that requires SBG to provide funding to Marquee under certain circumstances. On July 19, 2024, Marquee sent SBG a funding notice seeking million under the Marquee guarantee by August 1, 2024 purportedly to make payments under certain agreements to affiliates of the Chicago Cubs, an affiliate of which is also a co-owner of Marquee. Based on the information provided to SBG by Marquee, Marquee has sufficient cash to make such payments without funding under the Marquee guarantee. For this and other reasons, SBG does not believe it is contractually required to provide funding under the Marquee guarantee at this time and have so informed Marquee. On August 2, 2024, Marquee sent SBG another letter claiming that SBG's failure to timely pay the amounts subject to Marquee's funding notice constitutes a breach of the Marquee guarantee and requesting payment of such amounts no later than August 17, 2024 at which time Marquee has stated it will pursue any and all available remedies pursuant to the Marquee guarantee. This dispute may result in litigation, and based on SBG's expectation of Marquee's claims, SBG believes that it has meritorious defenses and intends to vigorously defend against such claims.

 Any references to the first, second, or fourth quarters are to the three months ended March 31, June 30, or December 31, respectively, for the year being discussed. As of September 30, 2024, we had two reportable segments for accounting purposes, local media and tennis. 
 
 Seasonality / Cyclicality 
 
 The operating results of our local media segment are usually subject to cyclical fluctuations from political advertising. In even numbered years, political spending is usually significantly higher than in odd numbered years due to advertising expenditures preceding local and national elections. Additionally, every four years, political spending is usually elevated further due to advertising expenditures preceding the presidential election. Also, the second and fourth quarter operating results are usually higher than the first and third quarters' because advertising expenditures are increased in anticipation of certain seasonal and holiday spending by consumers. 
 
 The operating results of our tennis segment are usually subject to cyclical fluctuations due to the number and significance of tournaments that take place in the respective quarters during the year. The first and fourth quarter operating results are usually higher than the second and third quarters' because of the number and significance of tournaments that are played during those periods.

 Corporate general and administrative expenses. The table above and the explanation that follows cover total consolidated corporate general and administrative expenses. Corporate general and administrative expenses decreased 4 million and 16 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectfully, when compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to a decrease in legal, consulting, and regulatory costs, primarily related to the litigation discussed under Note 5. Commitments and Contingencies within Sinclair's Consolidated Financial Statements, partially offset by an increase in employee compensation cost. 
 
 Income tax (provision) benefit. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was a provision of 23.0 as compared to a benefit of 20.7 during the same period in 2023. The change from benefit to provision is primarily due to a book loss in 2023 compared to book income in 2024. 
 
 The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a provision of 17.4 as compared to a benefit of 134.3 during the same period in 2023. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, is primarily due to a release of the 2023 valuation allowance on deferred tax assets relating to deductibility of interest expense under the IRC Section 163(j) as a result of the change in the tax classification of the legal entity owning the DSG business because of the exit of the sole minority investor.

 Any references to the first, second, or fourth quarters are to the three months ended March 31, June 30, or December 31, respectively, for the year being discussed. As of September 30, 2024, SBG had one reportable segment for accounting purposes, local media. 
 
 Seasonality / Cyclicality 
 
 The operating results of SBG's local media segment are usually subject to cyclical fluctuations from political advertising. In even numbered years, political spending is usually significantly higher than in odd numbered years due to advertising expenditures preceding local and national elections. Additionally, every four years, political spending is usually elevated further due to advertising expenditures preceding the presidential election. Also, the second and fourth quarter operating results are usually higher than the first and third quarters' because advertising expenditures are increased in anticipation of certain seasonal and holiday spending by consumers.

The decrease in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, is primarily due to a release of the 2023 valuation allowance on deferred tax assets relating to deductibility of interest expense under the IRC Section 163(j) as a result of the change in the tax classification of the legal entity owning the DSG business because of the exit of the sole minority investor.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, Sinclair had net working capital of approximately 646 million, including 536 million in cash and cash equivalent balances, and 650 million of available borrowing capacity. Cash on hand, cash generated by Sinclair's operations, and borrowing capacity under the Bank Credit Agreement are used as Sinclair's primary sources of liquidity. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, SBG had net working capital of approximately 238 million, including 202 million in cash and cash equivalent balances, and 650 million of available borrowing capacity. Cash on hand, cash generated by SBG's operations, and borrowing capacity under the Bank Credit Agreement are used as SBG's primary sources of liquidity. 
 
 The Bank Credit Agreement of STG, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SBG, includes a financial maintenance covenant, the first lien leverage ratio (as defined in the Bank Credit Agreement), which requires such ratio not to exceed 4.5x, measured as of the end of each fiscal quarter, which is only applicable if 35 or more of the capacity (as a percentage of total commitments) under the revolving credit facility, measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, is utilized under the revolving credit facility as of such date. Since there was no utilization under the revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2024, STG was not subject to the financial maintenance covenant under the Bank Credit Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, the STG first lien leverage ratio was below 4.5x. The Bank Credit Agreement contains other restrictions and covenants with which STG was in compliance as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, STG purchased 27 million aggregate principal amount of the Term Loan B-2, due September 30, 2026, for consideration of 25 million. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Sinclair and SBG entered into agreements which increased estimated contractual amounts owed for network programming rights by 1,592 million which have terms that extend into 2027. There were no other material changes to Sinclair's or SBG's contractual cash obligations as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Sinclair and SBG anticipate that existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from the local media segment's operations, and borrowing capacity under the Bank Credit Agreement will be sufficient to satisfy the local media segment's debt service obligations, capital expenditure requirements, and working capital needs for the next twelve months. Sinclair anticipates that existing cash and cash equivalents and cash flow from SBG, the tennis segment and other's operations will be sufficient to satisfy SBG's, the tennis segment and other's debt service obligations, capital expenditure requirements, and working capital needs for the next twelve months. However, certain factors, including but not limited to the war in Ukraine, conflict in the Middle East, and other geopolitical matters, natural disasters, and pandemics, and their resulting effect on the economy, Sinclair's and SBG's advertisers, and Sinclair's and SBG's Distributors and their subscribers, could affect Sinclair's and SBG's liquidity and first lien leverage ratio which could affect Sinclair's and SBG's ability to access the full borrowing capacity under the Bank Credit Agreement. In addition to the sources described above, Sinclair and SBG may rely upon various sources for long-term liquidity needs, such as but not limited to, the issuance of long-term debt, the issuance of Sinclair equity, for Sinclair only, the issuance of Ventures equity or debt, or other instruments convertible into or exchangeable for Sinclair equity, or the sale of assets. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing or capital or buyers of assets will be available, or that the terms of any transactions will be acceptable or advantageous to Sinclair or SBG. 
 
 In January 2024, Sinclair announced that it had agreed to a global settlement and release of all claims associated with the litigation filed by DSG and DSG s wholly-owned subsidiary, Diamond Sports Net, LLC, in July 2023 and on March 1, 2024, the court approved the settlement. The settlement terms included Sinclair s cash payment to DSG of 495 million. Additionally, under the terms of the settlement, Sinclair would provide transition services to DSG to allow DSG to become a self-standing entity going forward. An initial payment of 50 million was made in the first quarter of 2024 and the remaining 445 million was paid in the second quarter of 2024. Of the total 495 million settlement amount paid, 347 million was paid by STG and 148 million was paid by Ventures.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Each of Sinclair's and SBG's management, under the supervision and with the participation of its respective Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the design and effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 The term "disclosure controls and procedures," as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 
 Assessment of Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Based on the evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, each of Sinclair's and SBG's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, Sinclair's and SBG's disclosure controls and procedures, respectively, were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no changes in either Sinclair's or SBG's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.

 Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 
 
 Management, including each of Sinclair's and SBG's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that Sinclair's and SBG's disclosure controls and procedures or its internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within each company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management's override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

 (ii) Discretionary Bonus .
