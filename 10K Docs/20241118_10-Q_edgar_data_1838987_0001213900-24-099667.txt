SPECIAL
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

Certain
statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the federal
securities laws. Our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our and our management team s
expectations, hopes, beliefs, intentions or strategies regarding the future. In addition, any statements that refer to projections, forecasts
or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. The
words anticipate, believe, continue, could, estimate, expect, 
 intends, may, might, plan, possible, potential, predict, 
 project, should, will, would and similar expressions may identify forward-looking
statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. 

our ability to recognize
 the anticipated benefits of the Business Combination (as defined below), which may be affected by, among other things, competition
 and our ability to grow and manage growth profitably following the closing of the Business Combination; 

our financial and business
 performance following the Business Combination, including financial projections and business metrics; 

changes in our strategy,
 future operations, financial position, estimated revenues and losses, projected costs, prospects and plans; 

our ability to meet the
 expectations of new and current customers, and our ability to achieve market acceptance for our products; 

our expectations and forecasts
 with respect to market opportunity and market growth; 

our ability to leverage our acquisition under the asset purchase agreement with SunPower Corporation and other acquisitions, including our ability to integrate acquired businesses, to fund and meet the liquidity needs of the acquired businesses, to retain key employees of the acquired businesses, to take advantage of growth opportunities and to realize the expected benefits of such acquisitions; 

the ability of our products
 and services to meet customers compliance and regulatory needs; 

our ability to attract
 and retain qualified employees and management; 

our ability to develop
 and maintain its brand and reputation; 

developments and projections
 relating to our competitors and industry; 

changes
 in general economic and financial conditions, inflationary pressures and the resulting impact demand, and our ability to plan for
 and respond to the impact of those changes; 

our
 expectations regarding our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection and not infringe on the rights of others; 

our future capital requirements
 and sources and uses of cash; 

our ability to obtain funding for our operations and future growth, including in connection with the integration of our acquisitions; and 

our business, expansion
 plans and opportunities. 

Actual
events or results may differ from those expressed in forward-looking statements. You should not rely on forward-looking statements as
predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q primarily
on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition
and operating results. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties and
other factors described in the section titled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Moreover,
we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not
possible for us to predict all risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The results, events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements may not be achieved
or occur, and actual results, events or circumstances could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. 

In
addition, statements that we believe and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These
statements are based on information available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. While we believe that information
provides a reasonable basis for these statements, that information may be limited or incomplete. Our statements should not be read to
indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain,
and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely on these statements. 

The
forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are
made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to reflect events
or circumstances after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated
events, except as required by law. We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking
statements, and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements do not reflect
the potential impact of any future acquisitions, mergers, dispositions, joint ventures or investments.

SUMMARY
RISK FACTORS 

Our management has identified
 conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

Our business depends in
 part on the availability of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives. The expiration, elimination or reduction of these
 rebates, credits or incentives or the ability to monetize them could adversely impact the business. 

Existing regulations and
 policies and changes to these regulations and policies may present technical, regulatory, and economic barriers to the purchase and
 use of solar power products, which may significantly reduce demand for our products and services. 

Risks associated with a
 highly complex global supply chain, including from disruptions, delays, trade tensions, or shortages. 

We rely on net metering
 and related policies to offer competitive pricing to customers in many of our current markets and changes to net metering policies
 may significantly reduce demand for electricity from residential solar energy systems. 

We utilize a limited number
 of suppliers of solar panels and other system components to adequately meet anticipated demand for our solar service offerings. Any
 shortage, delay or component price change from these suppliers or delays and price increases associated with the product transport
 logistics could result in sales and installation delays, cancellations, and loss of market share. 

We provide warranties for
 solar system installations, solar panels, and other system components that may negatively impact overall profitability. 

We utilize third-party
 sales and installation partners whose performance could result in sales and installation delays, cancellations, and loss of market
 share. 

Risks associated with solar
 system installation and connection delays, including the potential for recoupment or clawback of payments by financing partners. 

Due to the general economic
 environment and any market pressure that would drive down the average selling prices of solar power products, among other factors,
 we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund operations and make adequate
 capital investments as planned. 

Our business substantially
 focuses on solar service agreements and transactions with residential customers. 

We have incurred losses
 and may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability in the future. 

Our business is concentrated
 in certain markets, including California, putting us at risk of region-specific disruptions. 

We depend on a limited
 number of customers and sales contracts for a significant portion of revenues, and the loss of any customer or cancellation of any
 contract may cause significant fluctuations or declines in revenues. 

We may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, including the transactions under the SunPower Asset Purchase Agreement, and integration of these acquisitions may disrupt our business. 

We have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting. If we cannot maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, the accuracy and timeliness of our financial and operating reporting may be adversely affected, and confidence in our operations and disclosures may be lost. 

Servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt. 

The conversion features of the Convertible Senior Notes may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. 

Conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes may dilute the ownership interest of our stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.

Notes
to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

. Through February 2022, the Company operated as a single legal entity as Complete Solar,
Inc. In February 2022, the Company implemented a holding company reorganization (the Reorganization in which the Company
created and incorporated Complete Solar Holding Corporation Complete Solar Holdings ). As a result of the Reorganization,
Complete Solar Holdings became the successor entity to Complete Solar, Inc. The capitalization structure was not changed because of the
Reorganization as all shares of Complete Solar, Inc. common stock and preferred stock were exchanged on a one for one basis with shares
of Complete Solar Holdings common stock and preferred stock. The Reorganization was accounted for as a change in reporting entity for
entities under common control. The historical assets and liabilities of Complete Solar, Inc. were transferred to Complete Solar Holdings
at their carrying value, and there were no changes to net loss, other comprehensive loss, or any related per share amounts reported in
the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requiring retrospective application. 

In
October 2022, the Company entered into a business combination agreement, as amended on December 26, 2022 and January 17, 2023 Original
Business Combination Agreement and as amended on May 26, 2023 Amended and Restated Business Combination Agreement ),
with Jupiter Merger Sub I Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Freedom Acquisition I Corp. FACT ( First Merger Sub ), Jupiter Merger Sub II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of FACT Second Merger Sub ), Complete Solar Holding Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and Solaria, a Delaware corporation. 

The
transactions contemplated by the Amended and Restated Business Combination Agreement were consummated on July 18, 2023 Closing
Date ). Following the consummation of the Merger on the Closing Date, FACT changed its name to Complete Solaria, Inc. 

As
part of the transactions contemplated by the Amended and Restated Business Combination Agreement, FACT effected a deregistration under
the Cayman Islands Companies Act and a domestication under Section 388 of the Delaware s General Corporation Law (the DGCL 
or Domestication ). On the Closing Date, following the Domestication, First Merger Sub merged with and into Complete Solaria,
with Complete Solaria surviving such merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of FACT (the First Merger ), and immediately following
the First Merger, Complete Solaria merged with and into Second Merger Sub, with Second Merger Sub surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary
of FACT (the Second Merger ), and Second Merger Sub changed its name to CS, LLC, and immediately following the Second Merger,
Solaria merged with and into a newly formed Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of FACT and changed its name
to The Solaria Corporation LLC Third Merger Sub ), with Third Merger Sub surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of FACT
(the Additional Merger , and together with the First Merger and the Second Merger, the Mergers ). 

In
connection with the closing of the Mergers: 

Each share of the Company s capital stock, inclusive of shares converted from the 2022 Convertible Notes, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Closing Legacy Complete Solaria Capital Stock were cancelled and exchanged into an aggregate of shares of Complete Solaria Common Stock.

In
November 2022, Complete Solar Holdings acquired Solaria and changed its name to Complete Solaria, Inc. On August 18, 2023, the Company
entered into a Non-Binding Letter of Intent to sell certain of Complete Solaria s North American solar panel assets to Maxeon,
Inc. Maxeon ). In October 2023, the Company completed the sale of its solar panel business to Maxeon. Refer to Note 1(b)
 Divestiture and Note 7 Divestiture. 

(b)
Divestiture 

In
October 2023, the Company completed the sale of its solar panel business to Maxeon, pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement
(the Disposal Agreement ). Under the terms of the Disposal Agreement, Maxeon agreed to acquire certain assets and employees
of Complete Solaria, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million consisting of shares of Maxeon ordinary
shares. The Company sold all its Maxeon shares in 2023 resulting in a loss of million which was recorded within continuing operations
in the Company s consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

7 

million and 
million during the thirteen-weeks ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, respectively, net losses from continuing operations
of million and million during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, respectively, and
had an accumulated deficit of million and debt and derivative liabilities of million as of September 29, 2024. The
Company had cash and cash equivalents of million, excluding restricted cash of million, as of September 29, 2024. The
cash on hand was obtained as a result of additional funding as disclosed in Note 13 Borrowings and Derivative Liabilities. Subsequent
to September 29, 2024, the Company used million to complete the acquisition described in Note 20 Subsequent Events.
The Company believes that its operating losses and negative operating cash flows will continue into the foreseeable future. These conditions
raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

Management obtained additional funding and restructured
its debt in the period ended September 29, 2024, as summarized in Note 13 Borrowings and Derivative Liabilities. Historically,
the Company s activities have been financed through private placements of equity securities, debt and proceeds from the Merger.
If the Company is not able to secure adequate additional funding when needed, the Company will need to reevaluate its operating plan and
may be forced to make reductions in spending, extend payment terms with suppliers, liquidate assets where possible, or suspend or curtail
planned programs or cease operations entirely. These actions could materially impact the Company s business, results of operations
and future prospects. While the Company has been able to raise multiple rounds of financing, there can be no assurance that in the event
the Company requires additional financing, such financing will be available on terms that are favorable, or at all. Failure to generate
sufficient cash flows from operations, raise additional capital or reduce certain discretionary spending would have a material adverse
effect on the Company s ability to achieve its intended business objectives. 

Therefore,
there is substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that these
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been issued. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
have been prepared assuming the Company will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and
settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. They do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects
on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from uncertainty
related to its ability to continue as a going concern.

aggregate total Shares that may be purchased under the FPAs shall be no more than in aggregate, less, in the case of Meteora

may not beneficially own greater than 9.9 of issued and outstanding Shares following the Mergers as per the Amended and Restated Business
Combination Agreement. 

The
key terms of the forward contracts are as follows: 

The FPA Sellers can terminate the transaction following the Optional Early Termination OET Date which shall specify the quantity by which the number of shares is to be reduced (such quantity, the Terminated Shares ). Seller shall terminate the transaction in respect of any shares sold on or prior to the maturity date. The counterparty is entitled to an amount from the Seller equal to the number of terminated shares multiplied by a reset price. The reset price is initially (the Initial Price and is subject to a floor. 

The FPA contains multiple settlement outcomes. Per the terms of the agreements, the FPAs will (1) settle in cash in the event the Company is due cash upon settlement from the FPA Sellers or (2) settle in either cash or shares, at the discretion of the Company, should the settlement amount adjustment exceed the settlement amount. Should the Company elect to settle via shares, the equity will be issued in Complete Solaria Common Stock, with a per share price based on the volume-weighted average price VWAP Price over 15 scheduled trading days. The magnitude of the settlement is based on the Settlement Amount, an amount equal to the product of: (1) Number of shares issued to the FPA Seller pursuant to the FPA, less the number of Terminated Shares multiplied by (2) the VWAP Price over the valuation period. The Settlement amount will be reduced by the Settlement Adjustment, an amount equal to the product of (1) Number of shares in the Pricing Date Notice, less the number of Terminated Shares multiplied by . 

The Settlement occurs as

 Mergers (b) the date specified by Seller in a written notice to be delivered to the Counterparty at the Seller s discretion
 (which Valuation Date shall not be earlier than the day such notice is effective) after the occurrence of certain triggering events;
 and (c) 90 days after delivery by the Counterparty of a written notice in the event that for any 20 trading days during a 30 consecutive
 trading day-period (the Measurement Period that occurs at least 6 months after the Closing Date, the VWAP Price is
 less than the then applicable Reset Price. 

The Company entered into four separate FPAs, three
of which, associated with the obligation to issue Shares, were entered into prior to the closing of the Mergers. Upon signing
the FPAs, the Company incurred an obligation to issue a fixed number of shares to the FPA Sellers contingent upon the closing of the Mergers
in addition to the terms and conditions associated with the settlement of the FPAs. The Company accounted for the contingent obligation
to issue shares in accordance with ASC 815 and recorded a liability and Other expense, net based on the fair value upon of the obligation
upon the signing of the FPAs. The liability was extinguished in July 2023 upon the issuance of Complete Solaria Common Stock to the FPA
sellers. 

Additionally, in accordance with ASC 480, the Company
has determined that the forward contracts are financial instruments other than shares that represent or are indexed to obligations to
repurchase the issuer s equity shares by transferring assets, referred to herein as the forward purchase liability 
on its unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company initially measured the forward purchase liabilities at fair value
and has subsequently remeasured them at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. 

On
December 18, 2023, the Company and the FPA Sellers entered into separate amendments to the FPAs (the Amendments ). The Amendments
lower the reset floor price of each FPA from to and allow the Company to raise up to million of equity from existing
stockholders without triggering certain anti-dilution provisions contained in the FPAs; provided, the insiders pay a price per share
for their initial investment equal to the closing price per share as quoted on the Nasdaq on the day of purchase; provided, further,
that any subsequent investments are made at a price per share equal to the greater of (a) the closing price per share as quoted by Nasdaq
on the day of the purchase or (b) the amount paid in connection with the initial investment.

Company executes similar amendments with both Polar and Meteora. 

On June 14, 2024, the Company entered into
and executed an amendment to the FPA with Sandia (the Sandia Third Amendment ). The Sandia Third Amendment set the
reset price of each FPA to per share and amended the VWAP Trigger Event provision to read as After December 31, 2024,

an additional shares of the Company s common stock related to an anti-dilution provision within the CS Solis Debt that
provides for such additional warrants under such circumstances as provided within the CS Solis Debt. 

At

average assumptions: expected term of years; expected volatility of ; risk-free interest rate of ; and no dividend yield.
The fair value of the warrant was initially recorded within additional paid-in capital as it met the conditions for equity classification. 

In
July 2023, and in connection with the closing of the Mergers, the Carlyle debt and warrants were modified. Based on the exchange ratio
included in the Mergers, the outstanding warrants to purchase Legacy Complete Solaria Common Stock prior to modification were
exchanged into warrants to purchase shares of Complete Solaria Common Stock. As part of the modification, the warrant, which

vesting ten days after the date of the agreement and warrants vesting thirty days after the date of the agreement were exercisable

The modification of the warrant resulted in the reclassification of
previously equity-classified warrants to liability classification, which was accounted for in accordance with ASC 815 and ASC 718, Compensation
 Stock Compensation . The Company recorded the fair value of the modified warrants as a warrant liability of million,
the pre-modification fair value of the warrants as a reduction to additional paid-in capital of million and an expense of million
to Other expense, net in the thirteen week period ended October 1, 2023, equal to the incremental value of the warrants upon the modification.
The fair value of the warrant was determined based on its intrinsic value, given a nominal exercise price. At issuance, the relative fair
value of the warrant was determined to be million using the Black-Scholes model with the following weighted average assumptions:
expected term of years; expected volatility of ; risk-free interest rate of ; and no dividend yield. 

On July 1, 2024, in connection with the Exchange Agreement (as defined
in Note 13 Borrowings and Derivative Liabilities), the Carlyle warrant was modified, and the modification fixed the number of
shares of the Company s common stock that may be issued upon exercise of the Carlyle warrant at . At the modification date,
the Carlyle warrant had a fair value of million. The modification of the warrant resulted in the reclassification of previously classified

the warrant liability of million, and million of expense related to the remeasurement of the liability as of the modification
date which was classified within Gain on Extinguishment of Debt within the Company s statements of operations for
the thirteen weeks and thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024.

arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount
of the loss can be reasonably estimated. If the Company determines that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can
be reasonably estimated, the Company discloses the reasonably possible loss. The Company adjusts its accruals to reflect the impact of
negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. Legal costs
are expensed as incurred. Although claims are inherently unpredictable, the Company is not aware of any matters that may have a material
adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The Company has recorded million as a loss
contingency in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on its unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets as of both September 29,
2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

SolarPark
Litigation 

In
January 2023, SolarPark Korea Co., LTD SolarPark demanded approximately million during discussions between the
Company and SolarPark. In February 2023, the Company submitted its statement of claim seeking approximately million in damages
against SolarPark. The ultimate outcome of this arbitration is currently unknown and could result in a material liability to the Company.
However, the Company believes that the allegations lack merit and intends to vigorously defend all claims asserted. No liability has
been recorded in the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as the likelihood of a loss is not probable
at this time. 

34 

million in damages. 

On May 11, 2023, SolarPark filed a motion for
preliminary injunction to seek an order restraining the Company from using or disclosing SolarPark s purported trade secrets, making
or selling shingled modules other than those produced by SolarPark, and from soliciting solar module manufacturers to produce shingled
modules using Solaria s shingled patents. On May 18, 2023, the Company responded by filing a motion for partial dismissal and stay.
On May 25, 2023, the Company filed an opposition to SolarPark s motion for a preliminary injunction. On June 1, 2023, SolarPark
filed an opposition to the Company s motion for dismissal and stay and a reply in support of their motion for preliminary injunction.
On June 8, 2023, the Company replied in support of its motion for partial dismissal and stay. On July 11, 2023, the court conducted a
hearing to consider SolarPark and the Company s respective motions. On August 2, 2023, the court issued a ruling, which granted
the preliminary injunction motion with respect to any purported misappropriation of SolarPark s purported trade secrets and ordering
that the Company produce documents and communications exchanged between the Company and any manufacturer or potential manufacturer that
describe or reference any of SolarPark s mass-production trade secrets, as identified by SolarPark in the case. The court s
ruling does not prohibit the Company from producing shingled modules or from utilizing its own patents for the manufacture of shingled
modules. The court denied SolarPark s motion seeking a defamation injunction. The court denied the Company s motion to dismiss
and granted the Company s motion to stay the entire litigation pending the arbitration in Singapore. On September 1, 2023, the Company
filed a Limited Notice of Appeal to appeal the August 2023 order granting SolarPark s motion for preliminary injunction. On September
26, 2023, the Company filed a Notice of Withdrawal of Appeal and will not appeal the Court s Preliminary Injunction Order. Between
August 2023 and March 2024, the parties were engaged in discovery negotiations and the Company produced documents to SolarPark. The Company
produced its last set of documents on March 14, 2024. Since then, SolarPark has been reviewing the documents and the case has remained
stayed. 

No
liability has been recorded in the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as the likelihood of a loss
is not probable at this time. 

Siemens
Litigation 

On
July 22, 2021, Siemens Government Technologies, Inc. Siemens Government Technologies filed a lawsuit against Solaria
Corporation in Fairfax Circuit Court (the Court in Fairfax, Virginia. On July 27, 2023, Siemens Government Technologies,
moved to amend the complaint to add Siemens Industry Inc. as a co-plaintiff. This motion was granted on August 25, 2023. On October 23,
2023, Siemens Government Technologies and Siemens Industry Inc. (collectively, Siemens and Solaria Corporation stipulated
to add SolarCA, LLC as a co-defendant. Solaria Corporation and SolarCA, LLC (collectively, the Subsidiaries are both wholly-owned
subsidiaries of Complete Solaria, Inc. In the lawsuit, Siemens alleged that the Subsidiaries breached express and implied warranties
under a purchase order that Siemens placed with the Subsidiaries for a solar module system. Siemens claimed damages of approximately
 million, inclusive of amounts of the Subsidiaries indemnity obligations to Siemens, plus attorneys fees. 

On
February 22, 2024, the Court issued an order against the Subsidiaries which awards Siemens approximately million, inclusive of amounts
of the Subsidiaries indemnity obligations to Siemens, plus attorney s fees, the amount of which would be determined at a
later hearing. On March 15, 2024, Siemens filed a motion seeking to recover million for attorneys fees, expenses, and pre-
and post-judgment interest. The Company opposed Siemens motion for attorneys fees, expenses, and pre- and post-judgment
interest on April 5, 2024. On June 17, 2024, the Court entered a final order which awards Siemens a total of million in attorneys 
fees and costs. The Company has appealed these judgments. 

The Company recognized million as a legal loss related to this
litigation in 2023, and in 2024, the Company recorded an additional accrual for million for attorneys fees, expenses, and
pre-judgment interest, in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on its unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets as of
September 29, 2024. This legal loss was recognized in loss from discontinued operations, net of tax on the unaudited condensed consolidated
statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The Company recorded million as a legal loss related to this litigation, excluding
amounts for attorneys fees and costs, in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on its unaudited condensed consolidated
balance sheet as of December 31, 2023. 

35 

million of outstanding letters of credit related to normal business transactions as of September 29, 2024. These agreements
require the Company to maintain specified amounts of cash as collateral in segregated accounts to support the letters of credit issued
thereunder. As discussed in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, the cash collateral in these restricted cash accounts
was million at each of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

which million was issued to five related parties. Additionally, the Company acquired a related party convertible note, on the same
terms as the 2022 Convertible Notes as part of the acquisition of Solaria, with a fair value of million at the time of the acquisition.
The 2022 Convertible Notes accrued interest at a rate of per annum. Immediately prior to the closing of the Mergers, the 2022 Convertible
Notes were converted into the number of shares of common stock of Complete Solaria equal to (x) the principal amount together with all
accrued interest of the 2022 Convertible Notes divided by 0.75, divided by (y) the price of a share of common stock of Complete Solaria
used to determine the conversion ratio in the Amended and Restated Business Combination Agreement. This resulted in the issuance of 
shares of Complete Solaria common stock to the noteholders and no debt remains outstanding associated with the 2022 Convertible Notes
as of December 31, 2023. For the thirteen week periods ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, the Company recognized and less
than million, respectively, in interest expense related to the related party 2022 Convertible Notes. For the thirty-nine week periods

PIPE proceeds noted above, the Company received additional PIPE proceeds from related parties of million. In July 2023, in connection
with the Mergers, the Company issued shares to a related party as a transaction bonus. Refer to Note 1(a) Description
of Business and Note 4 Reverse Recapitalization for further discussion. 

In
July 2023, the Company entered into a series of FPAs as described in Note 5 Forward Purchase Agreements. In connection with the
FPAs, the Company recognized other expense of million for each of the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended October 1, 2023
in connection with the issuance of shares of the Company s common stock to the related party FPA Sellers. The Company
recognized other income of million in connection with the issuance of the FPAs with related parties. 

The
Company has recognized an asset associated with the FPAs of million and a liability of million due to related parties in its
unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The change in fair value
of the forward purchase liabilities with related parties amounted to income of million for the thirteen weeks ended September 29,
2024, and million for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024, respectively. The change in the fair value of the forward
purchase liabilities with related parties amounted to expense of million for the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended October
1, 2023. 

In
September 2023, in connection with the Mergers, the Company entered into a settlement and release agreement with a related party for
the settlement of a working capital loan made to the Sponsor, prior to the closing of the Mergers. As part of the settlement agreement,
the Company agreed to pay the related party million as a return of capital, which is paid in ten equal monthly installments and

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

You
should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our audited consolidated
financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on
April 1, 2024, and related management s discussion and analysis in Item 7 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains
forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below.
Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those identified below and those discussed in the section titled Risk
Factors included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Please also see the section titled Special Note Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements. 

Overview 

Complete
Solaria was formed in November 2022 through the merger of Complete Solar Holding Corporation, a Delaware corporation Complete
Solar ), and The Solaria Corporation, a Delaware corporation (such entity, Solaria, and such transaction, the Business
Combination ). Founded in 2010, Complete Solar created a technology platform to offer clean energy products to homeowners by enabling
a national network of sales partners and build partners. Our sales partners generate solar installation contracts with homeowners on
our behalf. To facilitate this process, we provide the software tools, sales support and brand identity to its sales partners, making
them competitive with national providers. This turnkey solution makes it easy for anyone to sell solar. 

We fulfill our customer contracts by engaging with local construction
specialists. We manage the customer experience and complete all pre-construction activities prior to delivering build-ready projects including
hardware, engineering plans, and building permits to its builder partners. We manage and coordinate this process through our proprietary
HelioTrack TM software system. We impaired the value of our HelioTrack TM software as this software has no future
use following the completion of the migration to software acquired as part of the SunPower acquisition. Refer to Note 20 Subsequent
Events in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for a further description of the SunPower acquisition. 

Our
fiscal quarters are thirteen-week periods within a standard calendar year. Each annual reporting period begins on January 1 and ends
on December 31. 

There
is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements are issued. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we
will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities in the normal
course of business. They do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification
of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from uncertainty related to our ability to continue as a
going concern. 

Growth
Strategy and Outlook 

Complete
Solaria s growth strategy contains the following elements: 

Increase revenue by
 expanding installation capacity and developing new geographic markets - We continue to expand our network of partners who will
 install systems resulting from sales generated by our sales partners. By leveraging this network of skilled builders, we aim to increase
 our installation capacity in our traditional markets and expand our offering into new geographies throughout the United States. This
 will enable greater sales growth in existing markets and create new revenue in expansion markets. 

Increase revenue and
 margin by engaging national-scale sales partners - We aim to offer a turnkey solar solution to prospective sales partners with
 a national footprint. These sales partners include electric vehicle manufacturers, national home security providers, and real estate
 brokerages. We expect to create a consistent offering with a single execution process for such sales partners throughout their geographic
 territories. These national accounts have unique customer relationships that we believe will facilitate meaningful sales opportunities
 and low cost of acquisition to both increase revenue and improve margin.

The
Mergers 

We
entered into an Amended and Restated Business Combination Agreement with Jupiter Merger Sub I Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Freedom Acquisition I Corp. FACT ( First Merger Sub ), Jupiter Merger Sub II LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of FACT Second Merger Sub ), and Solaria on October 3, 2022 Merger ).
The Merger was consummated on July 18, 2023. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger, (i) First Merger Sub
merged with and into Complete Solaria with Complete Solaria surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of FACT (the First Merger ),
(ii) immediately thereafter and as part of the same overall transaction, Complete Solaria merged with and into Second Merger Sub,
with Second Merger Sub surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of FACT (the Second Merger ), and FACT changed its name to
 Complete Solaria, Inc. and Second Merger Sub changed its name to CS, LLC and (iii) immediately after
the consummation of the Second Merger and as part of the same overall transaction, Solaria merged with and into a newly formed Delaware
limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of FACT and changed its name to The SolarCA LLC Third Merger
Sub ), with Third Merger Sub surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of FACT (the Additional Merger , and together
with the First Merger and the Second Merger, the Mergers ). 

The
Mergers between Complete Solaria and FACT has been accounted for as a reverse recapitalization. Under this method of accounting, FACT
is treated as the acquired company for financial statement reporting purposes. This determination was primarily based on us having a
majority of the voting power of the post-combination company, our senior management comprising substantially all of the senior management
of the post-combination company, and our operations comprising the ongoing operations of the post-combination company. Accordingly, for
accounting purposes, the Mergers have been treated as the equivalent of a capital transaction in which Complete Solaria is issuing stock
for the net assets of FACT. The net assets of FACT have been stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. 

Disposal
Transaction 

In
October 2023, we completed the sale of our solar panel business Disposal Transaction to Maxeon, Inc. Maxeon ),
pursuant to the terms of an asset purchase agreement Disposal Agreement ). Under the terms of the Disposal Agreement, Maxeon
agreed to acquire certain assets and employees of Complete Solaria, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 11.0 million consisting
of 1,100,000 shares of Maxeon ordinary shares. 

As
part of the Disposal Transaction, we determined that the criteria were met for the held for sale and discontinued operations
classifications as of the end of our third fiscal quarter in 2023 as the divestiture represented a strategic shift in our business. We
recorded an impairment charge of 147.5 million associated with the recording of the assets as held for sale during the year ended December
31, 2023. 

As
of December 31, 2023, we had sold all the shares of Maxeon and recorded a loss of 4.2 million attributable to the sale of this investment. 

Below,
we have discussed our historical results of continuing operations which excludes product revenues and related metrics of our solar panel
business, as all results of operations associated with the solar panel business have been presented as discontinued operations, unless
otherwise noted. 

Key
Financial Definitions/Components of Results of Operations 

Revenues 

We
generate revenue by providing customer solar solutions through a standardized platform to our residential solar providers and companies
to facilitate the sale and installation of solar energy systems. Our contracts consist of two performance obligations: solar installation
services and post-installation services that are performed prior to inspection by the authority having jurisdiction. The majority of
our service revenue is recognized at a point in time upon the completion of the installation and the remainder is recognized upon inspection.
Service revenue is recognized net of a reserve for the performance guarantee of solar output. 

40 

We
enter into three types of customer contracts for solar energy installations. The majority of our service revenue is recognized through
contracts where the homeowner enters into a power purchase agreement with our distribution partner. We perform the solar energy installation
services on behalf of our distribution partner, who owns the solar energy system upon installation. Additionally, we enter into a Solar
Purchase and Installation Agreement directly with homeowners, whereby the homeowner either pays cash or obtains financing through a third-party
loan partner. In cash contracts with homeowners, we recognize service revenue based on the price we charge to the homeowner. We record
service revenue in the amount received from the financing partner, net of any financing fees charged to the homeowner, which we consider
to be a customer incentive. 

As
part of our service revenue, we also enter into contracts to provide our software enhanced service offerings, including design and proposal
services, to customers that include solar installers and solar sales organizations. We perform these leveraging our HelioQuote TM
 platform and other software tools to create computer aided drawings, structural letters, and electrical reviews for installers
and proposals for installers. We charge a fixed fee per service offering, which we recognize in the period the service is performed. 

Operating
Expenses 

Cost
of Revenues 

Cost
of revenues consists primarily of the cost of solar energy systems, installation and other subcontracting costs. Cost of revenues also
includes associated warranty costs, shipping and handling and allocated overhead costs. 

Sales
Commissions 

Sales
commissions are direct and incremental costs of obtaining customer contracts. These costs are paid to third-party vendors who source
residential customer contracts for the sale of solar energy systems. 

Sales
and Marketing 

Sales
and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel related costs, including salaries and employee benefits, stock-based compensation,
and other promotional and advertising expenses. We expense certain sales and marketing, including promotional expenses, as incurred. 

General
and Administrative 

General
and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses for our employees, in our finance, research, engineering,
and administrative teams including salaries, bonuses, payroll taxes, and stock-based compensation. It also consists of legal, consulting,
and professional fees, rent expenses pertaining to our offices, business insurance costs, depreciation and amortization of internally
developed software, investor relations and other costs. We expect an increase in audit, tax, accounting, legal and other costs related
to compliance with applicable securities and other regulations, as well as additional insurance, investor relations, and other costs
associated with being a public company. 

Interest
Expense 

Interest
expense primarily relates to interest expense on the issuance of debt and convertible notes and the amortization of debt issuance costs. 

Other Expense, Net 

Other expense, net consists
of loss on issuance and remeasurement of derivative liability, changes in the fair value of forward purchase agreements and warrant liabilities,
loss on the conversion of two SAFE Agreements to shares of common stock, and other costs. 

Income
Tax Expense 

Income
tax expense primarily consists of income taxes in certain foreign and state jurisdictions in which we conduct business. 

41 

Supply
Chain Constraints and Risk 

We
rely on a small number of suppliers of solar energy systems and other equipment. If any of our suppliers was unable or unwilling to provide
us with contracted quantities in a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, we would have very limited alternatives
for supply, and we may not be able find suitable replacements for our customers, or at all. Such an event could materially adversely
affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. 

In
addition, the global supply chain and our industry have experienced significant disruptions in recent periods. We have seen supply chain
challenges and logistics constraints increase, including shortages of panels, inverters, batteries and associated component parts for
inverters and solar energy systems available for purchase, which materially impacted our results of operations. In an effort to mitigate
unpredictable lead times, we experienced a substantial build up in inventory on hand commencing in early 2022 in response to global supply
chain constraints. In certain cases, the global supply chain constraints have caused delays in critical equipment and inventory, longer
lead times, and has resulted in cost volatility. These shortages and delays can be attributed in part to the residual effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic and resulting government action, as well as broader macroeconomic conditions, and have been exacerbated by the conflicts
in Ukraine and Israel. While we believe that a majority our suppliers have secured sufficient supply to permit them to continue delivery
and installations through the end of March 2025, if these shortages and delays persist, they could adversely affect the timing of when
battery energy storage systems can be delivered and installed, and when (or if) we can begin to generate revenue from those systems.
If any of our suppliers of solar modules experienced disruptions in the supply of the modules component parts, for example semiconductor
solar wafers or inverters, this may decrease production capabilities and restrict our inventory and sales. In addition, we have experienced
and are experiencing varying levels of volatility in costs of equipment and labor resulting in part from disruptions caused by general
global economic conditions. While inflationary pressures have resulted in higher costs of products, in part due to an increase in the
cost of the materials and wage rates, these additional costs have been offset by the related rise in electricity rates. 

We
cannot predict the full effects the supply chain constraints will have on our business, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition and
results of operations at this time due to numerous uncertainties. Given the dynamic nature of these circumstances on our ongoing business,
results of operations and overall financial performance, the full impact of macroeconomic factors, including the conflicts in Ukraine
and Israel, cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. In the event we are unable to mitigate the impact of delays or price volatility
in solar energy systems, raw materials, and freight, it could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition
and results of operations. For additional information on risk factors that could impact our results, please refer to Risk Factors 
located elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe
to be reasonable under the circumstances. In many instances, we could have reasonably used different accounting estimates, and in other
instances, changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period-to-period. Actual results could differ significantly
from our estimates. Our future financial statements will be affected to the extent that our actual results materially differ from these
estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,
to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

We
believe that policies associated with our revenue recognition, product warranties, inventory excess and obsolescence, allowance for credit
losses, and stock-based compensation have the greatest impact on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Therefore,
we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. 

42 

Revenue
Recognition 

We
recognize revenue when control of goods or services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect
to be entitled to in exchange for those services. 

Revenue
- Solar Energy System Installations 

The
majority of our revenue is generated from the installation of solar energy systems. We identify two performance obligations, which include
installation services and post-installation services, and we recognize revenue when control transfers to the customer, upon the completion
of the installation and upon the solar energy system passing inspection by the authority having jurisdiction, respectively. We apply
judgment in allocating the transaction price between the installation and post-installation performance obligations, based on the estimated
costs to perform our services. Changes in such estimates could have a material impact on the timing of our revenue recognition. 

Revenue
- Software Enhanced Services 

We
recognize revenue from software enhanced services, which include proposals generated from our HelioQuote TM platform and design
services performed using internally developed and external software applications. We contract with solar installers to generate proposals,
and we contract with solar sales entities to perform design services for their potential customers. Under each type of customer contract,
we generate a fixed number of proposals or designs for the customer in the month the services are contracted. Contracts with customers
are enforceable on a month-to-month basis and we recognize revenue each month based on the volume of services performed. 

Product
Warranties 

We
typically provide a 10-year warranty on our solar energy system installations, which provides assurance over the workmanship in performing
the installation, including roof leaks caused by our performance. For solar panel sales recognized prior to the Disposal Transaction,
we provide a 30-year warranty that the products will be free from defects in material and workmanship. We record a liability for estimated
future warranty claims based on historical trends and new installations. To the extent that warranty claim behavior differs from historical
trends, we may experience a material change in our warranty liability. 

Inventory
Excess and Obsolescence 

Our
inventory consists of completed solar energy systems and related components, which we classify as finished costs. We record a reserve
for inventory which is considered obsolete or in excess of anticipated demand based on a consideration of marketability and product life
cycle stage, component cost trends, demand forecasts, historical revenues, and assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
We apply judgment in estimating the excess and obsolete inventory, and changes in demand for our inventory components could have a material
impact on our inventory reserve balance. 

Allowance
for Credit Losses 

We
maintain an allowance for credit losses for estimated losses inherent in our accounts receivable portfolio. We apply judgment in estimating
the required allowance by considering historical losses adjusted to take into account current market conditions and our customers 
financial condition, the amount of receivables in dispute, the current receivables aging and our customers payment patterns. 

Stock-Based
Compensation 

We
recognize stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period on a straight-line basis for all stock-based payments that
are expected to vest to employees, non-employees and directors, including grants of employee stock options and other stock-based awards.
Equity-classified awards issued to employees and non-employees, such as consultants and non-employee directors, are measured at the grant-date
fair value of the award. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur. 

43 

For
accounting purposes, prior to the Business Combination, the fair value of the shares of common stock underlying stock options had historically
been determined by our board of directors. Because there had been no public market for our common stock, the board of directors exercised
reasonable judgment and considered a number of objective and subjective factors to determine the best estimate of the fair value of our
common stock, including important developments in our operations, sales of redeemable convertible preferred stock, actual operating results
and financial performance, the conditions in the renewable solar energy industry and the economy in general, the stock price performance
and volatility of comparable public companies, and the lack of liquidity of our common stock, among other factors. Following the Business
Combination, the fair value of common stock is based on the closing stock price on the date of grant as reported on the Nasdaq Global
Select Market. 

We
estimate the grant-date fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model
requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the fair value of the underlying common stock prior to the Mergers, the
expected term of the option, the expected volatility of the price of our common stock and expected dividend yield. We determine these
inputs as follows: 

Expected
Term - Expected term represents the period that our stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding and is determined using the simplified
method. 

Expected
Volatility - Expected volatility is estimated by studying the volatility of comparable public companies for similar terms. 

Expected Dividend - The
 Black-Scholes valuation model calls for a single expected dividend yield as an input. We have never paid dividends and have no plans
 to pay dividends. 

Risk-Free Interest Rate
 - We derive the risk-free interest rate assumption from the U.S. Treasury s rates for the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds with
 maturities similar to those of the expected term of the awards being valued. 

If
any assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model change significantly, stock-based compensation for future awards may differ
materially compared to the awards granted previously. For the thirteen-week periods ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, stock-based
compensation expense was 1.5 million and 2.1 million, respectively, of which zero and 0.5 million, respectively, related to discontinued
operations. For the thirty-nine-week periods ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, stock-based compensation expense was 4.1
million and 4.2 million, respectively, of which zero and 1.8 million, respectively, related to discontinued operations. As of September
29, 2024, we had approximately 19.6 million of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to stock options.

Revenues from solar energy
system installations for the thirteen weeks ended September 29, 2024 were 5.5 million compared to 23.9 million for the thirteen weeks
ended October 1, 2023. The decrease in solar energy system installation revenues of 18.4 million was primarily due to a decrease in the
volume of solar energy system installations. 

Revenues from software enhanced
services for the thirteen weeks ended September 29, 2024 were zero compared to 0.7 million for the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2023.
The decrease was the result of a shift in focus towards solar energy installations. 

Cost
of Revenues 

Cost
of revenues for the thirteen weeks ended September 29, 2024 was 8.7 million compared to 18.4 million for the thirteen weeks ended October
1, 2023. The decrease in cost of revenues of 9.7 million, or 53 , was primarily due to the decrease in revenue of 77 and emphasis on
managing costs. 

Gross
Margin 

Gross
margin for the thirteen weeks ended September 29, 2024 was negative 57 compared to 25 for the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2023.
The decline in the gross margin was principally attributable to the decrease in revenues, certain fixed costs included within cost of
revenues, and write-offs of inventory. 

Sales
Commissions 

Sales commissions for the
thirteen weeks ended September 29, 2024 were 7.3 million compared to 8.8 million for the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2023. The decrease
of 1.5 million, or 17 , was primarily due to the decrease in revenues. 

Sales
and Marketing 

Sales
and marketing expense for the thirteen weeks ended September 29, 2024 was 1.1 million compared to 2.2 million for the thirteen weeks
ended October 1, 2023. The decrease is attributable to a reduction in workforce. 

General
and Administrative 

General and administrative costs for the thirteen weeks ended September
29, 2024 was 18.5 million compared to 6.3 million for the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2023. The increase was primarily attributed
to the impairment of our proprietary HelioTrack TM software system, an increase in accounts receivable reserve, and recognition
of the Ayna warrants expense during the period. 

Interest Expense 

Interest expense was 2.3 million for the thirteen weeks ended September
29, 2024 compared to 1.9 million for the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2023. The increase of 0.4 million was due to an increase in
interest expense arising from our convertible notes of 2.2 million, partially offset with the decrease of 1.8 million in interest expense
due to the termination of the CS Solis debt, SCI Revolving Loan, and 2018 Bridge Loan. 

46 

Other Expense, Net 

Other expense, net for the thirteen weeks ended September 29, 2024,
decreased by 27.7 million compared to the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2023. Other expense, net in the thirteen weeks ended September
29, 2024 was expense of 65.7 million and was comprised of 62.6 million related to the recognition of a derivative liability and subsequent
change in fair value, 6.0 million of expense arising from changes in the fair value of warrants issued for our common stock, 3.8 million
of other financing costs, 0.9 million expense arising from the change in the fair value of a SAFE Agreement and 0.1 million of other
expenses, partially offset by 7.7 million of income related to changes in the fair value of our forward purchase agreements. 

Other
expense, net for the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2023 was expense of 38.0 million and was principally comprised of 35.5 million
of expense related to the issuance of common stock in connection with our forward purchase agreements, the loss on extinguishment of debt
in CS Solis of 10.3 million, 6.7 million of expense related to changes in the fair value of our forward purchase agreements, and 2.4
million expense related to the issuance of bonus shares in connection with the Mergers, partially offset by 16.9 million of income related
to changes in the fair value of warrant liabilities. 

Gain
on Extinguishment of Debt 

The
gain on extinguishment of debt arose from the exchange of certain of our debt obligations. 

Net
Loss from Continuing Operations 

As
a result of the factors discussed above, our net loss from continuing operations for the thirteen-weeks ended September 29, 2024 was 78.0
million, an increase in loss by 27.0 million, as compared to a net loss from continuing operations of 51.0 million for the thirteen-weeks
ended October 1, 2023. 

Loss
from Discontinued Operations 

We
recognized a loss of zero and 155.9 million in the thirteen weeks ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, respectively, relating
to the divestiture of our solar panel business. 

Thirty-nine
weeks ended September 29, 2024 compared to the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2023 

The
following table sets forth our unaudited statements of operations data for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 and the thirty-nine

49 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Since our inception, we have
incurred losses and negative cash flows from operations. We incurred a net loss from continuing operations of 78.0 million and 101.4
million during the thirteen weeks and thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024, respectively, and had an accumulated deficit of 458.4
million as of September 29, 2024. We had cash and cash equivalents of 79.5 million, excluding restricted cash of 3.8 million, as of
September 29, 2024. Subsequent to September 29, 2024, we used 45.0 million to complete the acquisition of certain assets of SunPower
as described in Note 20 Subsequent Events in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Although we cannot be
certain, we believe this acquisition will have a favorable effect on our operations and cash flows but initially, we expect losses and
negative cash flows will continue to be incurred while we assimilate the acquisition and right-size our operations. We believe our operating
losses and negative operating cash flows will continue into the foreseeable future. We have financed our operations primarily through
sales of equity securities, issuances of convertible notes and other convertible securities and cash generated from operations. Our cash
equivalents are on deposit with major financial institutions. Our cash position raises substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue
as a going concern for 12 months following the issuance of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

We will receive the proceeds
from any cash exercise of warrants for shares of our common stock. The aggregate amount of proceeds could be up to 257.3 million if all
the warrants are exercised for cash. However, to the extent the warrants are exercised on a cashless basis, the amount of
cash we would receive from the exercise of those warrants will decrease. The Private Warrants and Working Capital Warrants, as so identified
in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis. The Public
Warrants and the Mergers Warrants may only be exercised for cash provided there is then an effective registration statement registering
the shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of such warrants. If there is not a then-effective registration statement, then
such warrants may be exercised on a cashless basis, pursuant to an available exemption from registration under the Securities
Act. We expect to use any such proceeds for general corporate and working capital purposes, which would increase our liquidity. As of
November 15, 2024, the price of our common stock was 1.96 per share. The weighted average exercise price of the warrants was 8.12 as
of September 29, 2024. We believe the likelihood that warrant holders will exercise their warrants, and therefore the amount of cash proceeds
that we would receive, is dependent upon the market price of our common stock. If the market price for our common stock remains less than
the exercise price, we believe warrant holders will be unlikely to exercise. 

Debt Financings 

In the thirteen weeks ended
September 29, 2024, we entered into an exchange agreement which resulted in the cancellation of our existing debt in exchange for new
debt obligations and issued senior notes for cash as described below. 

July 2024 Notes 

In July 2024, we issued
 46.0 million of senior unsecured convertible notes to various lenders, 18.0 million of which were issued to a related party, and
another 18.0 million of which were issued in exchange for the cancellation of all indebtedness with Kline Hill and Carlyle (the
 July 2024 Notes ). The July 2024 Notes bear interest at 12 per annum and mature on July 1, 2029. The interest rate
increases by 3 in the case of an event of default. The July 2024 Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at the
option of the holder at a conversion rate of 1.68 per share. The July 2024 Notes will become immediately due and payable at the
option of the holder in the event of default and upon a qualifying change of control event. The conversion option is required to be
bifurcated as a derivative liability, and we recorded a derivative liability of 28.7 million on the issuance date with a
corresponding debt discount. We additionally issued a warrant to purchase shares of common stock to our broker, as described in Note
12 Warrants, the Cantor Warrant, with a fair value of 1.4 million. As of September 29, 2024, the carrying amount of the
July 2024 Notes was 107.8 million, which reflects a derivative liability of 65.9 million and convertible notes of 70.6 million,
less an unamortized debt discount of 28.7 million. 

Interest expense recognized
on the July 2024 Notes was 0.8 million in the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 of which 0.5 million was
interest expense attributable to a related party. 

50 

7 Convertible Senior Notes 

In September 2024, we issued
 66.8 million of senior unsecured convertible notes to various lenders, 8.0 million of which were issued to a related party (the September
2024 Notes ). The September 2024 Notes bear interest at 7 per annum and mature on July 1, 2029. The September 2024 Notes are convertible
into shares of our common stock at the option of the holder at a conversion rate of 2.14 per share. The September 2024 Notes will become
immediately due and payable at the option of the holder in the event of default and upon a qualifying change of control event. The conversion
option is required to be bifurcated as a derivative liability, and we recorded a derivative liability of 91.5 million on the issuance
date. As the fair value of the derivative liability exceeds the proceeds received, we recorded a corresponding financing loss of 24.7
million and debt discount for 66.8 million. As of September 29, 2024, the carrying amount of the September 2024 Notes was 89.2 million,
which reflects a derivative liability of 92.1 million and convertible notes of 66.8 million, less an unamortized debt discount of 69.7
million. 

Interest expense recognized
on the 7.0 Notes was 0.05 million in the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024. 

Forward
Purchase Agreements 

In
July 2023, FACT and Legacy Complete Solaria, Inc. entered into FPAs with each of (i) Meteora (ii) Polar, and (iii) Sandia (each
individually, a Seller , and together, the FPA Sellers ). 

Pursuant
to the terms of the FPAs, the FPA Sellers may purchase through a broker in the open market, from holders of Shares other than the Company
or affiliates thereof, FACT s ordinary shares, par value of 0.0001 per share, (the Shares ). While the FPA Sellers
have no obligation to purchase any Shares under the FPAs, the aggregate total Shares that may be purchased under the FPAs shall be no
more than 6,720,000 in aggregate. The FPA Sellers may not beneficially own greater than 9.9 of issued and outstanding Shares following
the Mergers as per the Amended and Restated Business Combination Agreement. 

The
key terms of the forward contracts are as follows: 

The FPA Sellers can terminate
 the transaction following the Optional Early Termination OET Date which shall specify the quantity by which the number
 of shares is to be reduced (such quantity, the Terminated Shares ). Seller shall terminate the transaction in respect
 of any shares sold on or prior to the maturity date. The counterparty is entitled to an amount from the seller equal to the number
 of terminated shares multiplied by a reset price. The reset price is initially 10.56 (the Initial Price and is subject
 to a 5.00 floor. 

The FPA contains multiple
 settlement outcomes. Per the terms of the agreements, the FPAs will (1) settle in cash in the event the Company is due cash upon
 settlement from the FPA Sellers or (2) settle in either cash or shares, at the discretion of the Company, should the settlement amount
 adjustment exceed the settlement amount. Should the Company elect to settle via shares, the equity will be issued in Complete Solaria
 Common Stock, with a per share price based on the volume-weighted average price VWAP over 15 scheduled trading days.
 The magnitude of the settlement is based on the Settlement Amount, an amount equal to the product of: (1) Number of shares issued
 to the FPA Seller pursuant to the FPA, less the number of Terminated Shares multiplied by (2) the VWAP over the valuation period.
 The Settlement amount will be reduced by the Settlement Adjustment, an amount equal to the product of (1) Number of shares in the
 Pricing Date Notice, less the number of Terminated Shares multiplied by 2.00. 

The Settlement occurs as
 of the Valuation Date, which is the earlier to occur of (a) the date that is two years after the date of the Closing Date of the
 Mergers (b) the date specified by Seller in a written notice to be delivered to Counterparty at Seller s discretion (which
 Valuation Date shall not be earlier than the day such notice is effective) after the occurrence of certain triggering events; and
 (c) 90 days after delivery by the Counterparty of a written notice in the event that for any 20 trading days during a 30 consecutive
 trading day-period (the Measurement Period that occurs at least 6 months after the Closing Date, the VWAP is less
 than the then applicable Reset Price. 

We
entered into four separate FPAs, three of which, associated with the obligation to issue 6,300,000 Shares, were entered into prior to
the closing of the Mergers. Upon signing the FPAs, we incurred an obligation to issue a fixed number of shares to the FPA Sellers contingent
upon the closing of the Mergers in addition to the terms and conditions associated with the settlement of the FPAs. We accounted for
the contingent obligation to issue shares in accordance with ASC 815 and recorded a liability and Other expense, net based on the fair
value upon of the obligation upon the signing of the FPAs. The liability was extinguished in July 2023 upon the issuance of Complete
Solaria Common Stock to the FPA sellers. 

51 

Additionally,
in accordance with ASC 480, we determined that the forward contracts are financial instruments other than shares that represent or are
indexed to obligations to repurchase the issuer s equity shares by transferring assets, referred to herein as the forward
purchase liability on our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. We initially measured the forward purchase liabilities
at fair value and have subsequently remeasured them at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. 

Through
the date of issuance of the Complete Solaria Common Stock in satisfaction of our obligation to issue shares around the closing of the
Mergers, we recorded 35.5 million to Other expense, net associated with the issuance of 6,720,000 shares of Complete Solaria Common Stock. 

As
of the closing of the Mergers and issuance of the Complete Solaria Common Stock underlying the FPAs, the fair value of the prepaid FPAs
was an asset balance of 0.1 million and was recorded on our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets and within Other expense,
net on our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Subsequently, the change in the fair value
of the forward purchase liabilities amounted to income of 7.7 million for the thirteen weeks ended September 29, 2024, and expense of
 4.9 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024. As of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the forward purchase
agreements balance was an asset of 1.1 million and a liability of 3.8 million, respectively. Of the balances as of September 29, 2024
and December 31, 2023, 0.9 million asset balance and 3.2 million liability balance, respectively, are with related parties. Refer to
Note 19 Related Party Transactions in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further details. 

On
December 18, 2023, we and the FPA Sellers entered into separate amendments to the FPAs (the Amendments ). The Amendments
lower the reset floor price of each FPA from 5.00 to 3.00 and allow us to raise up to 10.0 million of equity from existing stockholders
without triggering certain anti-dilution provisions contained in the FPAs; provided, the insiders pay a price per share for their initial
investment equal to the closing price per share as quoted on the Nasdaq on the day of purchase; provided, further, that any subsequent
investments are made at a price per share equal to the greater of (a) the closing price per share as quoted by Nasdaq on the day of the
purchase or (b) the amount paid in connection with the initial investment. 

On
May 7 and 8, 2024, respectively, we entered into separate amendments to the FPAs (collectively the Second Amendments with
Sandia (the Sandia Second Amendment and Polar (the Polar Second Amendment ). The Second Amendments lowered
the reset price of each FPA from 3.00 to 1.00 per share and amended the VWAP Trigger Event provision to read as After December
31, 2024, an event that occurs if the VWAP Price, for any 20 trading days during a 30 consecutive trading day-period, is below 1.00
per Share . The Sandia Second Amendment is not effective until we execute similar amendments with both Polar and Meteora. 

On June 14, 2024, we entered
into an amendment to the FPA with Sandia (the Sandia Third Amendment ). The Sandia Third Amendment set the reset price of
each FPA to 1.00 per share and amended the VWAP Trigger Event provision to read as After December 31, 2024, an event that occurs
if the VWAP Price, for any 20 trading days during a 30 consecutive trading day-period, is below 1.00 per Share. 

SAFE
Agreements 

On
January 31, 2024, we entered into a simple agreement for future equity (the First SAFE with the Rodgers Massey Freedom
and Free Markets Charitable Trust (the Purchaser in connection with the Purchaser investing 1.5 million in the Company.
The First SAFE was initially convertible into shares of our common stock, par value 0.0001 per share, upon the initial closing of a
bona fide transaction or series of transactions with the principal purpose of raising capital, pursuant to which we would have issued
and sold our common stock at a fixed valuation (an Equity Financing ), at a per share conversion price which was equal to
the lower of (i) (a) 53.54 million divided by (b) our capitalization immediately prior to such Equity Financing (such conversion price,
the SAFE Price ), and (ii) 80 of the price per share of our common stock sold in the Equity Financing. If we consummated
a change of control prior to the termination of the First SAFE, the Purchaser would have been automatically entitled to receive a portion
of the proceeds of such liquidity event equal to the greater of (i) 1.5 million and (ii) the amount payable on the number of shares
of our common stock equal to (a) 1.5 million divided by (b)(1) 53.54 million divided by (2) our capitalization immediately prior to
such liquidity event (the Liquidity Price ), subject to certain adjustments as set forth in the First SAFE. The First SAFE
was convertible into a maximum of 1,431,297 shares of our common stock, assuming a per share conversion price of 1.05, which is the
product of (i) 1.31, the closing price of our common stock on January 31, 2024, multiplied by (ii) 80 . 

52 

On
February 15, 2024, we entered into a simple agreement for future equity (the Second SAFE with the Purchaser in connection
with the Purchaser investing 3.5 million in the Company. The Second SAFE was initially convertible into shares of our common stock upon
the initial closing of an Equity Financing at a per share conversion price which was equal to the lower of (i) the Second SAFE Price,
and (ii) 80 of the price per share of our common stock sold in the Equity Financing. If we consummated a change of control prior to
the termination of the Second SAFE, the Purchaser would have been automatically entitled to receive an amount equal to the greater of
(i) 3.5 million and (ii) the amount payable on the number of shares of our common stock equal to 3.5 million divided by the Liquidity
Price, subject to certain adjustments as set forth in the Second SAFE. The Second SAFE was convertible into a maximum of 3,707,627 shares
of our common stock, assuming a per share conversion price of 0.94, which is the product of (i) 1.18, the closing price of our common
stock on February 15, 2024, multiplied by (ii) 80 . 

On
April 21, 2024, we entered into an amendment for each of our First SAFE and Second SAFE to convert the invested amounts into shares of
our common stock. The conversion share price was 0.36, calculated as the product of (i) 0.45, the closing price of our common stock
on April 19, 2024, multiplied by (ii) 80 . The First SAFE and Second SAFE converted into 4,166,667 and 9,722,222 shares of our common
stock, respectively. 

On
May 13, 2024, we entered into a simple agreement for future equity (the Third SAFE and together with the First SAFE and
Second SAFE, the SAFEs with the Purchaser in connection with the Purchaser investing 1.0 million in the Company. The Third
SAFE is convertible into shares of our common stock upon the initial closing of an Equity Financing at a per share conversion price which
is equal to 50 of the price per share of our common stock sold in the Equity Financing. If we consummate a change of control prior
to the termination of the Third SAFE, the Purchaser will be automatically entitled to receive a portion of the proceeds of such liquidity
event equal to 1.0 million, subject to certain adjustments as set forth in the Third SAFE. The Third SAFE is convertible into a maximum
of 2,750,000 shares of our common stock, assuming a per share conversion price of 0.275, which is the product of (i) 0.55, the closing
price of our common stock on May 13, 2024, multiplied by (ii) 50 . 

Common Stock Purchase
Agreement 

On
July 16, 2024, we entered into a common stock purchase agreement with White Lion Capital, LLC White Lion ), as amended on
July 24, 2024 White Lion SPA ), and a related registration rights agreement for an equity line of credit financing facility.
Pursuant to the White Lion SPA, we have the right, but not the obligation, to require White Lion to purchase, from time to time up to
 30 million in aggregate gross purchase price of newly issued shares of our common stock, subject to the caps and certain limitations
and conditions set forth in the White Lion SPA, including terms that restrict our ability to issue shares of common stock to White Lion
that would result in White Lion beneficially owning more than 9.99 of our outstanding common stock. 

On
August 14, 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to the White Lion SPA (collectively with the White Lion SPA White Lion Amended
SPA ). The White Lion Amended SPA provides that we may notify White Lion to exercise our right to sell shares of our common stock
by delivering an Hour Rapid Purchase Notice (as defined in the White Lion Amended SPA). If we deliver an Hour Rapid Purchase Notice, we
shall deliver to White Lion shares of our common stock not to exceed the lesser of (i) five percent of the Average Daily Trading Volume
(as defined in the White Lion SPA) on the date of an Hour Rapid Purchase Notice and (ii) 100,000 shares of common stock. The closing of
the transactions under an Hour Rapid Purchase Notice will occur one Business Day (as defined in White Lion Amended SPA following the date
on which the Hour Rapid Purchase Notice is delivered. At such closing, White Lion will pay us the Hour Rapid Purchase Investment Amount
(as defined in White Lion Amended SPA) equal to the number of shares of common stock subject to the applicable Hour Rapid Purchase Notice
multiplied by the lowest traded price of our common stock during the one-hour period following White Lion s consent to the acceptance
of the applicable Hour Rapid Purchase Notice. Under the White Lion Amended SPA, we issued a total of 2.8 million shares of common stock
for net proceeds of 6.1 million during the period ended September 29, 2024.

Cash
Flows from Operating Activities 

Net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations of
 29.1 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 was primarily due to the net loss from continuing operations, net of
tax of 101.4 million, partially offset by non-cash adjustments of 70.8 million and net cash inflows of 1.5 million from changes in
our operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash adjustments in our operating results consisted of 62.6 million arising from the issuance
and subsequent change in fair value of derivative liabilities in connection with our convertible notes issued and outstanding, 5.4 million
of expense in connection with warrants issued for vendor services, 3.1 million of expense related to changes in provision for credit
losses, 4.1 million of stock-based compensation expense, 3.7 million of loss on impairment of assets, 3.9 million of expense in accretion
of interest attributable to the CS Solis debt, 3.8 million of other noncash financing costs, 1.9 million of non-cash interest expense,
 1.3 million of loss arising from the conversion of two SAFE Agreements to shares of our common stock, 1.0 million of depreciation and
amortization, 0.9 million of expense related to changes in the fair value of the SAFE Agreements, 2.1 million of loss from the changes
in the fair value of our warrant liabilities, 1.4 million of debt issuance costs, 0.5 million of lease expense and 0.1 million provision
for excess and obsolete inventory. These adjustments were partially offset by a 19.9 million gain on extinguishment of debt, 4.9 million
of income related to changes in fair value of our forward purchase agreements. The main drivers of net cash inflows derived from the changes
in operating assets and liabilities were related to a decrease in accounts receivable, net of 14.7 million and a decrease in inventories
of 2.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable of 8.5 million, an increase in prepaid and other current assets of
 3.2 million, a decrease in deferred revenue of 1.4 million, a decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities of 1.6 million, and
a decrease in operating lease liabilities of 0.9 million. 

Net
cash used in operating activities from continuing operations of 47.2 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2023 was primarily
due to the net loss from continuing operations, net of tax of 73.4 million and net cash outflows of 18.8 million from changes in our
operating assets and liabilities, adjusted for non-cash charges of 45.1 million. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of 35.5 million
for the issuance of common stock in connection with our forward purchase agreements, 10.3 million loss on CS Solis debt extinguishment,
 6.7 million of expense related to changes in fair value of our forward purchase agreements, 4.3 million of expense due to changes in
allowance for credit losses, 4.0 million of interest expense, 2.5 million of expense due to accretion of long-term debt in CS Solis,
 2.4 million related to the issuance of bonus common stock shares in connection with the Mergers, 2.3 million of stock-based compensation
expense, and 2.1 million relating to the change in reserve for excess and obsolete inventory, partially offset by a decrease in the
fair value of warrant liabilities of 26.3 million. The main drivers of net cash outflows derived from the changes in operating assets
and liabilities were related to an increase in accounts receivable, net of 11.8 million, an increase in prepaid expenses and other current
assets of 8.3 million, an increase in inventory of 3.9 million, and a decrease in deferred revenue of 1.8 million, partially offset
by an increase in accounts payable of 4.4 million, an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of 1.6 million and
a decrease in other noncurrent assets of 1.1 million. 

The
net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash from discontinued operations of 0.2 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended
October 1, 2023 was entirely attributable to net cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations. This increase was
primarily due to the net loss from discontinued operations, net of tax of 168.5 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of 152.9 million
and net cash inflows of 15.8 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of impairment
of goodwill of 119.4 million, impairment of intangible assets of 28.1 million, depreciation and amortization expense of 2.4 million,
stock-based compensation expense of 1.8 million and a 1.1 million change in allowance for credit losses. The main drivers of net cash
inflows derived from the changes in operating assets and liabilities were related to a decrease in accounts receivable, net of 8.2 million,
an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of 6.0 million, a decrease in long-term deposits of 2.8 million, and
a decrease in inventories of 2.3 million, partially offset by a decrease of 2.9 million in accounts payable. 

Cash
Flows from Investing Activities 

Net
cash used in investing activities was 1.0 million and 1.5 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024, and October 1,
2023, respectively, and attributable to additions to internal-use-software. 

Cash
Flows from Financing Activities 

Net cash provided by financing
activities of 107.1 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 was primarily due to 94.7 million in net proceeds from
the issuance of convertible notes, inclusive of 26.0 million from a related party, 6.1 million in net proceeds from the issuance of
shares of our common stock from White Lion and 6.0 million in net proceeds from the issuance of SAFE Agreements, and 0.6 million of
proceeds from the exercise of common stock options, partially offset by 0.3 million repayment of notes payable. 

Net
cash provided by financing activities of 45.6 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2023 was primarily due to 21.3 million
in net proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes, 19.8 million in proceeds from the Mergers and PIPE Financing and 14.1 million
in net proceeds from the issuance of notes payable, partially offset by repayment of notes payable of 9.7 million. 

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As
of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, Complete Solaria does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are
reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses,
results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that are material to investors. The term off-balance
sheet arrangement generally means any transaction, agreement, or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated
with Complete Solaria is a party, under which it has any obligation arising under a guaranteed contract, derivative instrument, or variable
interest or a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity,
or market risk support for such assets. 

Currently,
Complete Solaria does not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. 

54 

Emerging
Growth Company Status 

Section
102(b)(1) of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, exempts emerging growth companies from being required
to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies are required to comply with the new or revised financial
accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can choose not to take advantage of the extended transition period and comply
with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies, and any such election to not take advantage of the extended transition
period is irrevocable. 

Complete
Solaria is an emerging growth company as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act and has elected to take advantage
of the benefits of the extended transition period for new or revised financial accounting standards. Following the closing of the Mergers,
our Post-Combination Company will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which
the market value of common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the end of that year s second fiscal
quarter, (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we has total annual gross revenue of 1.235 billion or more during such fiscal
year (as indexed for inflation), (iii) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt in the prior three-year
period, or (iv) December 31, 2025. Complete Solaria expects to continue to take advantage of the benefits of the extended transition
period, although it may decide to early adopt such new or revised accounting standards to the extent permitted by such standards. This
may make it difficult or impossible to compare our financial results with the financial results of another public company that is either
not an emerging growth company or is an emerging growth company that has chosen not to take advantage of the extended transition period
exemptions because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. 

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We
are exposed to certain market risks in the ordinary course of our business. The Company monitors and manages these financial exposures
as an integral part of its overall risk management program. 

Interest
Rate Risk 

We
do not have significant exposure to interest rate risk that could affect the balance sheet, statement of operations, and the statement
of cash flows, as we do not have any outstanding variable rate debt as of September 29, 2024. 

Concentrations
of Credit Risk and Major Customers 

Our
customer base consists primarily of residential homeowners. We do not require collateral on our accounts receivable. Further, our accounts
receivable amounts are with individual homeowners who finance their purchase through a few third-party financing entities through whom
we collect the receivable, and we are exposed to normal industry credit risks. We continually evaluate our reserves for potential credit
losses and establish reserves for such losses. 

As
of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, three financing entities accounted for 10 or more of the total accounts receivable, net
balance. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures (Disclosure Controls) within the meaning of Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the Exchange Act ). Our Disclosure Controls are designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act, such as this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms.
Our Disclosure Controls are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In
designing and evaluating our Disclosure Controls, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily applied its
judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures. 

As
of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of
our Disclosure Controls, which was done under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. Based on the evaluation of our Disclosure Controls, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer have concluded that, as of September 29, 2024, our Disclosure Controls were not effective due to a material weakness in our internal
control over financial reporting as disclosed below. 

55 

Material
Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Prior
to the Business Combination, we were a special purpose acquisition company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock
exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more operating businesses.
As a result, previously existing internal controls are no longer applicable or comprehensive enough as of the assessment date as our
operations prior to the Business Combination were insignificant compared to those of the consolidated entity post-Business Combination.
In addition, the design of internal controls over financial reporting for the Company following the Business Combination has required
and will continue to require significant time and resources from our management and other personnel. 

In
connection with the preparation and audit of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, our management identified
material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies,
in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or
interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses are as follows: 

We
do not have sufficient full-time accounting personnel, (i) to enable appropriate reviews over the financial close and reporting process,
(ii) to allow for an appropriate segregation of duties, and (iii) with the requisite experience and technical accounting knowledge to
identify, review and resolve complex accounting issues under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP ).
Additionally, we did not adequately design and/or implement controls related to conducting a formal risk assessment process. 

Inventory
controls related to the completeness, existence, and cut-off of inventories held at third parties, and controls related to the calculation
of adjustments to inventory for items considered excessive and obsolete. 

We
were not required to perform an evaluation of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 in accordance with Section
215.02 of the SEC s Division of Corporation Finance s Regulation S-K Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations. Had such
an evaluation been performed, additional control deficiencies may have been identified by our management, and those control deficiencies
could have also represented one or more material weaknesses. 

Plan
to Remediate Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

We
have taken certain steps, such as recruiting additional personnel, in addition to utilizing third-party consultants and specialists,
to supplement our internal resources, to enhance our internal control environment and plans to take additional steps to remediate the
material weaknesses. Although we plan to complete this remediation process as quickly as possible, we cannot at this time estimate how
long it will take. We cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date and may take in the future, will be sufficient to remediate
the control deficiencies that led to our material weakness in internal control over financial reporting or that it will prevent or avoid
potential future material weaknesses. 

If
we are not able to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and Disclosure Controls, or if material weaknesses are
discovered in future periods, a risk that is significantly increased in light of the complexity of our business, we may be unable to
accurately and timely report our financial position, results of operations, cash flows or key operating metrics, which could result in
late filings of the annual and quarterly reports under the Exchange Act, restatements of financial statements or other corrective disclosures,
an inability to access commercial lending markets, defaults under our secured revolving credit facility and other agreements, or other
material adverse effects on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Other
than the material weakness and remediation efforts described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
that occurred during the quarter to which this report relates, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

The information with respect
to legal proceedings is set forth under Note 17 - Commitments and Contingencies, in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and is incorporated herein by reference. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

Investing
in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together
with all of the other information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including our unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements and related notes appearing in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in the section titled Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, before deciding to invest in our securities. If any
of the events or developments described below were to occur, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition could
suffer materially, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks
and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that
we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. The risks facing our business have not changed substantively
from those discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, except for those risks marked with an asterisk ). 

Risks
Related to our Businesses and Industry 

Our
business depends in part on the availability of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives. The expiration, elimination or reduction
of these rebates, credits or incentives or the ability to monetize them could adversely impact our business. 

U.S.
federal, state and local government bodies provide incentives to end users, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of solar
energy systems to promote solar electricity in the form of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives such as system performance
payments, payments for renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation and the exclusion of solar energy systems
from property tax assessments. These incentives enable us to lower the price charged to customers for energy and for solar energy systems.
However, these incentives may expire on a particular date, end when the allocated funding is exhausted or be reduced or terminated as
solar energy adoption rates increase. These reductions or terminations often occur without warning. 

The
Inflation Reduction Act IRA extended and modified prior law applicable to tax credits that are available with respect
to solar energy systems. Under the IRA, the following credits are available: (i) a production tax credit under Code Section 44 (for facilities
that begin construction before January 1, 2025) and Code Section 45Y (for facilities that begin construction between January 1, 2025
and the year that is four calendar years after the year in which certain U.S. greenhouse gas emissions percentages are met) (the PTC in connection with the installation of certain solar facilities and energy storage technology, (ii) an investment tax credit under Code
Section 48 (for facilities that begin construction before January 1, 2025) and Code Section 48E (for facilities that begin construction
between January 1, 2025 and the year that is four calendar years after the year in which certain U.S. greenhouse gas emissions percentages
are met) (the ITC in connection with the installation of certain solar facilities and energy storage technology, and (iii)
a residential clean energy credit (the Section 25D Credit in connection with the installation of property that uses solar
energy to generate electricity for residential use. 

Prior
to the IRA, the PTC for solar facilities had phased out and was no longer available. The IRA reinstated the PTC for solar facilities.
The PTC available to a taxpayer in a taxable year is equal to a certain rate multiplied by the kilowatt hours of electricity produced
by the taxpayer from solar energy at a facility owned by it and sold to an unrelated party during that taxable year. The base rate for
the PTC is 0.3 cents. This rate is increased to 1.5 cents for projects that (i) have a maximum net output of less than one MW AC, (ii)
begin construction before January 29, 2023, or (iii) meet certain prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements. It also may be increased
for projects that include a certain percentage of components that were produced in the U.S., projects that are located in certain energy
communities, and projects that are located in low-income communities. 

57 

The
ITC available to a taxpayer in a taxable year is equal to the energy percentage of the basis of energy property 
placed in service by the taxpayer during that taxable year. Energy property includes equipment that uses solar energy to
generate electricity (including structural components that are necessary to the functioning of a solar facility as a whole) and certain
energy storage systems (including batteries included as part of or adjacent to a solar facility). The base energy percentage 
for the ITC is 6 . This energy percentage is increased to 30 for projects that (i) have a maximum net output of less than one MW AC,
(ii) begin construction before January 29, 2023, or (iii) meet certain prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements. It also may be
increased for projects that include a certain percentage of components that were produced in the U.S., projects that are located in certain
energy communities, and projects that are located in low-income communities. ITCs are subject to recapture if, during the five-year period
after a facility is placed in service, the facility is sold, exchanged, involuntarily converted, or ceases its business usage. If the
event that causes such recapture occurs within the first year after a project is placed in service, 100 of the ITCs will be recaptured.
The recapture percentage is reduced 20 for each subsequent year. Historically, we have utilized the ITC when available for both residential
and commercial leases and power purchase agreements, based on ownership of the solar energy system. 

The
Section 25D Credit available to a taxpayer is equal to the applicable percentage of expenditures for property that uses
solar energy to generate electricity for use in a dwelling unit used as a residence by the taxpayer. The applicable percentage is 26 
for such systems that are placed in service before January 1, 2022, 30 for such systems that are placed in service after December 31,
2021 and before January 1, 2033, 26 for such systems that are placed in service in 2033, and 22 for such systems that are placed in
service in 2034. The Section 25D Credit is scheduled to expire effective January 1, 2035. Although it is unlikely that Complete Solaria
would qualify for the Section 25D Credit, the availability of the Section 25D Credit may impact the prices of its solar energy systems. 

Reductions
in, eliminations of, or expirations of, governmental incentives could adversely impact results of operations and ability to compete in
this industry by increasing the cost of capital, causing us to increase the prices of our energy and solar energy systems and reduce
the size of our addressable market. 

We
are an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting
requirements applicable to these companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors. 

We
are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (JOBS Act). For as long as
we continue to be an emerging growth company, we intend to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that apply
to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including: 

being permitted to provide
 only two years of audited financial statements, in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements, with correspondingly
 reduced Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations disclosure in our
 periodic reports; 

not being required to comply
 with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the Sarbanes-Oxley
 Act 

not being required to comply
 with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the PCAOB regarding mandatory
 audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial
 statements; 

reduced disclosure obligations
 regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; and 

exemptions from the requirements
 of holding nonbinding advisory stockholder votes on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments
 not previously approved. 

Under
the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards
apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore,
will not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
As a result, our financial statements may be different from companies that comply with the new or revised accounting pronouncements as
of public company effective dates. 

58 

We
will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have at least
 1.235 billion in total annual gross revenues; (2) the date we qualify as a large accelerated filer, with at least 700.0
million of equity securities held by non-affiliates; (3) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt
securities during the prior three-year period; and (4) the last day of the fiscal year ending after the fifth anniversary of our IPO. 

Even
after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still qualify as a smaller reporting company, as defined
in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), which would allow us to continue to take advantage
of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements
of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation our periodic reports and
proxy statements. 

We
cannot predict if investors will find our securities less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find
our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading price of our
securities may be more volatile. 

Existing
regulations and policies and changes to these regulations and policies may present technical, regulatory, and economic barriers to the
purchase and use of solar power products, which may significantly reduce demand for our products and services. 

The
market for electric generation products is heavily influenced by federal, state and local government laws, regulations and policies concerning
the electric utility industry in the U.S. and abroad, as well as policies promulgated by electric utilities. These regulations and policies
often relate to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation, and changes that make solar
power less competitive with other power sources could deter investment in the research and development of alternative energy sources
as well as customer purchases of solar power technology, which could in turn result in a significant reduction in the demand for our
solar power products. The market for electric generation equipment is also influenced by trade and local content laws, regulations and
policies that can discourage growth and competition in the solar industry and create economic barriers to the purchase of solar power
products, thus reducing demand for our solar products. In addition, on-grid applications depend on access to the grid, which is also
regulated by government entities. We anticipate that our solar power products and our installation will continue to be subject to oversight
and regulation in accordance with federal, state, local and foreign regulations relating to construction, safety, environmental protection,
utility interconnection and metering, trade, and related matters. It is difficult to track the requirements of individual states or local
jurisdictions and design equipment to comply with the varying standards. In addition, the U.S. and European Union, among others, have
imposed tariffs or are in the process of evaluating the imposition of tariffs on solar panels, solar cells, polysilicon, and potentially
other components. These and any other tariffs or similar taxes or duties may increase the price of our solar products and adversely affect
our cost reduction roadmap, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition. Any new regulations or policies pertaining
our solar power products may result in significant additional expenses for our customers, which could cause a significant reduction in
demand for our solar power products. 

We
rely on net metering and related policies to offer competitive pricing to customers in many of our current markets and changes to net
metering policies may significantly reduce demand for electricity from residential solar energy systems. 

Net
metering is one of several key policies that have enabled the growth of distributed generation solar energy systems in the U.S., providing
significant value to customers for electricity generated by their residential solar energy systems but not directly consumed on-site.
Net metering allows a homeowner to pay his or her local electric utility for power usage net of production from the solar energy system
or other distributed generation source. Homeowners receive a credit for the energy an interconnected solar energy system generates in
excess of that needed by the home to offset energy purchases from the centralized utility made at times when the solar energy system
is not generating sufficient energy to meet the customer s demand. In many markets, this credit is equal to the residential retail
rate for electricity and in other markets, such as Hawaii and Nevada, the rate is less than the retail rate and may be set, for example,
as a percentage of the retail rate or based upon a valuation of the excess electricity. In some states and utility territories, customers
are also reimbursed by the centralized electric utility for net excess generation on a periodic basis. 

59 

Net
metering programs have been subject to legislative and regulatory scrutiny in some states and territories including, but not limited
to, California, New Jersey, Arizona, Nevada, Connecticut, Florida, Maine, Kentucky, Puerto Rico and Guam. These jurisdictions, by statute,
regulation, administrative order or a combination thereof, have recently adopted or are considering new restrictions and additional changes
to net metering programs either on a state-wide basis or within specific utility territories. Many of these measures were introduced
and supported by centralized electric utilities. These measures vary by jurisdiction and may include a reduction in the rates or value
of the credits customers are paid or receive for the power they deliver back to the electrical grid, caps or limits on the aggregate
installed capacity of generation in a state or utility territory eligible for net metering, expiration dates for and phasing out of net
metering programs, replacement of net metering programs with alternative programs that may provide less compensation and limits on the
capacity size of individual distributed generation systems that can qualify for net metering. Net metering and related policies concerning
distributed generation also received attention from federal legislators and regulators. 

In
California, the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC issued an order in 2016 retaining retail-based net
metering credits for residential customers of California s major utilities as part of Net Energy Metering 2.0 NEM 2.0 ).
Under NEM 2.0, new distributed generation customers receive the retail rate for electricity exported to the grid, less certain non-bypassable
fees. Customers under NEM 2.0 also are subject to interconnection charges and time-of-use rates. Existing customers who receive service
under the prior net metering program, as well as new customers under the NEM 2.0 program, currently are permitted to remain covered by
them on a legacy basis for a period of 20 years. On September 3, 2020, the CPUC opened a new proceeding to review its current net metering
policies and to develop Net Energy Metering 3.0 NEM 3.0 ), also referred to by the CPUC as the NEM 2.0 successor
tariff. NEM 3.0 was finalized on December 15, 2022 and will include several changes from previous net metering plans. There will be changes
that impact the amount that homeowners with solar power will be able to recuperate when selling excess energy back to the utility grid.
With NEM 3.0, the value of the credits for net exports will be tied to the state s 2022 Distributed Energy Resources Avoided Cost
Calculator Documentation ACC ). Another significant change with NEM 3.0 will be applied to the netting period: the
time period over which the utilities measure the clean energy being imported or exported. In general, longer netting periods have typically
been advantageous for solar power customers because production can offset any consumption. NEM 3.0 will instead measure energy using
instantaneous netting, which means interval netting approximately every 15 minutes. This will lead to more NEM customers electricity
registering as exports, now valued at the new, lower ACC value. 

We
utilize a limited number of suppliers of solar panels and other system components to adequately meet anticipated demand for our solar
service offerings. Any shortage, delay or component price change from these suppliers or delays and price increases associated with the
product transport logistics could result in sales and installation delays, cancellations and loss of market share. 

We
purchase solar panels, inverters and other system components from a limited number of suppliers, which makes us susceptible to quality
issues, shortages and price changes. If we fail to develop, maintain and expand relationships with existing or new suppliers, we may
be unable to adequately meet anticipated demand for our solar energy systems or may only be able to offer our systems at higher costs
or after delays. If one or more of the suppliers that we rely upon to meet anticipated demand ceases or reduces production, we may be
unable to satisfy this demand due to an inability to quickly identify alternate suppliers or to qualify alternative products on commercially
reasonable terms. 

In
particular, there are a limited number of inverter suppliers. Once we design a system for use with a particular inverter, if that type
of inverter is not readily available at an anticipated price, we may incur additional delay and expense to redesign the system. 

In
addition, production of solar panels involves the use of numerous raw materials and components. Several of these have experienced periods
of limited availability, particularly polysilicon, as well as indium, cadmium telluride, aluminum and copper. The manufacturing infrastructure
for some of these raw materials and components has a long lead time, requires significant capital investment and relies on the continued
availability of key commodity materials, potentially resulting in an inability to meet demand for these components. The prices for these
raw materials and components fluctuate depending on global market conditions and demand and we may experience rapid increases in costs
or sustained periods of limited supplies. 

60 

Despite
efforts to obtain components from multiple sources whenever possible, many suppliers may be single-source suppliers of certain components.
If we cannot maintain long-term supply agreements or identify and qualify multiple sources for components, access to supplies at satisfactory
prices, volumes and quality levels may be harmed. We may also experience delivery delays of components from suppliers in various global
locations. In addition, while there are alternative suppliers and service providers that we could enter into agreements with to replace
its suppliers on commercially reasonable terms, we may be unable to establish alternate supply relationships or obtain or engineer replacement
components in the short term, or at all, at favorable prices or costs. Qualifying alternate suppliers or developing our own replacements
for certain components may be time-consuming and costly and may force us to make modifications to our product designs. 

Our
need to purchase supplies globally and our continued international expansion further subjects us to risks relating to currency fluctuations.
Any decline in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar compared to the functional currency of component suppliers could increase component
prices. In addition, the state of the financial markets could limit suppliers ability to raise capital if they are required to
expand their production to meet our needs or satisfy our operating capital requirements. Changes in economic and business conditions,
wars, governmental changes and other factors beyond our control or which we do not presently anticipate, could also affect suppliers 
solvency and ability to deliver components on a timely basis. Any of these shortages, delays or price changes could limit our growth,
cause cancellations or adversely affect profitability and the ability to compete in the markets in which we operate effectively. 

Our
business substantially focuses on solar service agreements and transactions with residential customers. 

Our
business substantially focuses on solar service agreements and transactions with residential customers. Our energy system sales to homeowners
utilize power purchase agreements PPAs ), leases, loans and other products and services. We currently offer PPAs
and leases through, EverBright, LLC, and other financial institutions. If we were unable to arrange new or alternative financing methods
for PPAs and leases on favorable terms, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially and
adversely affected. 

Changes
in international trade policies, tariffs, or trade disputes could significantly and adversely affect our business, revenues, margins,
results of operations, and cash flows. 

On
February 7, 2018, safeguard tariffs on imported solar cells and modules went into effect pursuant to Proclamation 9693, which approved
recommendations to provide relief to U.S. manufacturers and impose safeguard tariffs on imported solar cells and modules, based on the
investigations, findings, and recommendations of the U.S. International Trade Commission (the International Trade Commission ).
Since 2021, modules are subject to a tariff rate of 15 . Cells are subjected to a tariff-rate quota, under which the first 2.5 GW of
cell imports each year will be exempt from tariffs, and cells imported after the 2.5 GW quota has been reached will be subject to the
same 30 tariff as modules in the first year, with the same 5 decline in each of the three subsequent years. The tariff-free cell quota
applies globally, without any allocation by country or region. 

61 

The
tariffs could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. While solar cells and modules based on interdigitated
back contact technology were granted exclusion from these safeguard tariffs on September 19, 2018, our solar products based on other
technologies continue to be subject to the safeguard tariffs. Although we are actively engaged in efforts to mitigate the effect of these
tariffs, there is no guarantee that these efforts will be successful. 

Uncertainty
surrounding the implications of existing tariffs affecting the U.S. solar market and potential trade tensions between the U.S. and other
countries is likely to cause market volatility, price fluctuations, supply shortages, and project delays, any of which could harm our
business, and the pursuit of mitigating actions may divert substantial resources from other projects. Further, the Uyghur Forced Labor
Prevention Act may inhibit importation of certain solar modules or components. In addition, the imposition of tariffs is likely to result
in a wide range of impacts to the U.S. solar industry and the global manufacturing market, as well as our business in particular. Such
tariffs could materially increase the price of our solar products and result in significant additional costs to the company, its resellers,
and the resellers customers, which could cause a significant reduction in demand for the company s solar power products
and greatly reduce our competitive advantage. 

If
we fail to manage operations and growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of customer
service or adequately address competitive challenges. 

We
have experienced significant growth in recent periods as measured by our number of customers; we intend to continue efforts to expand
our business within existing and new markets. This growth has placed, and any future growth may place, a strain on management, operational
and financial infrastructure. Our growth requires our management to devote a significant amount of time and effort to maintain and expand
relationships with customers, dealers and other third parties, attract new customers and dealers, arrange financing for growth and manage
expansion into additional markets. 

In
addition, our current and planned operations, personnel, information technology and other systems and procedures might need to be revised
to support future growth and may require us to make additional unanticipated investments in its infrastructure. Our success and ability
to further scale our business will depend, in part, on our ability to manage these changes in a cost-effective and efficient manner. 

If
we cannot manage operations and growth, we may be unable to meet expectations regarding growth, opportunity and financial targets, take
advantage of market opportunities, execute our business strategies or respond to competitive pressures. This could also result in declines
in quality or customer satisfaction, increased costs, difficulties in introducing new offerings or other operational difficulties. Any
failure to effectively manage our operations and growth could adversely impact our reputation, business, financial condition, cash flows
and results of operations. 

We
have international activities and customers in the European Union, and plans to continue these efforts, which subjects us to additional
business risks, including logistical and compliance related complexity. 

A
portion of our sales are made to customers outside of the U.S., and a substantial portion of our supply agreements are with supply and
equipment vendors located outside of the U.S. We have solar cell and module production lines located at our outsourced manufacturing
facilities in Thailand, Vietnam, and India. We are also considering other manufacturing locations. 

Risks
we face in conducting business internationally include: 

multiple,
conflicting and changing laws and regulations, export and import restrictions, employment laws, data protection laws, environmental protection,
regulatory requirements, international trade agreements, and other government approvals, permits and licenses; 

difficulties and costs
 in staffing and managing foreign operations as well as cultural differences; 

62 

potentially adverse tax
 consequences associated with current, future or deemed permanent establishment of operations in multiple countries; 

relatively uncertain legal
 systems, including potentially limited protection for intellectual property rights, and laws, changes in the governmental incentives
 that we rely on, regulations and policies which impose additional restrictions on the ability of foreign companies to conduct business
 in certain countries or otherwise place them at a competitive disadvantage in relation to domestic companies; 

inadequate local infrastructure
 and developing telecommunications infrastructures; 

financial risks, such as
 longer sales and payment cycles and greater difficulty collecting accounts receivable; 

currency fluctuations,
 government-fixed foreign exchange rates, the effects of currency hedging activity, and the potential inability to hedge currency
 fluctuations; 

political and economic
 instability, including wars, acts of terrorism, political unrest, boycotts, curtailments of trade and other business restrictions; 

trade barriers such as
 export requirements, tariffs, taxes and other restrictions and expenses, which could increase the prices of our products and make
 the company less competitive in some countries; and 

liabilities associated
 with compliance with laws (for example, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the U.S. and similar laws outside of the U.S.). 

We
have an organizational structure involving entities globally. This increases the potential impact of adverse changes in laws, rules and
regulations affecting the free flow of goods and personnel, and therefore heightens some of the risks noted above. Further, this structure
requires us to manage our international inventory and warehouses effectively. If we fail to do so, our shipping movements may not correspond
with product demand and flow. Unsettled intercompany balances between entities could result, if changes in law, regulations or related
interpretations occur in adverse tax or other consequences that affect capital structure, intercompany interest rates and legal structure.
If we are unable to successfully manage any such risks, any one or more could materially and negatively affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations. 

We
have incurred losses and may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability in the future. 

We have incurred net losses
in the past and had an accumulated deficit of 458.4 million as of September 29, 2024. We will continue to incur net losses as spending
increases to finance the expansion of operations, installation, engineering, administrative, sales and marketing staffs, spending increases
on brand awareness and other sales and marketing initiatives and implement internal systems and infrastructure to support the company s
growth. We do not know whether revenue will grow rapidly enough to absorb these costs, and our limited operating history makes it difficult
to assess the extent of these expenses or their impact on results of operations. Our ability to achieve profitability depends on a number
of factors, including but not limited to: 

Growing the customer base; 

Maintaining or further
 lowering the cost of capital; 

Reducing the cost of components
 for our solar service offerings; 

Growing and maintaining
 our channel partner network; 

Growing our direct-to-consumer
 business to scale; and 

Reducing operating costs
 by lowering customer acquisition costs and optimizing our design and installation processes and supply chain logistics. 

63 

Even
if we do achieve profitability, we may be unable to sustain or increase profitability in the future. 

A
material drop in the retail price of utility-generated electricity or electricity from other sources could adversely impact our ability
to attract customers, which would harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

We
believe a homeowner s decision to buy solar energy from us is primarily driven by a desire to lower electricity costs. Decreases
in the retail prices of electricity from utilities or other energy sources would harm our ability to offer competitive pricing and could
harm its business. The price of electricity from utilities could decrease as a result of: 

the construction of a significant
 number of new power generation plants, including nuclear, coal, natural gas or renewable energy technologies; 

the construction of additional
 electric transmission and distribution lines; 

a reduction in the price
 of natural gas or other natural resources as a result of new drilling techniques or other technological developments, a relaxation
 of associated regulatory standards, or broader economic or policy developments; 

energy conservation technologies
 and public initiatives to reduce electricity consumption; 

subsidies impacting electricity
 prices, including in connection with electricity generation and transmission; and 

development of new energy
 technologies that provide less expensive energy. 

A
reduction in utility electricity prices would make the purchase of our solar service offerings less attractive. If the retail price of
energy available from utilities were to decrease due to any of these or other reasons, we would be at a competitive disadvantage. As
a result, we may be unable to attract new homeowners and growth would be limited. 

We
face competition from both traditional energy companies and renewable energy companies. 

The
solar energy and renewable energy industries are both highly competitive and continually evolving as participants strive to distinguish
themselves within their markets and compete with large utilities. Our primary competitors are the traditional utilities that supply energy
to potential customers. We compete with these utilities primarily based on price, predictability of price and the ease by which customers
can switch to electricity generated by our solar energy systems. If we cannot offer compelling value to its customers based on these
factors, then our business will not grow. Utilities generally have substantially greater financial, technical, operational and other
resources than us. As a result of their greater size, these competitors may be able to devote more resources to the research, development,
promotion and sale of their products or respond more quickly to evolving industry standards and changes in market conditions than we
can. Utilities could also offer other value- added products and services that could help them compete with us even if the cost of electricity
they offer is higher than ours. In addition, a majority of utilities sources of electricity is non-solar, which may allow utilities
to sell electricity more cheaply than electricity generated by our solar energy systems. 

Our
business is concentrated in certain markets including California, putting us at risk of region-specific disruptions. 

As
of September 29, 2024, a substantial portion of our installations were in California. We expect much of its near-term future growth to
occur in California, further concentrating our customer base and operational infrastructure. Accordingly, our business and operations
results are particularly susceptible to adverse economic, regulatory, pollical, weather, and other conditions in this market and other
markets that may become similarly concentrated. We may not have adequate insurance, including business interruption insurance, to compensate
for losses that may occur from any such significant events. A significant natural disaster could have a material adverse impact on our
business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, acts of terrorism or malicious computer viruses could cause disruptions
in our business, our partners businesses or the economy as a whole. To the extent that these disruptions result in delays or cancellations
of installations or the deployment of solar service offerings, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely
affected. 

64 

Our
growth strategy depends on the widespread adoption of solar power technology. 

The
distributed residential solar energy market is at a relatively early stage of development compared to fossil fuel-based electricity generation.
If additional demand for distributed residential solar energy systems fails to develop sufficiently or takes longer to develop than we
anticipate, the company may be unable to originate additional solar service agreements and related solar energy systems and energy storage
systems to grow the business. In addition, demand for solar energy systems and energy storage systems in our targeted markets may not
develop to the extent it anticipates. As a result, we may need to successfully broaden our customer base through origination of solar
service agreements and related solar energy systems and energy storage systems within its current markets or in new markets we may enter. 

Many
factors may affect the demand for solar energy systems, including, but not limited to, the following: 

availability, substance
 and magnitude of solar support programs including government targets, subsidies, incentives, renewable portfolio standards and residential
 net metering rules; 

the relative pricing of
 other conventional and non-renewable energy sources, such as natural gas, coal, oil and other fossil fuels, wind, utility-scale solar,
 nuclear, geothermal and biomass; 

performance, reliability
 and availability of energy generated by solar energy systems compared to conventional and other non-solar renewable energy sources; 

availability and performance
 of energy storage technology, the ability to implement such technology for use in conjunction with solar energy systems and the cost
 competitiveness such technology provides to customers as compared to costs for those customers reliant on the conventional electrical
 grid; and 

general economic conditions
 and the level of interest rates. 

The
residential solar energy industry is constantly evolving, which makes it difficult to evaluate our prospects. We cannot be certain if
historical growth rates reflect future opportunities, or its anticipated growth will be realized. The failure of distributed residential
solar energy to achieve, or its being significantly delayed in achieving, widespread adoption could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Our
business could be adversely affected by seasonal trends, poor weather, labor shortages, and construction cycles. 

Our
business is subject to significant industry-specific seasonal fluctuations. In the U.S., many customers make purchasing decisions towards
the end of the year in order to take advantage of tax credits. In addition, sales in the new home development market are often tied to
construction market demands, which tend to follow national trends in construction, including declining sales during cold weather months. 

65 

Natural
disasters, terrorist activities, political unrest, economic volatility, and other outbreaks could disrupt our delivery and operations,
which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Global
pandemics or fear of spread of contagious diseases, such as Ebola virus disease (EVD), coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), Middle East
respiratory syndrome (MERS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), H1N1 flu, H7N9 flu, avian flu and monkeypox, as well as hurricanes,
earthquakes, tsunamis, or other natural disasters could disrupt our business operations, reduce or restrict operations and services,
incur significant costs to protect its employees and facilities, or result in regional or global economic distress, which may materially
and adversely affect business, financial condition, and results of operations. Actual or threatened war, terrorist activities, political
unrest, civil strife, future disruptions in access to bank deposits or lending commitments due to bank failures and other geopolitical
uncertainty could have a similar adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. On February 24, 2022,
the Russian Federation launched an invasion of Ukraine that has had an immediate impact on the global economy resulting in higher energy
prices and higher prices for certain raw materials and goods and services which in turn is contributing to higher inflation in the U.S.
and other countries across the globe with significant disruption to financial markets. We have outsourced product development and software
engineering in Ukraine, and we may potentially indirectly be adversely impacted any significant disruption it has caused and may continue
to escalate. Similarly, the current armed conflict in Israel and the Gaza Strip may impact our operations. Any one or more of these events
may impede our operation and delivery efforts and adversely affect sales results, or even for a prolonged period of time, which could
materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We cannot predict the full effects the
supply chain constraints will have on our business, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations at this time
due to numerous uncertainties. 

We
depend on a limited number of customers and sales contracts for a significant portion of revenues, and the loss of any customer or cancellation
of any contract may cause significant fluctuations or declines in revenues. 

In the thirty-nine weeks
ended September 29, 2024, no customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenues. In 2023, our top customer accounted for 55 of our
total revenues, while in 2022 another customer accounted for 47 of our total revenues from continuing operations. As a result of customer
concentration, our financial performance may fluctuate significantly from period to period based, among others, on exogenous circumstances
related to its clients. In addition, any one of the following events may materially adversely affect cash flows, revenues and results
of operations: 

reduction, delay or cancellation
 of orders from one or more significant customers; 

loss of one or more significant
 customers and failure to identify additional or replacement customers; 

failure of any significant
 customers to make timely payment for our products; or 

the customers becoming
 insolvent or having difficulties meeting their financial obligations for any reason. 

We
are exposed to the credit risk of customers and payment delinquencies on its accounts receivables. 

While
customer defaults have been immaterial to date, we expect that the risk of customer defaults may increase as we grow our business. If
we experience increased customer credit defaults, our revenue and our ability to raise new investment funds could be adversely affected.
If economic conditions worsen, certain of our customers may face liquidity concerns and may be unable to satisfy their payment obligations
to us on a timely basis or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

We may not realize
the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, including the transactions under the SunPower APA, and integration of these
acquisitions may disrupt our business. 

In November 2022, we acquired
The Solaria Corporation Solaria ), after which Complete Solar was renamed Complete Solaria, Inc. In October
2023, we sold the solar panel assets of Solaria, including intellectual property and customer contracts, to Maxeon Solar Technologies,
Ltd., which resulted in an impairment loss of 147.5 million and loss on disposal of 1.8 million. Also, in July 2024, we acquired selected
assets of Core Energy. On August 5, 2024, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the APA among the Company, SunPower
Corporation and its direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively SunPower providing for the sale and purchase of certain
assets relating to SunPower s Blue Raven Solar business and certain assets relating to the new homes and non-installing dealer
network activities previously operated by SunPower (the Acquired Assets ). The APA was entered into in connection with a
voluntary petition filed by SunPower under Chapter 11 of the United States Code, 11 U.S.C. 101-1532 Bankruptcy Code ).
The sale by SunPower was approved on September 23, 2024, by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. The Company
completed the acquisition of the Acquired Assets effective September 30, 2024 in consideration for a cash purchase price of 45.0 million. 

In addition to these transactions, in the future,
we may acquire additional companies, project pipelines, products, or technologies, or enter into joint ventures or other strategic initiatives. 

66 

Additionally, our ability as
an organization to integrate acquisitions, including with respect to the assets acquired under the APA with SunPower (the SunPower
Acquisition ), is unproven. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions or any other future acquisition or
the acquisition may be viewed negatively by customers, financial markets or investors. 

The SunPower Acquisition and other acquisitions have numerous risks,
including, but not limited to, the following: 

difficulty in assimilating
 the operations and personnel of the acquired company; 

difficulty or inability to fund or finance the expanded business operations

inability to assert that
 internal controls over financial reporting are effective; and 

inability to obtain, or
 obtain in a timely manner, approvals from governmental authorities, which could delay or prevent such acquisitions.

We
depend on our intellectual property and may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be time-consuming and costly to
defend and could result in the loss of significant rights. 

From
time to time, we and our customers, or the third parties with whom we work may receive letters, including letters from other third parties,
and may become subject to lawsuits with such third parties alleging infringement of their patents. Additionally, we are required by contract
to indemnify some customers and third-party intellectual property providers for certain costs and damages of patent infringement in circumstances
where our products are a factor creating the customer s or these third-party providers infringement liability. This practice
may subject us to significant indemnification claims by customers and third-party providers. We cannot assure investors that indemnification
claims will not be made or that these claims will not harm our business, operating results or financial condition. Intellectual property
litigation is very expensive and time-consuming and could divert management s attention from our business and could have a material
adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. If there is a successful claim of infringement against us,
our customers or our third-party intellectual property providers, we may be required to pay substantial damages to the party claiming
infringement, stop selling products or using technology that contains the allegedly infringing intellectual property, or enter into royalty
or license agreements that may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Parties making infringement claims may also be able to
bring an action before the International Trade Commission that could result in an order stopping the importation into the U.S. of our
solar products. Any of these judgments could materially damage our business. We may have to develop non-infringing technology, and our
failure in doing so or in obtaining licenses to the proprietary rights on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on the
business. 

We
may be required to file claims against other parties for infringing its intellectual property that may be costly and may not be resolved
in its favor. 

To
protect our intellectual property rights and to maintain competitive advantage, we have filed, and may continue to file, suits against
parties we believe infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property. Intellectual property litigation is expensive and time-consuming,
could divert management s attention from our business, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results,
or financial condition, and our enforcement efforts may not be successful. In addition, the validity of our patents may be challenged
in such litigation. Our participation in intellectual property enforcement actions may negatively impact our financial results. 

Developments
in technology or improvements in distributed solar energy generation and related technologies or components may materially adversely
affect demand for our offerings. 

Significant
developments in technology, such as advances in distributed solar power generation, energy storage solutions such as batteries, energy
storage management systems, the widespread use or adoption of fuel cells for residential or commercial properties or improvements in
other forms of distributed or centralized power production may materially and adversely affect demand for our offerings and otherwise
affect our business. Future technological advancements may result in reduced prices to consumers or more efficient solar energy systems
than those available today, either of which may result in current customer dissatisfaction. We may not be able to adopt these new technologies
as quickly as its competitors or on a cost-effective basis. 

Additionally,
recent technological advancements may impact our business in ways not currently anticipated. Any failure by us to adopt or have access
to new or enhanced technologies or processes, or to react to changes in existing technologies, could result in product obsolescence or
the loss of competitiveness of and decreased consumer interest in its solar energy services, which could have a material adverse effect
on its business, financial condition and results of operations. 

68 

Our
business is subject to complex and evolving data protection laws. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain
interpretation and could result in claims, increased cost of operations or otherwise harm its business. 

Consumer
personal privacy and data security have become significant issues and the subject of rapidly evolving regulation in the U.S. Furthermore,
federal, state and local government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted, and may in the future adopt, more laws and regulations
affecting data privacy. For example, the state of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 CCPA ),
and California voters recently approved the California Privacy Rights Act CPRA ). The CCPA creates individual privacy rights
for consumers and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling the personal data of consumers or households.
The CCPA went into effect in January 2020, and it requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, provides
such consumers, business-to-business contacts and employees new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, and allows
for a new private right of action for data breaches. The CPRA modifies the CCPA and imposes additional data protection obligations on
companies doing business in California, including additional consumer rights processes and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data.
The CCPA and the CPRA may significantly impact Complete Solaria s business activities and require substantial compliance costs
that adversely affect its business, operating results, prospects and financial condition. To date, we have not experienced substantial
compliance costs in connection with fulfilling the requirements under the CCPA or CPRA. However, we cannot be certain that compliance
costs will not increase in the future with respect to the CCPA and CPRA or any other recently passed consumer privacy regulation. 

Outside
the U.S., an increasing number of laws, regulations, and industry standards may govern data privacy and security. For example, the European
Union s General Data Protection Regulation EU GDPR and the United Kingdom s GDPR UK GDPR impose strict requirements for processing personal data. Under the EU GDPR, companies may face temporary or definitive bans on data processing
and other corrective actions; fines of up to 20 million Euros or 4 of annual global revenue, whichever is greater; or private litigation
related to processing of personal data brought by classes of data subjects or consumer protection organizations authorized at law to
represent their interests. Non-compliance with the UK GDPR may result in substantially similar adverse consequences to those in relation
to the EU GDPR, including monetary penalties of up to 17.5 million or 4 of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. 

In
addition, we may be unable to transfer personal data from Europe and other jurisdictions to the U.S. or other countries due to data localization
requirements or limitations on cross-border data flows. Europe and other jurisdictions have enacted laws requiring data to be localized
or limiting the transfer of personal data to other countries. In particular, the European Economic Area EEA and
the United Kingdom have significantly restricted the transfer of personal data to the U.S. and other countries whose privacy laws it
believes are not adequate. Other jurisdictions may adopt similarly stringent interpretations of their data localization and cross- border
data transfer laws. Although there are currently various mechanisms that may be used to transfer personal data from the EEA and UK to
the U.S. in compliance with law, such as the EEA and UK s standard contractual clauses, these mechanisms are subject to legal challenges,
and there is no assurance that Complete Solaria can satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal data to the U.S.
If there is no lawful manner for us to transfer personal data from the EEA, the UK, or other jurisdictions to the U.S., or if the requirements
for a legally-compliant transfer are too onerous, we could face significant adverse consequences, including the interruption or degradation
of its operations, the need to relocate part of or all of its business or data processing activities to other jurisdictions at significant
expense, increased exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines and penalties, the inability to transfer data and work with partners,
vendors and other third parties, and injunctions against its processing or transferring of personal data necessary to operate its business.
Some European regulators have ordered certain companies to suspend or permanently cease certain transfers out of Europe for allegedly
violating the EU GDPR s cross-border data transfer limitations. 

Any
inability to adequately address privacy and security concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable privacy and data security
laws, regulations and policies, could result in additional cost and liability to us damage our reputation, inhibit sales and adversely
affect our business. Furthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the laws, regulations and policies that
are applicable to our business may limit the use and adoption of, and reduce the overall demand for, its solutions. If we are not able
to adjust to changing laws, regulations and standards related to privacy or security, our business may be harmed. 

69 

Any
unauthorized access to or disclosure or theft of personal information we gather, store or use could harm our reputation and subject us
to claims or litigation. 

We
receive, store and use personal information of customers, including names, addresses, e-mail addresses, and other housing and energy
use information. We also store information of dealers, including employee, financial and operational information. We rely on the availability
of data collected from customers and dealers in order to manage our business and market our offerings. We take certain steps in an effort
to protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of the personal information collected, stored or transmitted, but there is no
guarantee inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure will not occur or third parties will not gain unauthorized access to this information
despite our efforts. Although we take precautions to provide for disaster recovery, our ability to recover systems or data may be expensive
and may interfere with normal operations. Also, although we obtain assurances from such third parties that they will use reasonable safeguards
to secure their systems, we may be adversely affected by unavailability of their systems or unauthorized use or disclosure or its data
maintained in such systems. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally
are not identified until they are launched against a target, our suppliers or vendors and our dealers may be unable to anticipate these
techniques or to implement adequate preventative or mitigation measures. 

Cyberattacks
in particular are becoming more sophisticated and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized
access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, disruption of customers 
operations, loss or damage to data delivery systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, corruption
of data and increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as advanced
persistent threats, may remain undetected for an extended period. 

Unauthorized
use, disclosure of or access to any personal information maintained by us or on the behalf of us, whether through breach of our systems,
breach of the systems of our suppliers, vendors or dealers by an unauthorized party or through employee or contractor error, theft or
misuse or otherwise, could harm our business. If any such unauthorized use, disclosure of or access to such personal information were
to occur, our operations could be seriously disrupted and we could be subject to demands, claims and litigation by private parties and
investigations, related actions and penalties by regulatory authorities. 

In
addition, we could incur significant costs in notifying affected persons and entities and otherwise complying with the multitude of federal,
state and local laws and regulations relating to the unauthorized access to, use of or disclosure of personal information. Finally, any
perceived or actual unauthorized access to, use of or disclosure of such information could harm our reputation, substantially impair
our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we currently maintain cybersecurity insurance, such insurance may
not be sufficient to cover against claims, and we cannot be certain that cyber insurance will continue to be available on economically
reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. 

If
we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to interactions by the company or its dealers with current or prospective residential
customers could result in negative publicity, claims, investigations and litigation and adversely affect financial performance. 

Our
business substantially focuses on solar service agreements and transactions with residential customers. We offer leases, loans and other
products and services to consumers by contractors in our dealer networks, who utilize sales people employed by or engaged as third-party
service providers of such contractors. We and our dealers must comply with numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations that
govern matters relating to interactions with residential consumers, including those pertaining to consumer protection, marketing and
sales, privacy and data security, consumer financial and credit transactions, mortgages and refinancings, home improvement contracts,
warranties and various means of customer solicitation, including under the laws described below in As sales to residential
customers have grown, we have increasingly become subject to substantial financing and consumer protection laws and regulations. 
These laws and regulations are dynamic and subject to potentially differing interpretations and various federal, state and local legislative
and regulatory bodies may initiate investigations, expand current laws or regulations, or enact new laws and regulations regarding these
matters. Changes in these laws or regulations or their interpretation could dramatically affect how we and our dealers do business, acquire
customers and manage and use information collected from and about current and prospective customers and the costs associated therewith.
We and our dealers strive to comply with all applicable laws and regulations relating to interactions with residential customers. It
is possible, however, these requirements may be interpreted and applied in a manner inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and
may conflict with other rules or our practices or the practices of our dealers. 

70 

Although
we require dealers to meet consumer compliance requirements, we do not control dealers and their suppliers or their business practices.
Accordingly, we cannot guarantee they follow ethical business practices such as fair wage practices and compliance with environmental,
safety and other local laws. A lack of demonstrated compliance could lead us to seek alternative dealers or suppliers, which could increase
costs and have a negative effect on business and prospects for growth. Violation of labor or other laws by our dealers or suppliers or
the divergence of a dealer or supplier s labor or other practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the U.S. or other
markets in which the company does or intends to do business could also attract negative publicity and harm the business. 

From
time to time, we have been included in lawsuits brought by the consumer customers of certain contractors in our networks, citing claims
based on the sales practices of these contractors. While we have paid only minimal damages to date, we cannot be sure that a court of
law would not determine that we are liable for the actions of the contractors in our networks or that a regulator or state attorney general s
office may hold us accountable for violations of consumer protection or other applicable laws by. Our risk mitigation processes may not
be sufficient to mitigate financial harm associated with violations of applicable law by our contractors or ensure that any such contractor
is able to satisfy its indemnification obligations to us. Any significant judgment against us could expose it to broader liabilities,
a need to adjust our distribution channels for products and services or otherwise change our business model and could adversely impact
the business. 

We
may be unsuccessful in introducing new services and product offerings. 

We
intend to introduce new offerings of services and products to both new and existing customers in the future, including home automation
products and additional home technology solutions. We may be unsuccessful in significantly broadening our customer base through the addition
of these services and products within current markets or in new markets the company may enter. Additionally, we may not be successful
in generating substantial revenue from any additional services and products introduced in the future and may decline to initiate new
product and service offerings. 

Damage
to our brand and reputation or change or loss of use of our brand could harm our business and results of operations. 

We
depend significantly on our reputation for high-quality products, excellent customer service and the brand name Complete Solaria 
to attract new customers and grow our business. If we fail to continue to deliver solar energy systems or energy storage systems within
the planned timelines, if our offerings do not perform as anticipated or if we damage any of our customers properties or delays
or cancels projects, our brand and reputation could be significantly impaired. Future technological improvements may allow the company
to offer lower prices or offer new technology to new customers; however, technical limitations in our current solar energy systems and
energy storage systems may prevent us from offering such lower prices or new technology to existing customers. 

In
addition, given the sheer number of interactions our personnel or dealers operating on our behalf have with customers and potential customers,
it is inevitable that some customers and potential customers interactions with us or dealers operating on our behalf will
be perceived as less than satisfactory. This has led to instances of customer complaints, some of which have affected our digital footprint
on rating websites and social media platforms. If we cannot manage hiring and training processes to avoid or minimize these issues to
the extent possible, our reputation may be harmed and our ability to attract new customers would suffer. 

In
addition, if we were to no longer use, lose the right to continue to use or if others use the Complete Solaria brand, we
could lose recognition in the marketplace among customers, suppliers and dealers, which could affect our business, financial condition,
results of operations and would require financial and other investment and management attention in new branding, which may not be as
successful. 

71 

Our
success depends on the continuing contributions of key personnel. 

We
rely heavily on the services of our key executive officers and the loss of services of any principal member of the management team could
adversely affect operations. There have been, and from time to time there may continue to be, changes in our management team resulting
from the hiring or departure of executives and key employees, or the transition of executives within our business, which could disrupt
our business. 

We
are investing significant resources in developing new members of management as we complete our restructuring and strategic transformation.
We also anticipate that over time we will need to hire a number of highly skilled technical, sales, marketing, administrative, and accounting
personnel. The competition for qualified personnel is intense in this industry. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining
sufficient numbers of qualified personnel to support its anticipated growth. We cannot guarantee that any employee will remain employed
with us for any definite period of time since all employees, including key executive officers, serve at-will and may terminate their
employment at any time for any reason. 

If
we or our dealers or suppliers fail to hire and retain sufficient employees and service providers in key functions, our growth and ability
to timely complete customer projects and successfully manage customer accounts would be constrained. 

To
support growth, we and our dealers need to hire, train, deploy, manage and retain a substantial number of skilled employees, engineers,
installers, electricians and sales and project finance specialists. Competition for qualified personnel in this industry has increased
substantially, particularly for skilled personnel involved in the installation of solar energy systems. We and our dealers also compete
with the homebuilding and construction industries for skilled labor. These industries are cyclical and when participants in these industries
seek to hire additional workers, it puts upward pressure on us and our dealers labor costs. Companies with whom our dealers compete
to hire installers may offer compensation or incentive plans that certain installers may view as more favorable. As a result, our dealers
may be unable to attract or retain qualified and skilled installation personnel. The further unionization of the industry s labor
force or the homebuilding and construction industries labor forces could also increase our dealers labor costs. 

Shortages
of skilled labor could significantly delay a project or otherwise increase dealers costs. Further, we need to continue to increase
the training of the customer service team to provide high-end account management and service to homeowners before, during and following
the point of installation of its solar energy systems. Identifying and recruiting qualified personnel and training them requires significant
time, expense and attention. It can take several months before a new customer service team member is fully trained and productive at
the standards established by us. If we are unable to hire, develop and retain talented customer service or other personnel, we may not
be able to grow our business. 

Our
operating results and ability to grow may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year, which could make future performance difficult
to predict and could cause operating results for a particular period to fall below expectations. 

Our
quarterly and annual operating results and its ability to grow are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly. We have experienced
seasonal and quarterly fluctuations in the past and expect to experience such fluctuations in the future. In addition to the other risks
described in this Risk Factors section, the following factors could cause operating results to fluctuate: 

expiration or initiation
 of any governmental rebates or incentives; 

72 

significant fluctuations
in customer demand for our solar energy services, solar energy systems and energy storage systems, including as a result of changes in
interest rates; 

our dealers ability
 to complete installations in a timely manner; 

our and our dealers 
 ability to gain interconnection permission for an installed solar energy system from the relevant utility; 

the availability, terms
 and costs of suitable financing; 

the amount, timing of sales
 and potential decreases in value of Solar Renewable Energy Certificates SRECs 

our ability to continue
 to expand its operations and the amount and timing of expenditures related to this expansion; 

announcements by us or
 our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital-raising activities or commitments; 

changes in our pricing
 policies or terms or those of competitors, including centralized electric utilities; 

actual or anticipated developments
 in competitors businesses, technology or the competitive landscape; and 

natural disasters or other
 weather or meteorological conditions. 

For
these or other reasons, the results of any prior quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as indications of our future performance. 

Our
ability to obtain insurance on the terms of any available insurance coverage could be materially adversely affected by international,
national, state or local events or company-specific events, as well as the financial condition of insurers. 

Our
insurance policies cover legal and contractual liabilities arising out of bodily injury, personal injury or property damage to third
parties and are subject to policy limits. 

However,
such policies do not cover all potential losses, and coverage is not always available in the insurance market on commercially reasonable
terms. In addition, we may have disagreements with insurers on the amount of recoverable damages and the insurance proceeds received
for any loss of, or any damage to, any of our assets may be claimed by lenders under financing arrangements or otherwise may not be sufficient
to restore the loss or damage without a negative impact on its results of operations. Furthermore, the receipt of insurance proceeds
may be delayed, requiring us to use cash or incur financing costs in the interim. To the extent our experiences covered losses under
its insurance policies, the limit of our coverage for potential losses may be decreased or the insurance rates it has to pay increased.
Furthermore, the losses insured through commercial insurance are subject to the credit risk of those insurance companies. While we believe
our commercial insurance providers are currently creditworthy, we cannot assure such insurance companies will remain so in the future. 

We
may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount desired at reasonable rates. The insurance coverage obtained may
contain large deductibles or fail to cover certain risks or all potential losses. In addition, our insurance policies are subject to
annual review by insurers and may not be renewed on similar or favorable terms, including coverage, deductibles or premiums, or at all.
If a significant accident or event occurs for which we are not fully insured or the company suffers losses due to one or more of its
insurance carriers defaulting on their obligations or contesting their coverage obligations, it could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We
may be subject to breaches of our information technology systems, which could lead to disclosure of internal information, damage to our
reputation or relationships with dealers, suppliers, and customers, and disrupt access to online services. Such breaches could subject
us to significant reputational, financial, legal, and operational consequences. 

Our
business requires the use and storage of confidential and proprietary information, intellectual property, commercial banking information,
personal information concerning customers, employees, and business partners, and corporate information concerning internal processes
and business functions. Malicious attacks to gain access to such information affects many companies across various industries, including
ours. 

73 

Where
appropriate, we use encryption and authentication technologies to secure the transmission and storage of data. These security measures
may be compromised as a result of third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management, or other irregularity
or malicious effort, and result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to data. 

We
devote resources to network security, data encryption, and other security measures to protect our systems and data, but these security
measures cannot provide absolute security. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or
sabotage systems change frequently, target end users through phishing and other malicious techniques, and/or may be difficult to detect
for long periods of time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. As a result, we
may experience a breach of our systems in the future that reduces our ability to protect sensitive data. In addition, hardware, software,
or applications we develop or procures from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly
compromise information security. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through fraud, trickery
or other forms of deceiving team members, contractors and temporary staff. If we experience, or are perceived to have experienced, a
significant data security breach, fail to detect and appropriately respond to a significant data security breach, or fail to implement
disclosure controls and procedures that provide for timely disclosure of data security breaches deemed material to our business, including
corrections or updates to previous disclosures, we could be exposed to a risk of loss, increased insurance costs, remediation and prospective
prevention costs, damage to our reputation and brand, litigation and possible liability, or government enforcement actions, any of which
could detrimentally affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 

We
may also share information with contractors and third-party providers to conduct business. While we generally review and typically request
or require such contractors and third-party providers to implement security measures, such as encryption and authentication technologies
to secure the transmission and storage of data, those third-party providers may experience a significant data security breach, which
may also detrimentally affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition as discussed above. See also under this section,
 We may be required to file claims against other parties for infringing its intellectual property that may be costly and may
not be resolved in our favor . We rely substantially upon trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary
rights, and, if these rights are not sufficiently protected, our ability to compete and generate revenue could suffer. 

As
sales to residential customers have grown, we have increasingly become subject to consumer protection laws and regulations. 

As
we continue to seek to expand our retail customer base, our activities with customers are subject to consumer protection laws that may
not be applicable to other businesses, such as federal truth-in-lending, consumer leasing, telephone and digital marketing, and equal
credit opportunity laws and regulations, as well as state and local finance laws and regulations. Claims arising out of actual or alleged
violations of law may be asserted against us by individuals or governmental entities and may expose the company to significant damages
or other penalties, including fines. In addition, our affiliations with third-party dealers may subject the company to alleged liability
in connection with actual or alleged violations of law by such dealers, whether or not actually attributable to us, which may expose
us to significant damages and penalties, and we may incur substantial expenses in defending against legal actions related to third-party
dealers, whether or not ultimately found liable. 

The
competitive environment in which we operate often requires the undertaking of customer obligations, which may turn out to be costlier
than anticipated and, in turn, materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

We
are often required, at the request of our end customer, to undertake certain obligations such as: 

system output performance
 warranties; and 

system maintenance. 

74 

Such
customer obligations involve complex accounting analyses and judgments regarding the timing of revenue and expense recognition, and in
certain situations these factors may require us to defer revenue or profit recognition until projects are completed or until contingencies
are resolved, which could adversely affect revenues and profits in a particular period. 

We
are subject to risks associated with construction, cost overruns, delays, regulatory compliance and other contingencies, any of which
could have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations. 

We
are a licensed contractor in certain communities that we service and are ultimately responsible as the contracting party for every solar
energy system installation. A significant portion of our business depends on obtaining and maintaining required licenses in various jurisdictions.
All such licenses are subject to audit by the relevant government agency. Our failure to obtain or maintain required licenses could result
in the termination of certain of our contracts. For example, we hold a license with California s Contractors State License Board
(the CSLB and that license is currently under probation with the CSLB. If we fail to comply with the CSLB s
law and regulations, it could result in termination of certain of our contracts, monetary penalties, extension of the license probation
period or revocation of its license in California. In addition, we may be liable, either directly or through its solar partners, to homeowners
for any damage we cause to them, their home, belongings or property during the installation of our systems. For example, we either directly
or through its solar partners, frequently penetrate homeowners roofs during the installation process and may incur liability for
the failure to adequately weatherproof such penetrations following the completion of construction. In addition, because the solar energy
systems we or our solar partners deploy are high voltage energy systems, we may incur liability for failing to comply with electrical
standards and manufacturer recommendations. 

Further,
we or our solar partners may face construction delays or cost overruns, which may adversely affect our or our solar partners ability
to ramp up the volume of installation in accordance with our plans. Such delays or overruns may occur as a result of a variety of factors,
such as labor shortages, defects in materials and workmanship, adverse weather conditions, transportation constraints, construction change
orders, site changes, labor issues and other unforeseen difficulties, any of which could lead to increased cancellation rates, reputational
harm and other adverse effects. 

In
addition, the installation of solar energy systems, energy storage systems, and other energy-related products requiring building modifications
are subject to oversight and regulation in accordance with national, state, and local laws and ordinances relating to building, fire,
and electrical codes, safety, environmental protection, utility interconnection and metering, and related matters. We also rely on certain
employees to maintain professional licenses in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate, and the failure to employ properly licensed
personnel could adversely affect our licensing status in those jurisdictions. It is difficult and costly to track the requirements of
every individual authority having jurisdiction over our installations and to design solar energy systems to comply with these varying
standards. Any new government regulations or utility policies pertaining to our systems may result in significant additional expenses
to homeowners and us and, as a result, could cause a significant reduction in demand for solar service offerings. 

While
we have a variety of stringent quality standards that the company applies in the selection of its solar partners, we do not control our
suppliers and solar partners or their business practices. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that they follow our standards or ethical
business practices, such as fair wage practices and compliance with environmental, safety and other local laws. A lack of demonstrated
compliance could lead us to seek alternative suppliers or contractors, which could increase costs and result in delayed delivery or installation
of our products, product shortages or other disruptions of its operations. Violation of labor or other laws by our suppliers and solar
partners or the divergence of a supplier s or solar partners labor or other practices from those generally accepted as ethical
in the U.S. or other markets in which we do business could also attract negative publicity and harm our business, brand and reputation
in the market. 

Our
management has identified conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

Since our inception, we have
incurred losses and negative cash flows from operations. We incurred net losses from continuing operations of 101.4 million and 96.2
million, during the thirty-nine week period ended September 29, 2024 and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, and had
an accumulated deficit of 458.4 million and debt and derivative liabilities totaling 202.0 million as of September 29, 2024. We had
cash and cash equivalents of 79.5 million, excluding restricted cash of 3.8 million, as of September 29, 2024, of which we used 45.0
million in the acquisition of certain assets of SunPower subsequent to September 29, 2024 and the remaining balance was held for working
capital expenditures. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue
as a going concern requires that we obtain sufficient funding to meet our obligations and finance our operations. 

75 

If
we are not able to secure adequate additional funding when needed, we will need to reevaluate our operating plan and may be forced to
make reductions in spending, extend payment terms with suppliers, liquidate assets where possible, or suspend or curtail planned programs
or cease operations entirely. These actions could materially impact our business, results of operations and future prospects. There can
be no assurance that in the event we require additional financing, such financing will be available on terms that are favorable, or at
all. Failure to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, raise additional capital or reduce certain discretionary spending would
have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our intended business objectives. 

We
expect that we will need to raise additional funding to finance our operations. This additional financing may not be available on acceptable
terms or at all. Failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed may force us to curtail planned programs or cease operations entirely. 

Our
operations have consumed significant amounts of cash since inception. We expect to incur significant operating expenses as we continue
to grow our business. We believe that our operating losses and negative operating cash flows will continue into the foreseeable future. 

We
had cash and cash equivalents of 79.5 million, excluding restricted cash of 3.8 million, as of September 29, 2024. Subsequent to September
29, 2024, we used 45.0 million for the acquisition of certain assets of SunPower. Our cash position raises substantial doubt regarding
our ability to continue as a going concern for 12 months after the consolidated financial statements issuance. We will require substantial
additional capital to continue operations. Such additional capital might not be available when we need it, and our actual cash requirements
might be greater than anticipated. We cannot be certain that additional capital will be available on attractive terms, if at all, when
needed, which could be dilutive to stockholders, and our financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects could be
materially and adversely affected. 

We
have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting. If we are unable to maintain effective internal
controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, the accuracy and timeliness of our financial and operating
reporting may be adversely affected, and confidence in our operations and disclosures may be lost. 

In
connection with the preparation and audit of our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and our consolidated
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, our management identified a material weakness in our internal control over
financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting
such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will
not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weakness is as follows: 

We do not have sufficient
 full-time accounting personnel, (i) to enable appropriate reviews over the financial close and reporting process, (ii) to allow for
 appropriate segregation of duties, and (iii) with the requisite experience and technical accounting knowledge to identify, review
 and resolve complex accounting issues under generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. GAAP ). Additionally,
 we did not adequately design and/or implement controls related to conducting a formal risk assessment process. 

76 

In
connection with the preparation and audit of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, our management
identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. The material weakness is as follows: 

Inventory controls related
 to the completeness, existence, and cut-off of inventories held at third parties, and controls related to the calculation of adjustments
 to inventory for items considered excessive and obsolete. 

Had
such an evaluation been performed, additional control deficiencies may have been identified by the Company s management, and those
control deficiencies could have also represented one or more material weaknesses. 

Complete
Solaria was not required to evaluate internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 in accordance with the provisions
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Had such an evaluation been performed, Complete Solaria s management may have identified additional
control deficiencies, and those control deficiencies could have also represented one or more material weaknesses. 

We
have taken certain steps, such as recruiting additional personnel, in addition to utilizing third-party consultants and specialists,
to supplement our internal resources, to enhance our internal control environment and plan to take additional steps to remediate the
material weaknesses. Although we plan to complete this remediation process as quickly as possible, we cannot estimate how long it will
take. We cannot assure that the measures we have taken to date, and may take in the future, will be sufficient to remediate the control
deficiencies that led to our material weakness in internal control over financial reporting or that such measures will prevent or avoid
potential future material weaknesses. 

If
we are not able to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, or if material
weaknesses are discovered in future periods, a risk that is significantly increased in light of the complexity of our business, we may
be unable to accurately and timely report our financial position, results of operations, cash flows or key operating metrics, which could
result in late filings of the annual and quarterly reports under the Exchange Act, restatements of financial statements or other corrective
disclosures, an inability to access commercial lending markets, defaults under its secured revolving credit facility and other agreements,
or other material adverse effects on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. 

Compliance
with occupational safety and health requirements and best practices can be costly, and noncompliance with such requirements may result
in potentially significant penalties, operational delays and adverse publicity. 

The
installation and ongoing operations and maintenance of solar energy systems and energy storage systems requires individuals hired by
us, our dealers, or third-party contractors, potentially including employees, to work at heights with complicated and potentially dangerous
electrical systems. The evaluation and modification of buildings as part of the installation process requires these individuals to work
in locations that may contain potentially dangerous levels of asbestos, lead, mold or other materials known or believed to be hazardous
to human health. There is substantial risk of serious injury or death if proper safety procedures are not followed. Our operations are
subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA and the Department of Transportation DOT and equivalent state and local laws. Changes to OSHA or DOT requirements, or stricter interpretation or enforcement
of existing laws or regulations, could result in increased costs. If we fail to comply with applicable OSHA or DOT regulations, even
if no work-related serious injury or death occurs, we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement and be required to pay substantial
penalties, incur significant capital expenditures or suspend or limit operations. Because individuals hired by us or on our behalf to
perform installation and ongoing operations and maintenance of the company s solar energy systems and energy storage systems, including
its dealers and third-party contractors, are compensated on a per project basis, they are incentivized to work more quickly than installers
compensated on an hourly basis. While we have not experienced a high level of injuries to date, this incentive structure may result in
higher injury rates than others in the industry and could accordingly expose the company to increased liability. Individuals hired by
or on behalf of us may have workplace accidents and receive citations from OSHA regulators for alleged safety violations, resulting in
fines. Any such accidents, citations, violations, injuries or failure to comply with industry best practices may subject us to adverse
publicity, damage its reputation and competitive position and adversely affect the business. 

77 

Our
business has benefited from the declining cost of solar energy system components, but it may be harmed if the cost of such components
stabilizes or increases in the future. 

Our
business has benefited from the declining cost of solar energy system components and to the extent such costs stabilize, decline at a
slower rate or increase, our future growth rate may be negatively impacted. The declining cost of solar energy system components and
the raw materials necessary to manufacture them has been a key driver in the price of our solar energy systems, and the prices charged
for electricity and customer adoption of solar energy. Solar energy system component and raw material prices may not continue to decline
at the same rate as they have over the past several years or at all. In addition, growth in the solar industry and the resulting increase
in demand for solar energy system components and the raw materials necessary to manufacture them may also put upward pressure on prices.
An increase of solar energy system components and raw materials prices could slow growth and cause business and results of operations
to suffer. Further, the cost of solar energy system components and raw materials has increased and could increase in the future due to
tariff penalties, duties, the loss of or changes in economic governmental incentives or other factors. 

Product
liability claims against us could result in adverse publicity and potentially significant monetary damages. 

It
is possible our solar energy systems or energy storage systems could injure customers or other third parties or our solar energy systems
or energy storage systems could cause property damage as a result of product malfunctions, defects, improper installation, fire or other
causes. Any product liability claim we face could be expensive to defend and may divert management s attention. The successful
assertion of product liability claims against us could result in potentially significant monetary damages, potential increases in insurance
expenses, penalties or fines, subject the company to adverse publicity, damage our reputation and competitive position and adversely
affect sales of solar energy systems or energy storage systems. In addition, product liability claims, injuries, defects or other problems
experienced by other companies in the residential solar industry could lead to unfavorable market conditions to the industry as a whole
and may have an adverse effect on our ability to expand its portfolio of solar service agreements and related solar energy systems and
energy storage systems, thus affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Our
warranty costs may exceed the warranty reserve. 

We
provide warranties that cover parts performance and labor to purchasers of our solar modules. We maintain a warranty reserve on our financial
statements, and our warranty claims may exceed the warranty reserve. Any significant warranty expenses could adversely affect our financial
condition and results of operations. Significant warranty problems could impair our reputation which could result in lower revenue and
a lower gross margin. 

We
are subject to legal proceedings and regulatory inquiries and may be named in additional claims or legal proceedings or become involved
in regulatory inquiries, all of which are costly, distracting to our core business and could result in an unfavorable outcome or harm
our business, financial condition, results of operations or the trading price for our securities. 

We
are involved in claims, legal proceedings that arise from normal business activities. In addition, from time to time, third parties may
assert claims against us. We evaluate all claims, lawsuits and investigations with respect to their potential merits, our potential defenses
and counter claims, settlement or litigation potential and the expected effect on us. In the event that we are involved in significant
disputes or are the subject of a formal action by a regulatory agency, we could be exposed to costly and time-consuming legal proceedings
that could result in any number of outcomes. Although outcomes of such actions vary, any claims, proceedings or regulatory actions initiated
by or against us whether successful or not, could result in expensive costs of defense, costly damage awards, injunctive relief, increased
costs of business, fines or orders to change certain business practices, significant dedication of management time, diversion of significant
operational resources or some other harm to the business. In any of these cases, our business, financial condition or results of operations
could be negatively impacted. We make a provision for a liability relating to legal matters when it is both probable that a liability
has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted
to reflect the impacts of negotiations, estimated settlements, legal rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events
pertaining to a particular matter. Depending on the nature and timing of any such controversy, an unfavorable resolution of a matter
could materially affect our future business, financial condition or results of operations, or all of the foregoing, in a particular quarter. 

78 

The
requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management s attention and affect our ability to attract
and retain qualified directors and officers. 

We
will face increased legal, accounting, administrative and other costs and expenses as a public company that we did not incur as a private
company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, including the requirements of Section 404, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented
by the SEC, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and the rules and regulations promulgated and to be
promulgated thereunder, the PCAOB and the securities exchanges, impose additional reporting and other obligations on public companies.
Compliance with public company requirements will increase costs and make certain activities more time- consuming. A number of those requirements
will require us to carry out activities we had not done previously. 

If
any issues in complying with those requirements are identified (for example, if we or the auditors identify a material weakness or significant
deficiency in the internal control over financial reporting), we could incur additional costs rectifying those issues, and the existence
of those issues could adversely affect our reputation or investor perceptions of it. It may also be more expensive to obtain director
and officer liability insurance. Risks associated with our status as a public company may make it more difficult to attract and retain
qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers. The additional reporting and other obligations imposed
by these rules and regulations will increase legal and financial compliance costs and the costs of related legal, accounting and administrative
activities. These increased costs will require us to divert a significant amount of money that could otherwise be used to expand the
business and achieve strategic objectives. Advocacy efforts by stockholders and third parties may also prompt additional changes in governance
and reporting requirements, which could further increase costs. 

Our
ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited. 

We
have incurred substantial losses during our history and do not expect to become profitable in the near future and may never achieve profitability.
Under current U.S. federal income tax law, unused losses for the tax year ended December 31, 2017 and prior tax years will carry forward
to offset future taxable income, if any, until such unused losses expire, and unused federal losses generated after December 31, 2017
will not expire and may be carried forward indefinitely but will be only deductible to the extent of 80 of current year taxable income
in any given year. Many states have similar laws. 

In
addition, both current and future unused net operating loss NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes may be
subject to limitation under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), if a corporation
undergoes an ownership change, generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in equity ownership
by certain stockholders over a three-year period. The Business Combination may have resulted in an ownership change for us and, accordingly,
our NOL carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be subject to limitations (or disallowance) on their use after the Business
Combination. Our NOL carryforwards may also be subject to limitation as a result of prior shifts in equity ownership. Additional ownership
changes in the future could result in additional limitations on our NOL carryforwards. Consequently, even if we achieve profitability,
we may not be able to utilize a material portion of our NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes, which could have a material adverse
effect on cash flow and results of operations. 

The
trading price of our common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment. 

Fluctuations
in the price of our securities could contribute to the loss of all or part of your investment. Prior to the Business Combination, there
was no public market for Solaria s stock and trading in the shares of our common stock (prior to consummation of the Business Combination,
 FACT Common Stock was not active. Accordingly, the valuation ascribed to Solaria and FACT Common Stock in the Business
Combination may not have been indicative of the price that will prevail in the trading market following the Business Combination. If
an active market for our securities develops and continues, the trading price of our securities could be volatile and subject to wide
fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Any of the factors listed below could have a material
adverse effect on your investment in our securities and our securities may trade at prices significantly below the price you paid for
them. In such circumstances, the trading price of our securities may not recover and may experience a further decline. 

79 

Factors
affecting the trading price of our securities: 

actual or anticipated fluctuations
 in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us; 

changes in the market s
 expectations about our operating results; 

success of competitors; 

our operating results failing
 to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period; 

changes in financial estimates
 and recommendations by securities analysts concerning us or the market in general; 

operating and stock price
 performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us; 

our ability to develop
 product candidates; 

changes in laws and regulations
 affecting our business; 

commencement of, or involvement
 in, litigation involving us; 

changes in our capital
 structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt; 

the volume of shares of
 our securities available for public sale 

any major change in our
 board of directors or management; 

sales of substantial amounts
 of common stock by our directors, executive officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur; and 

general economic and political
 conditions such as recessions, interest rates, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations and acts of war or terrorism. 

If
securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business, or our market, or if they
change their recommendations regarding our securities adversely, the price and trading volume of our securities could decline. 

The
trading market for our securities is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us,
our business, our market, or our competitors. If any of the analysts who currently cover us change their recommendation regarding our
stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, the price of our securities would likely decline.
If any analyst who currently cover us were to cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility
in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. If we obtain additional coverage and any new
analyst issues, an adverse or misleading opinion regarding us, our business model, our intellectual property or our stock performance,
or if our operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts, our stock price could decline. 

A
market for our securities may not continue, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of our securities. 

The
price of our securities may fluctuate significantly due to general market and economic conditions and an active trading market for our
securities may not be sustained. In addition, the price of our securities can vary due to general economic conditions and forecasts,
our general business condition and the release of our financial reports. If our securities are not listed on, or become delisted from
Nasdaq for any reason, and are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, an inter-dealer automated quotation system for equity securities that
is not a national securities exchange, the liquidity and price of our securities may be more limited than if we were quoted or listed
on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange. You may be unable to sell your securities unless a market can be established or sustained. 

80 

There
can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the continued listing standards of Nasdaq. 

We
have not complied in the past, and we may not be able to comply in the future, with the continued listing standards of Nasdaq. On April
16, 2024, we received written notice NASDAQ Notice from Nasdaq notifying us that we were not in compliance with the minimum
bid price requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1) for continued listing on The Nasdaq Global Market. Nasdaq Listing Rule
5450(a)(1) requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of 1.00 per share, and Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that
a failure to meet the minimum bid price requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days.
We had 180 calendar days to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of
our common stock was required to be at least 1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days before October 14, 2024.
We subsequently satisfied this requirement and on June 3, 2024, we received written notice from the Nasdaq notifying the Company that
it had regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. 

Also on April 16, 2024, we received a letter NASDAQ Letter from the staff at Nasdaq notifying us that, for the 30 consecutive trading days prior to the date of the NASDAQ Letter, our common stock
had traded at a value below the minimum 50,000,000 Market Value of Listed Securities MVLS requirement set
forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(A), which is required for continued listing of our common stock on The Nasdaq Global Market. In
accordance with Nasdaq listing rule 5810(c)(3)(C), we had 180 calendar days, or until October 14, 2024, to regain compliance. The NASDAQ
Letter notes that to regain compliance, our common stock must trade at or above a level such that our MVLS closes at or above 50,000,000
for a minimum of ten consecutive business days during the compliance period, which ended October 14, 2024. The Company believes it has
satisfied the requirements of the NASDAQ Letter prior to the deadline. The Nasdaq staff has not provided written notice that the Company
has regained compliance with this requirement. 

If
Nasdaq delists our securities from trading on its exchange for failure to meet the listing standards, we and our stockholders could face
significant material adverse consequences including: 

a limited availability
 of market quotations for our securities; 

a determination that our
 common stock is a penny stock which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules,
 possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our common stock; 

a limited amount of analyst
 coverage; and a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. 

Sales
of a substantial number of our common stock in the public market by our shareholders could cause the price of our common stock to decline. 

Sales
of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. If our stockholders sell, or the
market perceives that our stockholders intend to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the market price
of our common stock could decline. 

81 

Provisions
in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may delay or prevent an acquisition
by a third party that could otherwise be in the interests of shareholders. 

Our
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws contain several provisions that may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to
acquire control of us without the approval of our board. These provisions, which may delay, prevent or deter a merger, acquisition, tender
offer, proxy contest, or other transaction that stockholders may consider favorable, include the following: 

advance notice requirements
 for stockholder proposals and director nominations; 

provisions limiting stockholders 
 ability to call special meetings of stockholders and to take action by written consent; 

restrictions on business
 combinations with interested stockholders; 

no cumulative voting; and 

the ability of the board
 of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used,
 among other things, to institute a rights plan that would have the effect of significantly diluting the stock ownership of a potential
 hostile acquirer, likely preventing acquisitions by such acquirer. 

These
provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Proposed Bylaws could discourage potential takeover attempts and reduce the price
that investors might be willing to pay for the shares of our common stock in the future, which could reduce the market price of our common
stock. 

The
provision of our Certificate of Incorporation requiring exclusive venue in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware and the federal
district courts of the U.S. for certain types of lawsuits may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against directors and officers. 

Our
Certificate of Incorporation provides that, unless otherwise consented to by us in writing, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
(or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, another State court in Delaware or the federal district court for the District
of Delaware) will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings: 

any derivative action or
 proceeding brought on behalf of us; 

any action asserting a
 claim of breach of a duty (including any fiduciary duty) owed by any of our current or former directors, officers, stockholders,
 employees or agents to us or our stockholders; 

any action asserting a
 claim against us or any of our current or former directors, officers, stockholders, employees or agents relating to any provision
 of the Delaware General Corporation Law DGCL or our Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws or as to which the
 DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; and 

any action asserting a
 claim against us or any of our current or former directors, officers, stockholders, employees or agents governed by the internal
 affairs doctrine of the State of Delaware, in each such case unless the Court of Chancery (or such other state or federal court located
 within the State of Delaware, as applicable) has dismissed a prior action by the same plaintiff asserting the same claims because
 such court lacked personal jurisdiction over an indispensable party named as a defendant therein. 

Our
Certificate of Incorporation will further provide that, unless otherwise consented to by us in writing to the selection of an alternative
forum, the federal district courts of the U.S. will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for the
resolution of any complaint against any person in connection with any offering of our securities, asserting a cause of action arising
under the Securities Act. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in our securities will be deemed to have
notice of and consented to this provision. 

Although
our Certificate of Incorporation contains the choice of forum provisions described above, it is possible that a court could rule that
such provisions are inapplicable for a particular claim or action or that such provisions are unenforceable. For example, under the Securities
Act, federal courts have concurrent jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act,
and investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. In addition, Section
27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the
Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder, and, therefore, the exclusive forum provisions described above do not apply to
any actions brought under the Exchange Act. 

82 

Although
we believe these provisions will benefit us by limiting costly and time-consuming litigation in multiple forums and by providing increased
consistency in the application of applicable law, these exclusive forum provisions may limit the ability of our shareholders to bring
a claim in a judicial forum that such shareholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees, which
may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. 

We
may be required to repurchase up to 6,720,000 shares of common stock from the investors with whom we entered into Forward Purchase Agreements
in connection with the closing of the Business Combination, which would reduce the amount of cash available to us to fund our growth
plan. 

On
and around July 13, 2023, FACT entered into separate Forward Purchase Agreements with certain investors (together, the FPA
Investors ), pursuant to which FACT (now Complete Solaria following the Closing) agreed to purchase in the aggregate, on the
date that is 24 months after the Closing Date (the Maturity Date ), up to 6,720,000 shares of common stock then held
by the FPA Investors (subject to certain conditions and purchase limits set forth in the Forward Purchase Agreements). Pursuant to the
terms of the Forward Purchase Agreements, each FPA Investor further agreed not to redeem any of the FACT Class A Ordinary Shares owned
by it at such time. The per price at which the FPA Investors have the right to sell the shares to us on the Maturity Date will not be
less than 5.00 per share. 

If
the FPA Investors hold some or all of the 6,720,000 forward purchase agreement shares on the Maturity Date, and the per share trading
price of our common stock is less than the per share price at which the FPA Investors have the right to sell the common stock to us on
the Maturity Date, we would expect that the FPA Investors will exercise this repurchase right with respect to such shares. In the event
that we are required to repurchase these forward purchase agreement shares, or in the event that the forward purchase agreements are
terminated the amount of cash arising from the Business Combination that would ultimately be available to fund our liquidity and capital
resource requirements would be reduced accordingly, which would adversely affect our ability to fund our growth plan in the manner we
had contemplated when entering into the forward purchase agreements. 

Warrants
to purchase shares of our common stock may not be exercised at all or may be exercised on a cashless basis and we may not receive any
cash proceeds from the exercise of such warrants. 

The
exercise price of warrants to purchase shares of our common stock may be higher than the prevailing market price of the underlying shares
of common stock. The exercise price of such warrants is subject to market conditions and may not be advantageous if the prevailing market
price of the underlying shares of common stock is lower than the exercise price. The cash proceeds associated with the exercise of such
warrants to purchase our common stock are contingent upon our stock price. The value of our common stock will fluctuate and may not align
with the exercise price of such warrants at any given time. If such warrants are out of the money, meaning the exercise
price is higher than the market price of our common stock, there is a high likelihood that warrant holders may choose not to exercise
their warrants. As a result, we may not receive any proceeds from the exercise of such warrants. 

Furthermore,
with regard to certain warrants to purchase shares of our common stock that were issued in a private placement at the time of FACT s
IPO and warrants issued to certain selling securityholders in connection with conversion of working capital loans, it is possible that
we may not receive cash upon their exercise, since these warrants may be exercised on a cashless basis. A cashless exercise allows warrant
holders to convert the warrants into shares of our common stock without the need for a cash payment. Instead of paying cash upon exercise,
the warrant holder would receive a reduced number of shares based on a predetermined formula. As a result, the number of shares issued
through a cashless exercise will be lower than if the warrants were exercised on a cash basis, which could impact the cash proceeds we
receive from the exercise of such warrants. 

83 

Servicing our debt requires a significant
amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt. 

Our ability to make scheduled
payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including 12 Notes and the 7 Notes (collectively,
the Convertible Senior Notes ), depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and
other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service
our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more
alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly
dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may
not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on
our debt obligations, including the Convertible Senior Notes. 

The conversion features of the Convertible
Senior Notes may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. 

The holders of Convertible
Senior Notes will be entitled to convert their notes at and during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to
convert their notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than
paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), at maturity we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion
obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. 

Certain provisions in the indentures governing
the Convertible Senior Notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us. 

Certain provisions in the
indentures governing the Convertible Senior Notes may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire us. For example,
the indentures governing the Convertible Senior Notes will require us to repurchase the Convertible Senior Notes for cash upon the occurrence
of a fundamental change and, in certain circumstances, to increase the conversion rate for a holder that converts its notes in connection
with a make-whole fundamental change. A takeover of us may trigger the requirement that we repurchase the Convertible Senior Notes and/or
increase the conversion rate, which could make it costlier for a potential acquirer to engage in such takeover. Such additional costs
may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of us that would otherwise be beneficial to investors. 

Conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes
may dilute the ownership interest of our stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock. 

The conversion of some or
all of the Convertible Senior Notes may dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders. Upon conversion of the Convertible Senior
Notes, we have the option to pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares
of our common stock. If we elect to settle our conversion obligation in shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares
of our common stock, any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing
market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Convertible Senior Notes may encourage short selling by market participants
because the conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the Convertible
Senior Notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock. 

The accounting method for the Convertible
Senior Notes could adversely affect our reported financial condition and results. 

The accounting method for
reflecting the Convertible Senior Notes on our balance sheet, accruing interest expense for the Convertible Senior Notes and reflecting
the underlying shares of our common stock in our reported diluted earnings per share may adversely affect our reported earnings and financial
condition. 

In August 2020, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASB published Accounting Standards Update ASU 2020-06 ASU 2020-06 ),
which simplified certain of the accounting standards that apply to convertible notes. ASU 2020-06 eliminated the cash conversion and beneficial
conversion feature modes used to separately account for embedded conversion features as a component of equity. Instead, an entity would
account for convertible debt or convertible preferred stock securities as a single unit of account, unless the conversion feature requires
bifurcation and recognition as derivatives. Additionally, the guidance requires entities to use the if-converted method
for all convertible instruments in the diluted earnings per share calculation and to include the effect of potential share settlement
for instruments that may be settled in cash or shares. ASU 2020-06 became effective for us beginning on January 1, 2022. 

In addition, we expect that
the shares of common stock underlying the Convertible Senior Notes will be reflected in our diluted earnings per share using the if
converted method, in accordance with ASU 2020-06. Under that method, diluted earnings per share would generally be calculated assuming
that all the Convertible Senior Notes were converted solely into shares of common stock at the beginning of the reporting period, unless
the result would be anti-dilutive. The application of the if-converted method may reduce our reported diluted earnings per share to the
extent we are profitable in the future, and accounting standards may change in the future in a manner that may adversely affect our diluted
earnings per share. 

Furthermore, if any of the
conditions to the convertibility of the Convertible Senior Notes is satisfied, then we may be required under applicable accounting standards
to reclassify the liability carrying value of the Convertible Senior Notes as a current, rather than a long-term, liability. This reclassification
