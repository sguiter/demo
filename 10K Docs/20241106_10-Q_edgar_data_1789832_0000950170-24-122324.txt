As a result, the total number of Class A and Class B Shares did not change. The Company retained control in the Partnership based on the delegation of control provisions, as described in Note 1, Basis of Presentation . As a result of the equity offering transactions described above, we recognized adjustments decreasing the carrying amount of the Class A shareholders capital balance by million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and increasing the carrying amount of noncontrolling interest by an equal amount to reflect the change in ownership interest. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 we recognized adjustments increasing the carrying amount of the Class A shareholders capital balance by million and decreasing the carrying amount of noncontrolling interest by an equal amount.

 Class B Units for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million. The repurchase transaction was consummated on September 11, 2024. The purchase price per Class B Unit was , the closing price of the Class A Shares on September 9, 2024. The repurchase transactions described above were funded using borrowings under the Partnership s existing revolving credit facility and cash on hand (see Note 6, Debt and Interest Expense ). Pursuant to the terms of the repurchase agreements described above, immediately following each purchase of the Class B Units from the Sponsors, the Partnership cancelled the repurchased units, and the Company cancelled, for no consideration, an equal number of its Class B Shares. The repurchase transactions were accounted for in accordance with ASC 810 whereby changes in a parent s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amounts of the noncontrolling interest were adjusted to reflect the changes in the ownership interest with the difference between the amounts of consideration paid and the amounts by which the noncontrolling interest were adjusted recognized as a reduction in equity attributable to Class A shareholders. Distributions to noncontrolling interest holders related to the 2024 repurchase transactions exceeded the noncontrolling interest s carrying value resulting in a deficit balance as shown in the accompanying consolidated statement of changes in partners capital (deficit). We incurred approximately million of costs directly attributable to the repurchase transactions that were charged to equity (nine months ended September 30, 2023: million). As a result of the equity offering and the unit repurchase transactions described above, we also recognized an additional deferred tax asset of million (nine months ended September 30, 2023: million) related to the change in the temporary difference between the carryi ng amount and the tax basis of our investment in the Partnership. The effect of recognizing the additional deferred tax asset was included in Class A shareholders equity balance in the accompanying consolidated statement of changes in partners capital (deficit) due to the transactions being characterized as transactions among or with shareholders.

If the Partnership obtains an investment grade credit rating, the pricing levels will be based on the Partnership s credit ratings in effect from time to time. As of September 30, 2024, borrowings of million were drawn and outstanding under the Partnership s revolving credit facility, and borrowings of million, excluding deferred issuance costs, were drawn and outstanding under the Partnership s Term Loan A facility. The Credit Facilities can be used for borrowings and letters of credit for general corporate purposes. The Credit Facilities are guaranteed by each direct and indirect wholly owned material domestic subsidiary of the Partnership, and are secured by

As of September 30, 2024, the Partnership was in compliance with these financial covenants. Fair Value Measurement At September 30, 2024, our total debt had a carrying value of million and had a fair value of approximately million, based on Level 2 inputs in the fair value measurement hierarchy. The carrying value of the amounts under the Term Loan A facility and revolving credit facility at September 30, 2024 , approximated their fair value. Any changes in interest rates do not impact cash outflows associated with fixed rate interest payments or settlement of debt principal, unless a debt instrument is repurchased prior to maturity.

Legal Proceedings In the ordinary course of business, the Company is from time to time party to various judicial and administrative proceedings. We regularly assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. In the case of a known contingency, we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. On or about March 14, 2023, the Company received a Notice of Violation (the Notice from the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality DEQ in connection with the produced water release described under Environmental Contingencies above. The Notice alerts the Company that it may have violated the State s water pollution control laws, but neither imposes nor waives any enforcement action. On January 11, 2024, the DEQ proposed an Administrative Consent Agreement ACA that included an administrative penalty of million and further line monitoring practices with respect to certain water gathering pipelines. The Company is evaluating the proposed ACA and is engaging in further discussions with the DEQ. Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that the outcome of known matters, including the produced water release described above, would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , we did t have material accrued liabilities for legal contingencies. 

 reportable segments: (1) gathering, (2) processing and storage and (3) terminaling and export. Our reportable segments comprise the structure used by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, who, collectively, have been determined to be our Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM to make key operating decisions and assess performance. These segments are strategic business units with differing products and services. Interest and Other includes certain functional departments that do not recognize revenues. Our CODM evaluates the segments operating performance based on Adjusted EBITDA, defined as net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), and depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted for other non-cash, non recurring items, if applicable. For all of the segments, the CODM uses segment Adjusted EBITDA in the annual budgeting and monthly forecasting process. The CODM considers budget-to-current forecast and prior forecast-to-current forecast variances for Adjusted EBITDA on a monthly basis for evaluating performance of each segment and making decisions about allocating capital and other resources to each segment.

 Item 2.	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited financial statements and accompanying footnotes included under Item 1. Financial Statements and in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes in our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (our 2023 Annual Report ). 
 Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise indicates, references in this report to Hess Midstream LP, the Company, us, our, we or similar terms refer to Hess Midstream LP, including its consolidated subsidiaries. References to Partnership refer to Hess Midstream Operations LP. 
 This discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 Overview 
 We are a fee-based, growth-oriented, limited partnership that owns, operates, develops and acquires a diverse set of midstream assets and provides fee-based services to Hess Corporation Hess and third-party customers. We are managed and controlled by Hess Midstream GP LLC, the general partner of our general partner that is owned 50/50 by Hess and GIP II Blue Holding, L.P. GIP and together with Hess, the Sponsors ). Our assets are primarily located in the Bakken and Three Forks shale plays in the Williston Basin area of North Dakota, which we collectively refer to as the Bakken. 
 On February 8, 2024, GIP sold an aggregate of 11,500,000 of our Class A Shares representing limited partner interests in the Company Class A Shares ), inclusive of the underwriter s option to purchase up to 1,500,000 of additional shares, which was fully exercised, in an underwritten public offering at a price to the underwriter of 32.83 per Class A Share. GIP received net proceeds from the offering of approximately 377.5 million. On May 31, 2024, GIP sold an aggregate of 10,000,000 of our Class A Shares in an underwritten public offering at a price to the underwriter of 34.025 per Class A Share. GIP also granted the underwriter an option to purchase up to an additional 1,500,000 Class A shares at the same price per Class A share, which was exercised in full on June 3, 2024. GIP received net proceeds from the offering of approximately 391.3 million. On September 20, 2024, GIP sold an aggregate of 12,650,000 of our Class A shares, inclusive of the underwriter s option to purchase up to 1,650,000 of additional shares, which was fully exercised, in an underwritten public offering at a price to the underwriter of 35.12 per Class A Share. GIP received net proceeds from the offering of approximately 444.3 million. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the offering transactions. The offering transactions were conducted pursuant to a registration rights agreement among us and the Sponsors. 
 On March 14, 2024, the Partnership purchased directly from the Sponsors 2,816,901 Class B units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership Class B Units for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 100 million. The purchase price per Class B Unit was 35.50, the closing price of the Class A shares on March 11, 2024. On June 26, 2024, the Partnership, purchased directly from the Sponsors 2,724,052 Class B Units for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 100.0 million. The purchase price per Class B Unit was 36.71, the closing price of the Class A Shares on June 24, 2024. On September 11, 2024, the Partnership, purchased directly from the Sponsors 2,823,262 Class B Units for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 100.0 million. The purchase price per Class B Unit was 35.42, the closing price of the Class A Shares on September 9, 2024. The repurchase transactions were funded using borrowings under the Partnership s existing revolving credit facility and cash on hand. 
 As a result of the equity offerings and unit repurchase transactions described above, our public ownership increased from approximately 29.8 at December 31, 2023, to approximately 47.3 at September 30, 2024, on a consolidated basis. 
 We utilized the excess free cash flow beyond our growing distributions to provide increased return of capital to our shareholders through an immediate increase in our quarterly distribution level per Class A Share in each of the first three quarters of 2024, which, on an annualized basis, is significantly above our target of at least 5 growth in annual distributions per Class A Share through 2026. 
 Our assets and operations are organized into the following three reportable segments: (1) gathering (2) processing and storage and (3) terminaling and export.

 Third Quarter Results 
 Significant financial and operating highlights for the third quarter of 2024 included: 
 Consolidated net income of 164.7 million; 

Net income attributable to Hess Midstream LP after deduction for noncontrolling interest of 58.6 million, or 0.63 basic earnings per Class A Share; 

Net cash provided by operating activities of 224.9 million; 

Adjusted EBITDA of 286.9 million; 

Cash distribution of 0.6846 per Class A Share declared on October 28, 2024, an increase of 0.0169 per Class A Share for the third quarter of 2024 as compared with the second quarter of 2024. 

Revenues and other income in the third quarter of 2024 were 378.5 million compared with 363.1 million in the prior year quarter. Third quarter 2024 revenues and other income were up 15.4 million compared with the prior-year quarter primarily due to higher physical volumes. Total operating costs and expenses in the third quarter of 2024 were 146.8 million, compared with 143.1 million in the prior-year quarter, primarily attributable to higher depreciation expense for additional assets placed in service. Interest expense, net of interest income, in the third quarter of 2024 was 51.8 million, up from 45.8 million in the prior-year quarter, primarily attributable to the new 600.0 million 6.500 fixed-rate senior unsecured notes issued in May 2024, partially offset by lower interest on lower borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Income tax expense increased 7.5 million resulting from ownership changes following secondary equity offering and Class B Unit repurchase transactions. As a result, consolidated net income decreased 0.1 million and Adjusted EBITDA increased 17.2 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared with the third quarter of 2023. 
 Throughput volumes increased 9 for gas gathering, crude oil gathering and gas processing in the third quarter of 2024 compared with the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to higher production and higher gas capture. Throughput volumes decreased 5 for terminaling in the third quarter of 2024 compared with the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to lower third-party volumes. Water gathering volumes increased 29 , reflecting higher crude oil production and increased utilization of our water gathering infrastructure.

PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONT D) Table of Contents 

 How We Generate Revenues 
 We generate substantially all of our revenues by charging fees for gathering, compressing and processing natural gas and fractionating NGLs; gathering, terminaling, loading and transporting crude oil and NGLs; storing and terminaling propane; and gathering and disposing of produced water. We have entered into long term, fee based commercial agreements with Hess effective January 1, 2014, for oil and gas services agreements, and effective January 1, 2019, for water services agreements. 
 Except for the water services agreements and except for a certain gathering sub-system, as described below, each of our commercial agreements with Hess had an initial 10-year term. We exercised our renewal options to extend each of these commercial agreements for one additional 10-year term Secondary Term effective January 1, 2024, through December 31, 2033. There were no changes to any provisions of the existing commercial agreements as a result of the exercise of the renewal options. For this gathering sub-system, the initial term is 15 years effective January 1, 2014, and the Secondary Term is 5 years. For the water services agreements the initial term is 14 years effective January 1, 2019, and the Secondary Term is 10 years. We have the sole option to renew these remaining agreements for their Secondary Term that is exercisable at a later date. Upon the expiration of the Secondary Term, if any, the agreements will automatically renew for subsequent one-year periods unless terminated by either party no later than 180 days prior to the end of the applicable Secondary Term. 
 These agreements include dedications covering substantially all of Hess existing and future owned or controlled production in the Bakken, minimum volume commitments, inflation escalators and fee recalculation mechanisms, all of which are intended to provide us with cash flow stability and growth, as well as downside risk protection. In particular, Hess minimum volume commitments under our commercial agreements provide minimum levels of cash flows and the fee recalculation mechanisms under the agreements allow fees to be adjusted annually to provide us with cash flow stability during the initial term of the agreements. During the Secondary Term of the agreements, the fee recalculation model is replaced by an inflation-based fee structure. See Note 3, Related Party Transactions for additional description of our commercial agreements. 
 Our revenues also include revenues from (i) third-party volumes contracted directly with us, (ii) third-party volumes contracted with Hess and delivered to us under the commercial agreements with Hess described above, and (iii) pass-through third-party rail transportation costs, third-party produced water trucking and disposal costs, electricity fees and certain other third-party fees, for which we recognize revenues in an amount equal to the costs. Together with Hess, we are pursuing strategic relationships with third-party producers and other midstream companies with operations in the Bakken in order to maximize our utilization rates.

PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONT D) Table of Contents 

 How We Evaluate Our Operations 
 Our management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our operating results and profitability. These metrics include (i) volumes, (ii) operating and maintenance expenses, and (iii) Adjusted EBITDA. 
 Volumes. The amount of revenues we generate primarily depends on the volumes of crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and produced water that we handle at our gathering, processing, terminaling, storage facilities and disposal facilities. These volumes are affected primarily by the supply of and demand for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs in the markets served directly or indirectly by our assets, including changes in crude oil prices, which may further affect volumes delivered by Hess. Although Hess has committed to minimum volumes under our commercial agreements described above, our results of operations will be impacted by our ability to: 
 utilize the remaining uncommitted capacity on, or add additional capacity to, our existing assets, and optimize our existing assets; 

identify and execute expansion projects, and capture incremental throughput volumes from Hess and third parties for these expanded facilities; 

increase throughput volumes at our Ramberg Terminal Facility, Tioga Rail Terminal and the Johnson s Corner Header System by interconnecting with new or existing third party gathering pipelines; and 

increase gas throughput volumes by interconnecting with new or existing third party gathering pipelines. 

Operating and Maintenance Expenses. Our management seeks to maximize the profitability of our operations by effectively managing operating and maintenance expenses. These expenses are comprised primarily of costs charged to us under our omnibus agreement and employee secondment agreement, third party contractor costs, utility costs, insurance premiums, third party service provider costs, related property taxes and other non income taxes and maintenance expenses, such as expenditures to repair, refurbish and replace storage facilities and to maintain equipment reliability, integrity and safety. These expenses generally remain relatively stable across broad ranges of throughput volumes but can fluctuate from period to period depending on the mix of activities performed during that period and the timing of substantial expenses, such as gas plant turnarounds. We seek to manage our maintenance expenditures by scheduling periodic maintenance on our assets in order to minimize significant variability in these expenditures and minimize their impact on our cash flow. 
 Adjusted EBITDA. We previously reported the non-GAAP measure of Adjusted EBITDA, which we defined as reported net income (loss) before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization and our proportional share of depreciation of our equity affiliates, as further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance, such as transaction costs, other income and other non-cash and non-recurring items, if applicable. As this definition varied from other definitions of Adjusted EBITDA, we determined it was appropriate to discontinue reporting Adjusted EBITDA as previously defined. Beginning with the second quarter of 2024, and as presented in this report, Adjusted EBITDA is defined as reported net income (loss) before net interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), and depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance, such as transaction costs, other income and other non cash and non recurring items, if applicable. Prior period calculations of Adjusted EBITDA have been recast to conform to the new presentation, as applicable. We use Adjusted EBITDA to analyze our performance and liquidity. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a non GAAP supplemental financial measure that management and external users of our consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, may use to assess: 
 our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded companies in the midstream energy industry, without regard to historical cost basis or financing methods; 

the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our shareholders; 

our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and 

the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities. 

21 

PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONT D) Table of Contents 

 We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA are net income (loss) and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, net cash provided by (used in) operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes some but not all items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Additionally, because Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility.

 Gathering 
 Revenues and other income increased 6.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, of which 7.8 million is attributable to higher gas gathering volumes that were above MVCs in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, 4.8 million is attributable to higher water gathering and disposal revenue, 1.6 million is attributable to services provided directly to third parties, 0.3 million is attributable to higher pass through revenue, and 0.2 million is attributable to higher crude oil gathering volumes that were above MVCs in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023. These revenue increases were partially offset by 8.7 million attributable to lower tariff rates. 
 Operating and maintenance expenses decreased 1.2 million, of which 3.5 million is attributable to lower costs related to the produced water release remediation reserve, partially offset by 1.9 million attributable to higher employee costs allocated to us under our omnibus and employee secondment agreements and 0.4 million attributable to all other costs. Depreciation expense increased 3.3 million due to new compressors and other new gathering assets brought into service.

 Processing and Storage 
 Revenues and other income increased 11.9 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, of which 5.5 million is attributable to higher gas processing volumes that were above MVCs in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, 3.7 million is attributable to higher tariff rates and 3.3 million is attributable to services provided directly to third parties. These revenue increases were partially offset by 0.6 million attributable to lower pass-through revenue. 
 Operating and maintenance expenses increased 3.6 million, of which 2.4 million is attributable to higher third-party processing fees and 1.5 million is attributable to higher maintenance activity, slightly offset by 0.3 million attributable to lower other costs. 
 Income from equity investments increased 1.7 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to higher volumes processed at the LM4 plant. 
 Terminaling and Export 
 Revenues and other income decreased 2.5 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, of which 2.0 million is attributable to lower tariff rates and 0.9 million is attributable to lower crude oil terminaling volumes that were above MVCs in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023. These revenue decreases were partially offset by 0.4 million attributable to other income and services provided directly to third parties. 
 Operating and maintenance expenses decreased 2.8 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily attributable to the rail car recertification program. 
 Interest and Other 
 Interest expense, net of interest income, increased 6.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, of which 9.8 million is attributable to the new 600.0 million 6.500 fixed-rate senior unsecured notes issued during the second quarter of 2024, partially offset by 3.2 million attributable to lower interest on lower borrowings under our revolving credit facility and 0.6 million higher interest income. Income tax expense increased 7.5 million in the same period driven by increased ownership of the Partnership by Hess Midstream LP following equity offering and unit repurchase transactions in 2023 and 2024.

Other Factors Expected to Significantly Affect Our Future Results 
 We currently generate substantially all of our revenues under fee based commercial agreements with Hess, including third parties contracted with affiliates of Hess. These contracts provide cash flow stability and minimize our direct exposure to commodity price fluctuations, since we generally do not own any of the crude oil, natural gas, or NGLs that we handle and do not engage in the trading of crude oil, natural gas, or NGLs. However, commodity price fluctuations indirectly influence our activities and results of operations over the long-term, since they can affect production rates and investments by Hess and third parties in the development of new crude oil and natural gas reserves. The markets for oil and natural gas are volatile and will likely continue to be volatile in the future. 
 The throughput volumes at our facilities depend primarily on the volumes of crude oil and natural gas produced by Hess and third parties in the Bakken, which, in turn, are ultimately dependent on Hess and third parties exploration and production margins. Exploration and production margins depend on the price of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs. These prices are volatile and influenced by numerous factors beyond our or our customers control, including the domestic and global supply of and demand for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs. Sustained periods of low prices for oil and natural gas could materially and adversely affect the quantities of oil and natural gas that Hess and third parties can economically produce. The commodities trading markets, as well as global and regional supply and demand factors, may also influence the selling prices of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs. To the extent our plans include revenues for volumes above currently established MVC levels, such revenues could decline to the MVC levels as a result of market volatility. Furthermore, our ability to execute our growth strategy in the Bakken, including attracting third-party volumes, will depend on crude oil and natural gas production in that area, which is also affected by the supply of and demand for crude oil and natural gas. 
 The majority of our systems entered the Secondary Term of our commercial agreements, which includes a fixed fee structure based on the average fees paid by Hess during 2021-2023 adjusted annually for inflation up to 3 a year. Such a fee structure may provide less downside risk protection in the future compared to the fee structure we had during the initial term of the commercial agreements. For our terminaling and water gathering systems, the rates will continue to be reset through our annual rate redetermination process through 2033. For all of our systems, MVCs will continue to provide downside risk protection through 2033. Generally, all of our volumes are expected to be above currently established MVC levels in 2024, 2025 and 2026.

 Capital Resources and Liquidity 
 We expect our ongoing sources of liquidity to include: 
 cash on hand; 

cash generated from operations; 

borrowings under our revolving credit facility; 

issuances of additional debt securities; and 

issuances of additional equity securities. 

We believe that cash generated from these sources will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements, our planned short term capital expenditures, debt service requirements, our quarterly cash distribution requirements, future internal growth projects or potential acquisitions. 
 Our partnership agreement requires that we distribute all of our available cash, as defined in the agreement, to our shareholders. On October 28, 2024, we declared a quarterly cash distribution of 0.6846 per Class A Share, to be paid on November 14, 2024 to shareholders of record on November 7, 2024. Simultaneously, the Partnership will make a distribution of 0.6846 per Class B Unit of the Partnership to the Sponsors. 
 Fixed Rate Senior Notes 
 On May 16, 2024 the Partnership issued 600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.500 fixed rate senior unsecured notes due 2029 to qualified institutional investors. Interest is payable semi annually on June 1 and December 1, commencing December 1, 2024. The Partnership used the proceeds to reduce indebtedness outstanding under the Partnership s revolving credit facility, with the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Partnership had: 
 400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.500 fixed rate senior unsecured notes due 2030 that were issued to qualified institutional investors. Interest is payable semi annually on April 15 and October 15. 

750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.250 fixed rate senior unsecured notes due 2030 that were issued to qualified institutional investors. Interest is payable semi annually on February 15 and August 15. 

600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.500 fixed rate senior unsecured notes due 2029 that were issued to qualified institutional investors. Interest is payable semi annually on June 1 and December 1. 

550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.125 fixed rate senior unsecured notes due 2028 that were issued to qualified institutional investors. Interest is payable semi annually on June 15 and December 15. 

800.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625 fixed rate senior unsecured notes due 2026 that were issued to qualified institutional investors. Interest is payable semi annually on February 15 and August 15. 

The notes described above are guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of the Partnership. Each of the indentures for the senior notes described above contains customary covenants that restrict our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to (i) declare or pay any dividend or make any other restricted payments; (ii) transfer or sell assets or subsidiary stock; (iii) incur additional debt; or (iv) make restricted investments, unless, at the time of and immediately after giving pro forma effect to such restricted payments and any related incurrence of indebtedness or other transactions, no default has occurred and is continuing or would occur as a consequence of such restricted payment and if the leverage ratio does not exceed 4.25 to 1.00. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all debt covenants under the indentures. 
 In addition, the covenants included in the indentures governing the senior notes contain provisions that allow the Company to satisfy the Partnership s reporting obligations under the indenture, as long as any such financial information of the Company contains information reasonably sufficient to identify the material differences, if any, between the financial information of the Company, on the one hand, and the Partnership and its subsidiaries on a stand-alone basis, on the other hand and the Company does not directly own capital stock of any person other than the Partnership and its subsidiaries, or material business operations that would not be consolidated with the financial results of the Partnership and its subsidiaries. The Company is a holding company and has no independent assets or operations. Other than the interest in the Partnership and the effect of federal and state income taxes that are recognized at the Company level, there are no material differences between the consolidated financial statements of the Partnership and the consolidated financial statements of the Company.

PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONT D) Table of Contents 

 Credit Facilities 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Partnership had 1.4 billion senior secured credit facilities (the Credit Facilities consisting of a 1.0 billion 5-year revolving credit facility and a 400.0 million 5 year Term Loan A facility. The Credit Facilities mature in July 2027. Facility fees accrue on the total capacity of the revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the 5-year Term Loan A facility generally bear interest at Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus the applicable margin ranging from 1.65 to 2.55 , while the applicable margin for the 5 year syndicated revolving credit facility ranges from 1.375 to 2.050 . Pricing levels for the facility fee and interest rate margins are based on the Partnership s ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facilities). If the Partnership obtains an investment grade credit rating, the pricing levels will be based on the Partnership s credit ratings in effect from time to time. As of September 30, 2024, borrowings of 30.0 million were drawn and outstanding under the Partnership s revolving credit facility, and borrowings of 390.0 million, excluding deferred issuance costs, were drawn and outstanding under the Partnership s Term Loan A facility. 
 The Credit Facilities can be used for borrowings and letters of credit for general corporate purposes. The Credit Facilities are guaranteed by each direct and indirect wholly owned material domestic subsidiary of the Partnership, and are secured by first priority perfected liens on substantially all of the presently owned and after-acquired assets of the Partnership and its direct and indirect wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries, including equity interests directly owned by such entities, subject to certain customary exclusions. The Credit Facilities contain representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that the Partnership considers to be customary for an agreement of this type, including a covenant that requires the Partnership to maintain a ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facilities) for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 5.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter (5.50 to 1.00 during the specified period following certain acquisitions) and, prior to the Partnership obtaining an investment grade credit rating, a ratio of secured debt to EBITDA for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 4.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with these financial covenants. 
 Cash Flows 
 Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities increased 63.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The change in operating cash flows resulted primarily from an increase in revenues and other income of 107.5 million, an increase in distributions received from equity investments of 4.0 million, partially offset by an increase in expenses, other than depreciation and other non-cash gains and losses of 47.0 million, and an increase in cash used by changes in working capital of 1.5 million. 
 Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities increased 51.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 driven by higher payments for additions to property, plant, and equipment primarily related to our compression capacity and related pipeline infrastructure expansion program. 
 Financing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities increased 7.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. In the first nine months of 2024, we received proceeds of 590.5 million, net of financing costs, from our issuance of 600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.500 fixed-rate senior unsecured notes, that we used to reduce indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. In the first nine months of 2024, we repaid 317.5 million of net borrowings under our Credit Facilities compared to 258.0 million net proceeds from borrowings under our Credit Facilities during the same period in 2023. In addition, in the first nine months of 2024, we paid higher distributions to shareholders and noncontrolling interests of 21.7 million and paid higher transaction costs of 0.6 million as compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 Our operations can be capital intensive, requiring investments to expand, upgrade, maintain or enhance existing operations and to meet environmental and operational regulations.

Capital expenditures in 2024 are primarily attributable to continued expansion of our compression capacity and gas capture capabilities and related pipeline infrastructure to meet Hess and third parties current and future production growth and gas capture targets. The activities focus on the construction of two new compressor stations and associated pipeline infrastructure, which are expected to be placed in service in 2025. Capital expenditures in 2023 were also attributable to continued expansion of our compression capacity and related pipeline infrastructure.

As and when made, we believe that our forward-looking statements are reasonable. However, given these risks and uncertainties, caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements since such statements speak only as of the date when made and there can be no assurance that such forward-looking statements will occur and actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement we make. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise. 
 Item 3.	Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices. We generally do not take ownership of the crude oil, natural gas or NGLs that we currently gather, process, terminal, store or transport for our customers. Because we generate substantially all of our revenues by charging fees under long-term commercial agreements with Hess with minimum volume commitments, Hess bears the risks associated with fluctuating commodity prices and we have minimal direct exposure to commodity prices. 
 In the normal course of our business, we are exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates. Our financial risk management activities may include transactions designed to reduce risk by reducing our exposure to interest rate movements. Interest rate swaps may be used to convert interest payments on certain long term debt. At September 30, 2024, we did not have in place any derivative instruments to hedge any exposure to changes in interest rates. 
 At September 30, 2024, our total debt had a carrying value of 3,489.8 million and a fair value of approximately 3,497.3 million, based on Level 2 inputs in the fair value measurement hierarchy. A 15 increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 86.2 million or 80.9 million, respectively. The carrying value of the amounts under our Term Loan A facility and revolving credit facility at the quarter-end approximated their fair value. Any changes in interest rates do not impact cash outflows associated with fixed rate interest payments or settlement of debt principal, unless a debt instrument is repurchased prior to maturity. Our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates has not materially changed from what we previously disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report.
