reportable segments: Timberlands, Wood Products and Real Estate. Management activities in the Timberlands segment include planting and harvesting trees and building and maintaining roads. The Timberlands segment also generates revenues from non-timber resources such as hunting leases, recreation permits and leases, mineral rights contracts and carbon sequestration. The Wood Products segment manufactures and sells lumber and plywood. The Real Estate segment includes the sale of land holdings deemed non-strategic or identified as having higher and better use alternatives, a master planned community development and a country club. Our Timberlands segment supplies our Wood Products segment with a portion of its wood fiber needs. These intersegment revenues are based on prevailing market prices and typically represent a sizable portion of the Timberlands segment s total revenues. Our other segments generally do not generate intersegment revenues. These intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The reportable segments follow the same accounting policies used for our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements , with the exception of the valuation of inventories, which are reported using the average cost method for purposes of reporting segment results.

Diluted weighted-average shares outstanding 

For stock-based awards, the dilutive effect is calculated using the treasury stock method. Under this method, the dilutive effect is computed as if the awards were exercised at the beginning of the period (or at time of issuance, if later) and assumes the related proceeds were used to repurchase common stock at the average market price during the period. Related proceeds include future compensation cost associated with the stock award. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were approx imately and stock- based awards, respectively, that were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share as they were anti-dilutive. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, there were approxim ately and s tock-based awards, respectively, that were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share as they were anti-dilutive. Anti-dilutive stock-based awards could be dilutive in future periods. Share Repurchase Program On August 31, 2022, our board of directors authorized management to repurchase up to million of our common stock with no set time limit for the repurchase (the 2022 Repurchase Program). Shares under the 2022 Repurchase Program may be repurchased in open market transactions, including pursuant to trading plans adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (a Trading Plan), or through privately negotiated transactions. The timing, manner, price and amount of repurchases will be determined according to, and subject to, the terms of a Trading Plan, and, subject to the terms of a Trading Plan, the 2022 Repurchase Program may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason. During the three and nine months e nded September 30, 2024, we repurchased and shares of our common stock, respectively, for total consideration of million and million, respectively, under the 2022 Repurchase Plan. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased and shares of our common stock, respectively, for total consideration of million and million, respectively, under the 2022 Repurchase Plan. At September 30, 2024, we had remaining authorization of million for future stock repurchases under the 2022 Repurchase Program. Transaction costs are not counted against authorized funds. We record share repurchases upon trade date as opposed to the settlement date. We record a liability to account for repurchases that have not been cash settled. We retire shares upon repurchase. Any excess repurchase price over par is recorded in accumulated deficit.

billion included million of term loans under our Second Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement (Amended Term Loan Agreement) with our primary lender. Approximately million of our outstanding long-term debt was classified as current at September 30, 2024 on our accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets , including a million revenue bond that matured in October and a million term loan that matures in August . Certain borrowings under the Amended Term Loan Agreement are at the one-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR )-indexed variable rates, plus an applicable margin between and . We have entered into SOFR-indexed interest rate swaps to fix the interest rate on these variable rate term loans. See Note: 6 Derivative Instruments for additional information. On November 1, 2024, we entered into a tenth amendment to the Amended Term Loan Agreement, which provided for a new term loan of million maturing on , a new term loan of million maturing on , and a new term loan of million maturing on (collectively, the New Term Loans). The proceeds of the New Term Loans were used to refinance a million term loan under the Amended Term Loan agreement that matured on , and to replenish cash used to repay the million revenue bond that matured in October . The New Term Loans bear interest at a rate equal to daily simple SOFR plus an applicable margin ranging between and per annum depending on their respective maturity date. The New Term Loans provide for a cost-of-capital reset at year five whereby the applicable margin may be reset at the sole discretion of the lender. In connection with the New Term Loans, we terminated million of our forward-starting interest rate swaps and transferred the value realized from their termination into three new daily simple SOFR-indexed interest rate swaps to fix the interest rates associated with the New Term Loans. See Note 6: Derivative Instruments for additional information. CREDIT AGREEMENT On May 18, 2023, we entered into a First Amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (Amended Credit Agreement). The Amended Credit Agreement provides for loans based on SOFR instead of the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, provides us the option to borrow based on a daily SOFR or term SOFR basis, and provides mechanics relating to the transition from the use of SOFR to a replacement benchmark rate upon the occurrence of certain transition events.

 million revolving line of credit that matures . As provided in the Amended Credit Agreement, borrowing capacity may be increased by up to an additional million. The r evolving line of credit also includes a sublimit of million for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a sublimit of million for swing line loans. Usage under either or both sub facilities reduces availability under the revolving line of credit. We may utilize borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement to, among other things, refinance existing indebtedness and provide funding for working capital requirements, capital projects, acquisitions and other general corporate expenditures. At September 30, 2024, there were borrowings under the revolving line of credit and appro ximately million of our revolving line of credit was utilized for outstanding letters of credit. 

million of SOFR-indexed term loan debt. These cash flow hedges convert variable rates ranging from one-month SOFR plus to , to fixed rates ranging from to before patronage credits from lenders. Additionally, at September 30, 2024, we had million of forward-starting interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges for expected future debt refinancings that require settlement on the stated maturity date. On October 22, 2024, we terminated million of the forward-starting interest rate swaps and transferred the value realized from their termination into three new interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in future cash flows on the New Term Loans. These new daily simple SOFR-indexed interest rate swaps effectively fixed the interest rates associated with the New Term Loans between and , before patronage credits from lenders, depending on the maturity date of the associated term loan. Following these transactions, we had one remaining forward-starting interest rate swap of million available to fix the interest rate on future debt refinancings. See Note 5: Debt for additional information. The gross fair values of derivative instruments at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were million and million, respectively, all of which were classified in Other assets, non-current on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets .

At September 30, 2024, the amount of net gains expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months is approximately million. However, this expected amount to be reclassified into earnings is subject to volatility as the ultimate amount recognized in earnings is based on the SOFR rates at the time of net swap cash payments.

The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis, based on third-party sources, on the expected cash flows of each derivative. The analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate forward curves. The fair value of our long-term debt is estimated based upon quoted market prices for similar debt issues or estimated based on average market prices for comparable debt when there is no quoted market price. The contract value of our company owned life insurance is based on the amount at which it could be redeemed and, accordingly, approximates fair value. We believe that our other financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, receivables and payables have net carrying values that approximate their fair values with only insignificant differences. This is primarily due to the short-term nature of these instruments.

 For a discussion of some of the factors that may affect our business, results and prospects and a nonexclusive listing of forward-looking statements, refer to Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information on page 1 and Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Investors should not interpret the disclosure of a risk to imply that the risk has not already materialized. Forward-looking statements contained in this report present our views only as of the date of this report. Except as required under applicable law, we do not intend to issue updates concerning any future revisions of our views to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this report. 
 Our Company 
 We are a leading timberland REIT with ownership and management of over 2.1 million acres of timberland. We also own six sawmills and an industrial grade plywood mill, a residential and commercial real estate development business and a rural timberland sales program. Our operations are organized into three business segments: Timberlands, Wood Products and Real Estate. Our Timberlands segment supplies our Wood Products segment with a portion of its wood fiber needs. These intersegment revenues are based on prevailing market prices and typically represent a sizable portion of the Timberlands segment s total revenues. Our other segments generally do not generate intersegment revenues. In the discussion of our consolidated results of operations, our revenues and expenses are reported after elimination of intersegment revenues and expenses. In the Business Segment Results discussion below, each segment s revenues and expenses, as applicable, are presented before elimination of intersegment revenues and expenses. 
 Our business segments have been and will continue to be influenced by a variety of factors, including tariffs, quotas and trade agreements, changes in timber prices and in harvest levels from our timberlands, competition, timberland valuations, demand for our non-strategic timberland for higher and better use purposes, lumber and plywood prices, weather conditions, disruptions or inefficiencies in our supply chain including the availability of transportation, the efficiency and level of capacity utilization of our Wood Products manufacturing operations, changes in our principal expenses such as log costs, inflation, asset dispositions or acquisitions, impact of pandemics (such as COVID-19 and its variants), fires at our Wood Products facilities or on our timberlands, other natural disasters, government regulation and enforcement actions, and other factors. 
 Additionally, governments and businesses across the globe are taking action on climate change and are making significant commitments towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net zero. Achieving these commitments will require governments and companies to take major steps to modify operations, invest in low-carbon activities and purchase offsets to reduce environmental impacts. We believe we are well positioned to provide products and services that entities may utilize to achieve these commitments through natural climate solutions, including forest carbon offsets, carbon capture and storage projects, selling or leasing timberlands to third parties for renewable energy projects such as for solar power generation facilities, selling pulpwood and sawmill residuals for green energy production, and other emerging technologies that allows wood fiber to be used in applications ranging from biofuels to bioplastics. 
 Non-GAAP Measures 
 To supplement our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we present certain non-GAAP measures on a consolidated basis, including Total Adjusted EBITDDA and Cash Available for Distribution (CAD), which are defined and further explained and reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in the Liquidity and Performance Measures section below. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered only as supplemental to, and are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our definitions of these non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly titled measures and may not be comparable to other similarly titled non-GAAP measures presented by other companies due to potential inconsistencies in methods of calculation. 
 See Note 2: Segment Information in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to the use of Adjusted EBITDDA for our segments. 
 Business and Economic Trends Affecting Our Operations 
 The operating results of our Timberlands, Wood Products and Real Estate business segments have been and will continue to be affected by the cyclical nature of the forest products industry. Log and pulpwood sales volumes in our Timberlands segment are typically lower in the first half of each year as winter rains in the Southern region and spring thaw in the Northern region limit timber harvesting operations due to softened roadbeds and wet logging conditions that restrict access to logging sites. The third quarter is typically our Timberlands segment's strongest production quarter. Demand for our manufactured wood products typically decreases in the winter months when construction activity is slower, while demand typically increases during the spring, summer and fall when construction activity is generally higher. 
 20 

Table of Contents 

 The demand for timber is directly affected by the underlying demand for lumber and other wood products, as well as by the demand for pulp, paper and packaging. Our Timberlands and Wood Products segments are impacted by both demand for new homes and home improvement and repair of existing homes in the United States. Our Timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. In general, our Idaho log market is typically in balance but can be tensioned from time to time, while Southern log markets generally have more available supply. 
 Rural real estate dispositions and acquisitions can also be adversely affected when access to any properties to be sold or considered for acquisition is limited due to adverse weather conditions. Development real estate sales occur throughout the year and depend on when our development of residential neighborhoods and commercial lots are substantially completed. The timing of these sales can also be impacted by contractor availability to complete the necessary infrastructure and other improvements. 
 Interest rates impact our business primarily through their effect on mortgage rates and the broader U.S. economy, and their influence on our capital allocation activities. According to economic data from Freddie Mac, between the end of 2011 and the end of 2021, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate, which is correlated with long-term interest rates, was below 4.0 before beginning to rise late in the first quarter of 2022, peaking at approximately 7.8 in October 2023, and ending 2023 at approximately 6.6 . The first half of 2024 continued to experience stubbornly high mortgage rates before easing modestly late in the third quarter of 2024 following the U.S. Federal Reserve's reduction of key benchmark interest rates by 50 basis points in September 2024. Inflation, which continues to slow, unemployment rates and the overall condition of the economy are factors that can influence the U.S. Federal Reserve s decision to adjust interest rates. 
 Single-family housing supply continues to remain well below the historical average as housing affordability remains a barrier to home ownership. In October 2024, the U.S. Census Bureau reported total housing starts during the third quarter of 2024 averaged over 1.3 million on a seasonally-adjusted annual basis, which was slightly lower than the second quarter of 2024. While single-family housing starts averaged approximately 963,000 units on a seasonally-adjusted annual basis during the third quarter of 2024, which was 4.1 lower than the second quarter of 2024, single-family housing starts on a seasonally-adjusted annual basis averaged just over 1.0 million units for August and September of 2024. Additionally, authorized building permits for single-family housing averaged nearly 960,000 units on a seasonally-adjusted annual basis during the third quarter of 2024, which was on par with the second quarter of 2024. 
 The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI) published in September 2024 reported that builders' confidence for newly built single-family homes was 41 that month, up from 37 in December 2023. This broke a string of four consecutive monthly declines. Even though there is increased builder confidence for new construction, builders continue to face several supply-side challenges, including a scarcity of buildable lots and skilled labor, along with higher material costs that continue to increase the cost of building homes. Overall, we continue to believe long-term underlying housing fundamentals remain favorable due to an undersupply of homes, lower than historical-average existing inventory for sale, and a large millennial demographic in their prime home-buying years. We believe these fundamentals will become more favorable if the Federal Reserve reduces its key benchmark interest rates, and those rate reductions have the effect of reducing mortgage rates. 
 The repair and remodel sector is the largest market segment for lumber demand. Near term headwinds on the repair and remodel market appear to have been driven by elevated interest rates, which raise the cost of discretionary projects, coupled with the low turnover of existing homes, which typically spurs repair and remodel activity. While spending in the sector for residential home remodeling has moderated, we believe future interest rate reductions along with long-term favorable underlying fundamentals, including solid household balance sheets, strong levels of home equity, an aging existing housing stock, and expected increases in sales of existing homes will stimulate repair and remodel demand for our products. 
 In our Timberlands segment, a significant portion of our Idaho sawlog prices are indexed on a one-month lag to lumber prices. The Northern region experienced a decline in sawlog prices during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily because of lower indexed lumber prices. In the Southern region, sawlog and pulpwood prices remained relatively stable. Our total harvest volume of over 1.9 million tons in the third quarter of 2024 was slightly lower than the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to decreased stumpage sales in the South. We expect to harvest between 1.8 and 1.9 million tons during the fourth quarter of 2024, with approximately 81 of the volume in the Southern region. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we completed the construction phase of the expansion and modernization of our Waldo, Arkansas sawmill (the Waldo Modernization Project). The Waldo Modernization Project included upgrades to the log yard and planer, a new saw line, and a new continuous dry kiln and is expected to increase the sawmill s annual capacity and reduce its operating costs significantly. The sawmill, which continued to operate during the construction, took limited downtime early in the third quarter to tie in the new equipment and restarted in mid-August 2024. We anticipate it will take between 6 and 12 months to reach the sawmill's expected new capacity of 275 million board feet per year. 
 In our Wood Products segment, lumber markets remained tepid during the third quarter of 2024, leading to continued pricing pressure. We shipped 267 million board feet of lumber during the third quarter of 2024 which was lower than the third quarter of 2023 primarily as a result of the planned downtime and restart at our Waldo, Arkansas sawmill during the third quarter of

 2024. We expect to ship between 275 and 285 million board feet of lumber during the fourth quarter of 2024, which takes into account the expected production ramp-up at the Waldo sawmill. 
 Our Real Estate segment benefited from increased rural real estate acres sold and increased residential lot sales in Chenal Valley during the third quarter of 2024. We expect to sell approximately 5,500 rural acres and 40 residential lots in Chenal Valley during the fourth quarter of 2024.

Third Quarter 2024 Compared with Third Quarter 2023 
 Revenues 
 Revenues were 255.1 million, a 10.4 million decrease compared with the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to lower lumber prices, lower lumber shipments as a result of the planned downtime and restart at our Waldo, Arkansas sawmill, and lower Northern sawlog prices. These decreases were partially offset by increased rural acres and residential lots sold, and a higher average price per residential lot in Chenal Valley due to a greater mix of premium lots sold during the third quarter of 2024. 
 Cost of goods sold 
 Cost of goods sold increased 1.3 million compared with the third quarter of 2023 mainly due to increased rural real estate acres and residential lots sold, and increased log and haul costs associated with higher harvest activity. These increases were partially offset by lower raw material, production, and shipping costs primarily at our Waldo, Arkansas sawmill due to its planned downtime early in the third quarter of 2024 and restart in mid-August following the completion of the construction phase of the expansion and modernization project. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 1.1 million compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to professional service fees, including costs for implementation of new systems, and employee-related costs. 
 Gain on fire damage 
 During the third quarter of 2023, we recognized insurance recoveries of 16.3 million for fire damage at our Ola, Arkansas sawmill. The claim with insurance carriers was finalized by the end of 2023. 
 22 

Table of Contents 

 Interest expense, net 
 Interest expense, net increased 1.7 million compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to less interest income earned on lower average cash and cash equivalents held in interest bearing accounts. 
 Income taxes 
 Income taxes are primarily due to income or loss from our PotlatchDeltic taxable REIT subsidiaries (TRS). For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded an income tax benefit of 4.1 million on TRS loss before tax of 15.6 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded income tax expense of 4.7 million on TRS income before tax of 18.4 million, which included the 16.3 million gain on fire damage. 
 Total Adjusted EBITDDA 
 Total Adjusted EBITDDA for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 10.4 million compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to lower lumber prices, lower lumber shipments, lower Northern sawlog prices and increased logging and hauling costs driven by increased harvest activity. The decrease in Total Adjusted EBITDDA was partially offset by increased rural acres and residential lots sold at a higher average price per residential lot in Chenal Valley. Refer to the Business Segment Results below for further discussions on activities for each of our segments. See Liquidity and Performance Measures for a reconciliation of Total Adjusted EBITDDA to net income (loss), the closest comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods presented. 
 Year to Date 2024 Compared with Year to Date 2023 
 Revenues 
 Revenues were 803.9 million, an increase of 34.4 million compared with the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to increased rural real estate acres sold, including the 34,100-acre rural timberland sale for 56.7 million in the second quarter of 2024, increased lumber shipments, increased Southern harvest volumes, and higher residential price per lot in Chenal Valley. These increases were partially offset by lower lumber prices and a decrease in Northern harvest volumes and sawlog prices. 
 Cost of goods sold 
 Cost of goods sold increased 56.5 million compared with the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to increased rural real estate acres sold. These increases were partially offset by lower logging and hauling costs primarily due to lower Northern harvest volume, which more than offset an increase in the South due to higher harvest volumes. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 6.8 million compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to employee-related costs and professional service fees, including costs for implementation of new systems. Additionally, the prior year included a 1.0 million reduction in stock compensation expense due to forfeiture of a former employee s stock awards. 
 Gain on fire damage 
 During the first nine months of 2023, we recognized insurance recoveries of 39.4 million for fire damage at our Ola, Arkansas sawmill. The claim with insurance carriers was finalized by the end of 2023. 
 Interest expense, net 
 Interest expense, net increased 2.3 million compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to less interest income earned on lower average cash and cash equivalents held in interest bearing accounts. 
 Income taxes 
 Income taxes are primarily due to income or loss from our PotlatchDeltic TRS. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded an income tax benefit of 12.9 million on TRS loss before tax of 51.1 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded income tax expense of 7.7 million on TRS income before tax of 33.8 million, which included the 39.4 million gain on fire damage. Income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 also included an approximate 1.0 million tax benefit from the reduction of our blended deferred tax rate during the second quarter of 2023.

Third Quarter 2024 Compared with Third Quarter 2023 
 Timberlands Adjusted EBITDDA for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 6.2 million compared with the third quarter of 2023 primarily as a result of the following: 
 Sales Price and Mix: Sawlog prices in the Northern region declined 14.7 to 110 per ton primarily due to the effect of lower indexed sawlog prices in Idaho. Southern sawlog prices remained relatively stable. 

Harvest Volume: Total Northern harvest volume increased 11.3 primarily due to more favorable operating conditions in the first quarter of 2023 allowing us to accelerate harvesting earlier in 2023 than in 2024. Total Southern harvest volume decreased approximately 5.8 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to fewer stumpage sales. 

Logging and Hauling Cost per Unit: Logging and hauling costs per delivered unit were lower primarily due to decreased fuel costs. 

Year to Date 2024 Compared with Year to Date 2023 
 Timberlands Adjusted EBITDDA for the first nine months of 2024 decreased 13.3 million compared with the first nine months of 2023 primarily as a result of the following: 
 Sales Price and Mix: Sawlog prices in the Northern region decreased 8.4 to 109 per ton primarily due to the effect of lower indexed sawlog prices in Idaho. Southern sawlog prices remained relatively stable. 

Harvest Volume: We harvested 4.6 million tons in the Southern region during the first nine months of 2024, which was 2.6 higher than the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to more favorable operating conditions during 2024 partially offset by fewer stumpage sales. In the Northern region, operating conditions were less favorable in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023, resulting in a 5.7 decrease in harvest volume. 

Logging and Hauling Cost per Unit: Logging and hauling costs per delivered unit were lower due to a lower mix of Northern harvest volume and decreased fuel costs.

Third Quarter 2024 Compared with Third Quarter 2023 
 Wood Products Adjusted EBITDDA for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 24.6 million compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily as a result of the following: 
 Lumber Price: Average lumber sales price decreased to 402 per MBF during the third quarter of 2024 from 481 per MBF during the third quarter of 2023. 

Manufacturing Costs Per Unit: Higher manufacturing costs per unit were primarily due an increase in labor costs from normal wage adjustments, and the impact from downtime and the restart of our Waldo, Arkansas sawmill for the expansion and modernization project. 

Log Costs Per Unit: Log costs per unit were lower primarily as a result of lower log costs at our Idaho sawmill due to lower sawlog prices which are largely indexed to the price of lumber. 

Residual Sales, Panels and Other: A decrease in selling, general and administrative expense primarily due to lower variable employee-related costs more than offset lower residual sales compared to the third quarter of 2023.

 Third Quarter 2024 Compared with Third Quarter 2023 
 Real Estate Adjusted EBITDDA for the third quarter of 2024 was 31.9 million, an increase of 17.7 million compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily as a result of the following: 
 Rural Sales: There were more rural real estate acres sold in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. Rural real estate sales in the third quarter of 2024 included a 1,200-acre sale in Idaho for approximately 3,400 per acre. Rural real estate sales can vary quarter-to-quarter with the average price per acre fluctuating based on both the geographic area of the real estate and product mix. 

Development Sales: During the third quarter of 2024, we sold 53 residential lots at an average lot price of 204,851 compared to 32 lots at an average lot price of 89,122 during the third quarter of 2023. The increase in average lot price was primarily due to a higher mix of premium residential lot closings in the third quarter of 2024. The average price per residential lot fluctuates based on a variety of factors including size, location, and planned end use within the developments. We had no commercial lot sales in Chenal Valley during the third quarter of 2024 compared to one sale for 1.4 million, or 972,222 per acre, during the third quarter of 2023. 

Year to Date 2024 Compared with Year to Date 2023 
 Real Estate Adjusted EBITDDA for the first nine months of 2024 increased 81.8 million compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily as a result of the following: 
 Rural Sales: Rural real estate sales in the first nine months of 2024 included a 34,100-acre sale of four-year average age Southern timberlands to FIA for 56.7 million, a 2,000-acre conservation sale in Arkansas, and a 1,200-acre sale in Idaho. The first nine months of 2023 included a 2,240-acre conservation sale in Alabama and a 2,700-acre sale in Georgia. 

Development Sales: During the first nine months of 2024, we sold 90 residential lots at an average lot price of 168,850 compared to 98 lots at an average lot price of 103,526 during the first nine months of 2023. In addition, we sold 12 acres of commercial land in Chenal Valley for an average price of 492,746 per acre during the first nine months of 2024 compared to 7 acres of commercial land for an average price of 848,828 per acre during the first nine months of 2023. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Cash generated by our operations is highly dependent on the selling prices and volumes of our products and can vary from period to period. Changes in significant sources and uses of cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are presented by category as follows:

Net Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 Net cash from operating activities increased 25.8 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily as a result of the following: 
 Cash received from customers increased 34.6 million primarily due to increased rural real estate acres sold, including the 34,100-acre sale to FIA, higher average lot prices in Chenal Valley, and higher Southern harvest volumes. These increases were partially offset by lower lumber and Northern sawlog prices, and lower Northern harvest volumes. 

Cash payments decreased 13.5 million primarily due to lower Northern logging and hauling costs, and lower employee incentive compensation payouts. These declines were partially offset by costs associated with higher Southern harvest volumes. 

During the first nine months of 2024, we received the final 1.7 million of insurance proceeds related to business interruption insurance following the fire at our Ola, Arkansas sawmill in June 2021 compared to 21.8 million received during the first nine months of 2023. 

28 

Table of Contents 

 Cash paid for interest, net increased by approximately 6.9 million primarily due to lower interest income earned as a result of lower average cash balances in interest bearing accounts partially offset by increased patronage dividends from our lenders. Additionally, cash from operating activities for first nine months of 2024 includes reclassification of 22.5 million received from interest rate swaps that contain an other-than-insignificant financing element at inception as investing 20.9 million) and financing 1.6 million) activities. Cash from operating activities for first nine months of 2023 includes reclassification of 18.7 million received from interest rate swaps that contain an other-than-insignificant financing element at inception as investing 17.3 million) and financing 1.4 million) activities. 

Cash contributions to our pension and other postretirement employee benefit plans increased 5.1 million, primarily due to a 4.0 million contribution to our qualified pension plan. 

Net tax payments decreased 13.0 million due to lower taxable income generated from our TRS operations in 2024. 

Net Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Changes in cash flows from investing activities were primarily a result of the following: 
 Cash expenditures for property, plant and equipment, timberlands reforestation and road construction projects during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 were 71.5 million and 45.1 million, respectively, which includes capital expenditures for the Waldo, Arkansas sawmill expansion and modernization project of 38.0 million and 14.8 million, respectively. 

Cash expenditures for timberland acquisitions during the first nine months of 2024 was approximately 32.3 million which included the acquisition of 16,000 acres of mature timberlands in Arkansas. Cash expenditures for timberland acquisitions during the first nine months of 2023 was 1.7 million. 

We received 20.9 million during the first nine months of 2024 compared to 17.3 million during the first nine months of 2023 from certain interest rate swaps that contained an other-than-insignificant financing element at inception, which are required to be classified in investing activities. Cash flows from these above-market interest rate swaps reduce our interest costs on the corresponding variable rate debt. 

Net Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Changes in cash flows from financing activities were primarily a result of the following: 
 During the first nine months of 2024, we repurchased 666,472 shares of our common stock totaling 27.4 million, compared to the first nine months of 2023 where we repurchased 291,749 shares of our common stock totaling 13.1 million, including 1.7 million of repurchases that were not settled in cash until the fourth quarter of 2023. 

Dividend payments of 106.9 million during the first nine months of 2024 compared to 107.9 million during the first nine months of 2023 due to fewer shares outstanding following share repurchases. 

Future Sources and Uses of Cash 
 At September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 161.1 million. We expect cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash generated from our operating activities, and available borrowing capacity under our Credit Agreement, if needed, to be adequate to meet our future cash requirements. At September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes in our cash commitments arising in the normal course of business under our known contractual and other obligations as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. See Term Loans, Credit Agreement and Interest Rate Swap Agreements below for more information on significant sources and uses of cash subsequent to September 30, 2024. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 We invest cash in maintenance and discretionary capital expenditures at our Wood Products facilities. We also invest cash in the reforestation of timberlands and construction of roads in our Timberlands operations and to develop land in our Real Estate development operations. We evaluate discretionary capital improvements based on an expected level of return on investment. We expect to spend a total of approximately 100 million to 110 million for capital expenditures during 2024, including capital expenditures for the Waldo Modernization Project. 
 29 

Table of Contents 

 The Waldo Modernization Project includes upgrades to the log yard and planer, a new saw line, a new continuous dry kiln and other improvements which are expected to increase the sawmill s annual capacity from 190 million board feet of dimensional lumber to approximately 275 million board feet. The existing sawmill continued to operate before taking limited downtime to tie in the new equipment in July 2024. Following the restart of the sawmill in mid-August 2024, we anticipate it will take between 6 and 12 months to reach the sawmill's expected new capacity of 275 million board feet per year. We expect to spend approximately 131.0 million on the modernization project, of which a total of 124.4 million has been spent through September 30, 2024, and the remaining 6.6 million is expected to be spent during the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 On August 31, 2022, our board of directors authorized management to repurchase up to 200.0 million of our common stock with no set time limit for the repurchase (the 2022 Repurchase Program). Shares under the 2022 Repurchase Program may be repurchased in open market transactions, including pursuant to trading plans adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (a Trading Plan), or through privately negotiated transactions. At September 30, 2024, we had remaining authorization of 97.6 million for future stock repurchases under the 2022 Repurchase Program. The timing, manner, price and amount of repurchases will be determined according to a Trading Plan, and, subject to the terms of a Trading Plan, the Repurchase Program may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason. 
 Term Loans, Credit Agreement, and Interest Rate Swap Agreements 
 At September 30, 2024, our total outstanding principal on our long-term debt of 1.0 billion included 971.0 million of term loans under our Second Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement (Amended Term Loan Agreement) with our primary lender. Approximately 165.7 million of our outstanding long-term debt was classified as current at September 30, 2024 on our accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets , including a 65.7 million revenue bond that matured in October 2024 and a 100.0 million term loan that matures in August 2025. Certain borrowings under the Amended Term Loan Agreement are at the one-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)-indexed variable rates, plus a spread between 1.61 and 2.30 . We have entered into SOFR-indexed interest rate swaps to fix the interest rate on these variable rate term loans. 
 On November 1, 2024, we entered into a tenth amendment to the Amended Term Loan Agreement, which provided for three new term loans totaling 176.0 million that mature on November 1, 2032, 2033, and 2034, respectively (collectively referred to as the New Term Loans). The proceeds of the New Term Loans were used to refinance a 110.0 million term loan that matured on November 1, 2024 and to replenish cash used to repay the 65.7 million revenue bond that matured in October 2024. The New Term Loans bear interest at a rate equal to daily simple SOFR plus an applicable margin ranging between 2.20 and 2.30 per annum depending on the term loan's maturity date. The New Term Loans provide for a cost-of-capital reset at year five whereby the applicable margin may be reset at the sole discretion of the lender. As a result of the tenth amendment to the Amended Term Loan Agreement, at November 1, 2024, we had approximately 1.0 billion drawn under the agreement with our primary lender. 
 In connection with the refinancing, we terminated 125.0 million of our 200.0 million forward-starting interest rate swaps and transferred the value realized from their termination into three new interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in future cash flows on the New Term Loans. These three new daily simple SOFR-indexed interest rate swaps effectively fix the interest rates on the New Term Loans between 4.02 and 4.28 , before patronage credits from lenders, depending on the maturity date of the associated term loan. Following these transactions, we had one remaining forward-starting interest rate swap of 75.0 million available to fix the interest rate on future debt refinancings. 
 We have a 300.0 million revolving line of credit with a syndicate of lenders, that matures February 14, 2027 (Amended Credit Agreement). Under the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement, the amount of available principal may be increased up to an additional 500.0 million. We may also utilize borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement to, among other things, refinance existing indebtedness and provide funding for working capital requirements, capital projects, acquisitions, and other general corporate expenditures. At September 30, 2024, there were no borrowings under the revolving line of credit and approximately 0.6 million of the credit facility was utilized by outstanding letters of credit. 
 See Note 5: Debt and Note 6: Derivative Instruments in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our debt, credit, and interest rate swap agreements. 
 Financial Covenants 
 The Amended Term Loan Agreement and Amended Credit Agreement (collectively referred to as the Financing Agreements) contain certain covenants that limit our ability and that of our subsidiaries to create liens, merge or consolidate, dispose of assets, incur indebtedness and guarantees, repurchase or redeem capital stock and indebtedness, make certain investments or acquisitions, enter into certain transactions with affiliates or change the nature of our business. The Financing Agreements also contain financial maintenance covenants including the maintenance of a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio as defined in the Financing Agreements. We are permitted to pay dividends to our stockholders under the terms of the Financing Agreements so long as we expect to remain in compliance with the financial maintenance covenants.

Liquidity and Performance Measures 
 The discussion below is presented to enhance the reader s understanding of our operating performance, ability to generate cash and satisfy rating agency and creditor requirements. This information includes two measures: Total Adjusted EBITDDA and Cash Available for Distribution (CAD). These measures are not defined by GAAP and the discussion of Total Adjusted EBITDDA and CAD is not intended to conflict with or change any of the GAAP disclosures described herein. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered only as supplemental to, and are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to other similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies due to potential inconsistencies in methods of calculation.

Table of Contents 

 Total Adjusted EBITDDA is a non-GAAP measure that management uses in evaluating performance and to allocate resources between segments. Total Adjusted EBITDDA removes the impact of specific items that management believes do not directly reflect the core business operations on an ongoing basis. Management believes that this non-GAAP measure, when read in conjunction with our GAAP financial statements, provides useful information to investors and other interested parties by facilitating the comparability of our ongoing operating results over the periods presented and the identification of trends in our underlying business. It also can be used to evaluate the operational performance of the assets under management and to compare our operating results against analyst financial models and against the operating results of other public companies that supplement their GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures. 
 We define EBITDDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, net, income taxes, basis of real estate sold, depreciation, depletion and amortization. Adjusted EBITDDA further excludes certain specific items that are considered to hinder comparison of the performance of our businesses either year-on-year or with other businesses. 
 We reconcile Total Adjusted EBITDDA to net income (loss) for the consolidated company as it is the most comparable GAAP measure. 
 The following table provides a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Total Adjusted EBITDDA for the respective periods:

We define CAD as cash from operating activities adjusted for capital spending for purchases of property, plant and equipment, timberlands reforestation and roads and timberland acquisitions not classified as strategic. Management believes CAD is a useful indicator of the company s overall liquidity, as it provides a measure of cash generated that is available for dividends to common stockholders (an important factor in maintaining our REIT status), repurchase of the company s common shares, debt repayment, acquisitions and other discretionary and nondiscretionary activities. Our definition of CAD is limited in that it does not solely represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures since the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations. Therefore, we believe it is important to view CAD as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows . Our definition of CAD may be different from similarly titled measures reported by other companies, including those in our industry. CAD is not necessarily indicative of the CAD that may be generated in future periods.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 There have been no significant changes during 2024 to our critical accounting policies or estimates as presented in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Our market risk exposure on financial instruments includes interest rate risk on our bank credit facility, term loans and interest rate swap agreements and forward starting interest rate swap agreements. We are exposed to interest rate volatility on existing variable rate debt instruments and future incurrences of fixed or variable rate debt, which exposure primarily relates to movements in various interest rates. We use interest rate swaps and forward starting swaps to hedge our exposure to the impact of interest rate changes on existing debt and future debt issuances, respectively. All market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than for trading purposes. 
 For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk , of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our exposures to market risk have not changed materially since December 31, 2023. 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We conducted an evaluation (pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act)), under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. These disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports that are filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that this information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.

 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we implemented new enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems which replaced certain legacy systems in which a significant portion of our business transactions originated, were processed, or were recorded. As a result, we have made corresponding changes to our business processes and information systems, updating applicable internal controls over financial reporting where necessary. Our new ERP systems are intended to provide us with enhanced transactional processing, security and management tools and are intended to enhance internal controls over financial reporting. 
 There have been no other changes that occurred in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as defined in the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Shares under the 2022 Repurchase Program may be repurchased in open market transactions, including pursuant to a trading plan adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), or through privately negotiated transactions.
