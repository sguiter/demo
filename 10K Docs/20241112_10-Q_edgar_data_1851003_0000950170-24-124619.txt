CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), which statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. All statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are not statements of historical fact, including statements about our beliefs and expectations and regarding future events or our future results of operations, financial condition, business, strategies, financial needs, and the plans and objectives of management, are forward-looking statements and should be evaluated as such. These statements often include words such as anticipate, expect, suggests, plan, believe, intend, estimates, targets, projects, should, could, would, may, will, forecast and other similar expressions or the negative of those terms. We base these forward-looking statements on our current expectations, plans and assumptions that we have made in light of our experience in the industry, as well as our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances at such time. As you read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should understand that these statements are not guarantees of future performance or results. The forward-looking statements are subject to and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Although we believe that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions at the time they are made, you should be aware that many factors could affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. The following important factors, along with the factors discussed in Risk Factors in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 2023 Annual Report ), may materially affect such forward-looking statements: 
 Our success and revenue growth depends on our ability to add and retain scaled customers and convert our scaled customers into super-scaled customers; 

We often have long sales cycles, which can result in significant time between initial contact with a potential customer and execution of a customer agreement, making it difficult to project when, if at all, we will generate revenue from those customers; 

We may experience fluctuations in our operating results, which could make our future operating results difficult to predict; 

If we do not manage our growth effectively, the quality of our platform and solutions may suffer, and our business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected; 

Our industry is intensely competitive, and if we do not effectively compete against current and future competitors or fail to innovate and make the right investment decisions in our product offerings and platform, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed; 

Acquisitions or strategic investments could be difficult to identify and integrate (including the integration of our recent acquisition of LiveIntent, Inc.), divert the attention of management and disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition; 

The technology industry is subject to increasing scrutiny that could result in U.S. federal or state government actions that could negatively affect our business; 

Our business and the effectiveness of our platform depends on our ability to collect and use data online; 

New consumer tools, regulatory restrictions and potential changes to web browsers and mobile operating systems all threaten our ability to collect such data, which could harm our operating results and financial condition and adversely affect the demand for our products and solutions; 

Actual or perceived failures to comply with applicable data protection, privacy and security laws, regulations, standards and other requirements could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition; 

Any unfavorable publicity or negative public perception of current data collection practices could result in additional regulations which may impact the effectiveness of our data cloud and platform; 

A significant inadvertent disclosure or breach of confidential and/or personal information we process, or a security breach of our or our customers , suppliers or other partners IT Systems could be detrimental to our business, reputation, financial performance and results of operations; 

We depend on third-party data centers, systems and technologies to operate our business, the disruption of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition; 

If we fail to detect or prevent fraud or malware intrusion on our platform, devices, or systems, or into the systems or devices of our customers and their consumers, publishers could lose confidence in our platform, and we could 

1 

face legal claims and regulatory investigations, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition; 

The standards that private entities and inbox service providers adopt in the future to regulate the use and delivery of email may interfere with the effectiveness of our platform and our ability to conduct business; 

Any actual or perceived failure to comply with evolving regulatory frameworks around the development and use of artificial intelligence could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition; 

Catastrophic events such as pandemics, earthquakes, flooding, droughts, fire and power outages, and business and operational interruption by man-made problems such as war, conflicts and acts of terrorism; and 

Other factors discussed in other sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the section titled Risk Factors and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

You should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements and you should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The results, events, and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur, and actual results, events, or circumstances could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should not be construed by you to be exhaustive and speak only as of the date of this report. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this report to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law. If we update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements.

On February 3, 2021, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the Existing Credit Agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions and institutional lenders, providing for a senior secured credit facility (the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facility ), which consisted of (i) a initial revolving facility, (ii) a term loan facility, and (iii) a incremental revolving facility commitment. On March 22, 2023, the Company entered into a incremental revolving facility commitment pursuant to an amendment to the Existing Credit Agreement, thereby increasing the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facility to . On August 30, 2024, the Company refinanced and replaced the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facility by entering into a new credit agreement (the Credit Agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions and institutional lenders, providing for a five-year senior secured credit facility (the Senior Secured Credit Facility ), which consists of (i) a senior secured term A loan in an aggregate principal amount of (the Term Loan and (ii) a senior secured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Facility ). Concurrently with entering into the Credit Agreement, the Company drew down the Term Loan and repaid all outstanding obligations in the amount of under the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facility and terminated all commitments thereunder. The Senior Secured Credit Facility is fully secured by the financial institutions with a first lien on the Company s assets. The extensions of credit may be used solely (a) to refinance existing indebtedness, (b) to pay any expenses associated with this line of credit agreement, (c) for acquisitions, and (d) for other general corporate purposes. The Company is required to repay the principal balance and any unpaid accrued interest on the Senior Secured Credit Facility on August 30, 2029.

The effective interest rate of the facility was for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company accounted for the refinancing in accordance with ASC 470, Debt, as a modification of existing debt, and accordingly the debt issuance cost of incurred on the Senior Secured Credit Facility along with the of remaining deferred financing costs of the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facility were capitalized and were recognized as a reduction in long-term

(b) 	 Other contingencies The Company is a party to various litigations and administrative proceedings related to claims arising from its operations in the ordinary course of business, including in relation to certain acquisition related liabilities (Refer to "Note 6. Acquisition Related Liabilities"). The Company records provisions for losses when claims become probable and the amounts are estimable. Although the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company s management believes that the resolution of the matters will not have a material impact on the Company s business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.

Upon a change in control, restricted stock and restricted stock units vest as to of the shares with the balance of the shares vesting in equal quarterly installments following the change in control over the remainder of a term from the original date of grant. The restricted stock and restricted stock units fully vest upon a change in control to the extent five years has passed from the original date of grant of the restricted stock or restricted stock units. Since the vesting of these awards was contingent upon the change of control event, which was not considered probable until it occurred, the Company did not record any stock-based compensation for such awards prior to the IPO, a change in control event. The stock-based compensation has been recognized following the vesting of restricted stock, restricted stock units and options as described below. The Company ceased granting awards under the Plans following its adoption of the 2021 Plan (as defined below) in connection with the IPO. In connection with the IPO, the Company adopted the Zeta Global Holdings Corp. 2021 Incentive Award Plan (the 2021 Plan ), which was effective as of the day prior to the first public trading date of the Company's Class A common stock and under which restricted stock, restricted stock units and options have been granted to service providers. With certain exceptions, the equity awards granted under the 2021 Plan generally vest over , with of the shares vesting upon the first anniversary of the grant date and the remainder of the shares vesting in equal quarterly installments thereafter. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of and , respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of and , respectively. Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units As noted above, the Company s restricted stock and restricted stock units granted prior to the IPO did not vest until a change of control. On March 24, 2021, the Company s board of directors approved a modification in the vesting terms of its restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards. This modification was accounted for under the guidance in ASC 718-20-35-3. Given the vesting of the modified awards contained a performance condition associated with the IPO, the Company had determined that the modification was considered improbable-to-improbable under ASC 718-20-55-118 through 119. The Company recognized compensation expense over the modified vesting terms, based on the fair value as of the date of modification. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company's board of directors approved the modification of the vesting schedule of certain awards granted prior to the IPO to accelerate the vesting of those grants. These modifications were accounted for in accordance with ASC 718-20-35-3 and did not have any material impact on the stock-based compensation during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. There were no such modifications during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Performance Stock Unit PSU Award On April 3, 2024, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved the grant of target PSUs under the 2021 Plan (the 2024 PSUs ). Upon achievement of certain conditions described below, the 2024 PSUs could result in the issuance of up to shares of Class A common stock. The 2024 PSUs are earned on the determination date, which is after the end of each fiscal quarter beginning with the three-month period ending on December 31, 2024 and ending with, and including, the three-month period ending on December 31, 2028. The Company expects to make the first determination in January 2025 as to the number of 2024 PSUs earned, if any, with respect to the three-month period ending on December 31, 2024. The 2024 PSUs shall be earned as a percentage of the 2024 PSUs granted, based on the 20-day volume-weighted average closing price per share VWAP for such quarter. In no event shall (i) any 2024 PSUs be earned if the VWAP for the applicable quarter is below and (ii) more than of the target 2024 PSUs be earned if the VWAP is at or above . The number of 2024 PSUs earned for such quarter shall be reduced by the number of 2024 PSUs, if any, earned in any prior quarter. Each 2024 PSU represents the right to receive shares of Class A common stock as set forth in the 2024 PSU grant agreement or, at the option of the Company, an equivalent amount of cash. Participants have no right to the distribution of any shares or payment of any cash until the time the 2024 PSUs are earned and have vested. Each 2024 PSU provides for the right to receive a dividend equivalent to the value of any ordinary cash dividends paid on substantially all the outstanding shares of Class A common stock if the 2024 PSUs are earned and vested. Earned 2024 PSUs vest as to on the date the Company determines the number of 2024 PSUs that are earned for such quarter, and the remaining earned 2024 PSUs vest in equal quarterly installments ending on the second anniversary of such determination date, subject to accelerated vesting in connection with certain qualifying terminations of employment or a change in control.

The 2021 ESPP permits participants to purchase the Company s Class A common stock through contributions up to a specified percentage of their eligible compensation. The maximum number of shares that may be purchased by a participant during any offering period is capped at . In addition, no employee will be permitted to accrue the right to purchase shares under the Section 423 component at a rate in excess of worth of shares during any calendar year during which such a purchase right is outstanding (based on the fair market value per share of the Company's Class A common stock as of the first day of the offering period). The 2021 ESPP has consecutive offering periods of approximately six months in length commencing each year on December 1 and June 1 and ending on each May 31 and November 30, as applicable. The Company determined the estimated fair value of the shares purchased under the 2021 ESPP using the Black-Scholes-Merton method. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued shares of Class A common stock related to the ESPP offering that ended on May 31, 2024.

 Key Performance Metrics 
 We review key performance metrics, discussed below, to evaluate our business, track performance, identify trends, formulate plans and make strategic decisions. We believe that the presentation of such metrics provides investors with effective ways to measure and model the performance of companies such as ours, with recurring revenue streams. 
 Scaled customers increased 8 to 475 as of September 30, 2024 compared to 440 as of September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher usage of platform among our customers and new additions to our scaled customer base. Of our scaled customers, 144 and 124 were super-scaled customers as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Scaled customer ARPU increased 33 to 557,231 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 418,373 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher usage of our platform among scaled customers. 
 22 

ARPU for our super-scaled customers increased 30 to 1.6 million (across 144 customers) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.2 million (across 124 customers) for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Description of Certain Components of Financial Data 
 Revenues 
 Our revenue primarily arises from use of our technology platform via subscription fees, volume-based utilization fees and fees for professional services. Our platform revenue is comprised of a mix of direct platform revenue and integrated platform revenue, which leverages API integrations with third parties. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we derived 68 and 72 of our revenues from direct platforms, respectively, and 32 and 28 of our revenues from integrated platforms, respectively. Revenues are recognized when control of these services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services. Sales and other taxes collected by us are excluded from revenue. Our revenue recognition policies are discussed in more detail below under Critical Accounting Estimates. 
 Cost of revenues (excluding depreciation and amortization) 
 Cost of revenue excludes depreciation and amortization and consists primarily of media and marketing costs and certain employee-related costs. Media and marketing costs consist primarily of fees paid to third-party publishers, media owners or managers, and strategic partners that are directly related to revenue-generating events. We pay these third-party publishers, media owners or managers and strategic partners on revenue-share, a cost-per-lead, cost-per-click, or cost-per-thousand-impressions basis. Expenses related to internet traffic associated with the viewing of available impressions or queries per second and costs of providing support to our customers are also included in the cost of revenues (excluding depreciation and amortization). Employee-related costs included in cost of revenues (excluding depreciation and amortization) include salaries, bonuses, commissions, stock-based compensation and employee benefit costs primarily related to individuals directly associated with providing services to our customers. Our cost of revenues (excluding depreciation and amortization) are dependent on the revenue mix and therefore can slightly increase or decrease in the future as a percentage of revenue over the long term. 
 General and administrative expenses 
 General and administrative expenses primarily consist of computer and telecom expenses, employee-related costs, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and employee benefits costs associated with our executives, finance, legal, human resources and other administrative personnel, as well as accounting and legal professional services fees and platform and related infrastructure costs. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods. We expect that general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue over the long term. 
 Selling and marketing expenses 
 Selling and marketing expenses primarily consist of employee-related costs, including salaries, bonuses, employee benefits costs, stock-based compensation and commission costs for our sales and marketing personnel. Selling and marketing expenses also include costs for market development programs, advertising, promotional and other marketing activities. We intend to continue to invest in marketing initiatives and as a result we expect selling and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods. Selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue may fluctuate from period to period based on revenue levels and the timing of our investments in these functions over the long term. 
 Research and development expenses 
 Research and development expenses primarily consist of employee-related costs, including salaries, bonuses and employee benefit costs, stock-based compensation associated with engineering and IT services associated with the ongoing research and maintenance of internal use software. We expect to continue to invest in research and development in order to develop our technology platform to drive incremental value and growth and as a result we expect that research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period as a percentage of revenue over the long term. 
 Depreciation and amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization relate to property and equipment, website and software development costs as well as acquisition-related and other acquired intangible assets. We record depreciation and amortization using straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the assets. 
 23 

Acquisition-related expenses 
 Acquisition-related expenses primarily consist of legal and professional services fees and employee related expenses that are associated with business combinations. We expect that acquisition-related expenses will be correlated with future acquisitions (if any), which could be greater than or less than our historic levels. 
 Restructuring expenses 
 Restructuring expenses primarily consist of employee termination costs due to internal restructuring. We expect that restructuring expenses will be correlated with future restructuring activities (if any), which could be greater than or less than our historic levels. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized 2.8 million of restructuring expenses. We did not have any such restructuring expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Interest expense 
 Interest expense primarily consists of interest payable on our long-term borrowings, net of interest earned on our short-term investments in money market accounts and other short-term deposits. We anticipate interest expense to be impacted by changes in variable interest rates. 
 Other expenses 
 Other expenses primarily consist of changes in fair value of acquisition-related liabilities, gains and losses on sale of assets and foreign exchange gains and losses. We expect that the magnitude of other income and expenses will depend on external factors such as foreign exchange rates and the remeasurement impact of acquisition-related liabilities, which depends on the performance of our acquisitions, and could be greater than or less than our historic levels. 
 Income tax provision 
 The Company s income tax provision consists of federal, foreign, and state taxes necessary to align the Company s year-to-date tax provision with the annual effective rate that it expects to achieve for the full year. At each interim period, the Company updates its estimate of the annual effective tax rate and records cumulative adjustments as necessary. 
 Stock-based compensation 
 The measurement of stock-based compensation for all stock-based payment awards, including restricted stock, performance stock units PSUs and stock options granted to employees, consultants or advisors and non-employee directors, and shares purchased under the Company s employee stock purchase plan ESPP ), is based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant or date of modification of such grants. See "Note 9. Stock-Based Compensation" of our condensed unaudited consolidated financial statements for further details. 
 We estimate the recognition of unrecognized stock-based compensation as follows, subject to future forfeitures:

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We use the following non-GAAP financial information, collectively, to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. Non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Whenever we use a non-GAAP financial measure, a reconciliation is provided to the most closely applicable financial measure stated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures may be useful to investors in analyzing our financial and operational performance. 
 Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin 
 Adjusted EBITDA: is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as net loss adjusted for interest expense, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, income tax (benefit) / provision, acquisition related expenses, restructuring expenses, change in fair value of warrants and derivative liabilities, certain dispute settlement expenses, gain on extinguishment of debt, certain non-recurring capital raise related (including IPO) expenses, including the payroll taxes related to vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units upon the completion of the IPO, and other expenses. Acquisition related expenses and restructuring expenses primarily consist of professional services fees, severance and other employee-related costs, which may vary from period to period depending on the timing of our acquisitions and restructuring activities and may distort the comparability of the results of operations. Change in fair value of warrants and derivative liabilities is a non-cash expense related to periodically recording mark-to-market changes in the valuation of derivatives and warrants. Other expenses consist of non-cash expenses such as changes in fair value of acquisition related liabilities, gains and losses on extinguishment of acquisition related liabilities, gains and losses on sales of assets and foreign exchange gains and losses. In particular, we believe that the exclusion of stock-based compensation, certain dispute settlement expenses and non-recurring capital raise related (including IPO) expenses that are not related to our core operations provides measures for period-to-period comparisons of our business and provides additional insight into our core controllable costs. We exclude these charges because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing business and operating results. Adjusted EBITDA margin is a non-GAAP metric defined as adjusted EBITDA divided by the total revenues for the same period. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin provide us with a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business as well as comparison to our peers. Our use of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP. Because of these and other limitations, you should consider our non-GAAP measures only as supplemental to other GAAP-based financial performance measures, including revenues and net loss. 
 The following table reconciles adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to net loss and net loss margin, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We have financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily through utilization of cash generated from operations, as well as borrowings under our credit facilities. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we raised equity capital through an underwritten public offering of our Class A common stock, and issued 10,304,716 shares of Class A common stock, including 1,584,000 shares sold pursuant to the underwriters full exercise of their option to purchase additional shares, at an offering price of 23.50 per share. The gross proceeds from the offering were 242.2 million, and net proceeds after underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses were approximately 228.9 million. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 418.5 million and net working capital, consisting of current assets less current liabilities of 443.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 1,043.5 million. 
 We believe our existing cash and anticipated net cash provided by operating activities, together with available borrowings under our Revolving Facility (as defined below), will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. However, if our operating performance during the next 12 months is below our expectations, our liquidity and ability to operate our business could be adversely affected. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those set forth under "Risk Factors" in our 2023 Annual Report. In the future, we may attempt to raise additional capital through sales of equity securities or through equity-linked or debt financing arrangements. Any future indebtedness we incur may result in terms that could be unfavorable to our equity investors. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to raise additional capital in the future on favorable terms, or at all. Any inability to raise capital could adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities of 90.2 million resulted primarily from adjusted non-cash items of 192.6 million, more than offsetting our net loss of 85.0 million. Non-cash items include stock-based compensation of 152.0 million, depreciation and amortization of 39.3 million and a change in fair value of acquisition-related liabilities of 1.4 million. Changes in working capital were primarily driven by decreases in accounts payable of 4.0 million, increases in accounts receivable of 34.5 million and prepaid expenses of 3.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of 25.2 million. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by operating activities of 63.6 million resulted primarily from adjusted noncash items of 225.2 million, an amount in excess of our net loss of 152.2 million. Non-cash items include stock-based compensation of 179.7 million, depreciation and amortization of 37.7 million, and a change in fair value of acquisition-related liabilities of 6.7 million. Changes in working capital were primarily driven by an increase in accounts receivable of 33.3 million, other assets of 0.6 million and a decrease in deferred revenue of 0.3 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of 22.6 million, accrued expenses and other current liabilities of 1.2 million and a decrease in prepaid expenses of 0.9 million. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used 29.6 million of cash in investing activities, primarily consisting of capital expenditures of 17.5 million (including a 14.0 million investment in data and partnership agreements) and website and software development costs of 12.1 million. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we used 45.5 million of cash in investing activities, primarily consisting of capital expenditures of 14.9 million (including a 11.7 million investment in data and partnership agreements), 
 31 

acquisitions and other investments, net of cash acquired of 18.3 million and website and software development costs of 12.3 million. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities of 226.2 million resulted primarily from the equity capital raise of 229.3 million, net proceeds from the credit facility refinancing of 11.6 million and receipt from the ESPP and exercise of options of 4.5 million, partially offset by the repurchase of 12.3 million of common stock under our share repurchase and withholding program and payment of acquisition-related liabilities of 7.0 million. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we used 18.4 million of cash in financing activities, primarily due to the repurchase of 11.5 million of our common stock under our share repurchase and withholdings program and payment of acquisition-related liabilities of 8.7 million, partially offset by 1.6 million paid by certain employees under the ESPP. 
 Debt 
 On February 3, 2021, we entered into a credit agreement (the Existing Credit Agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions and institutional lenders, providing for a 222.5 million senior secured credit facility (the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facility ), which consisted of (i) a 73.8 million initial revolving facility, (ii) a 111.3 million term loan facility, and (iii) a 37.5 million incremental revolving facility commitment. On March 22, 2023, the Company entered into a 25.0 million incremental revolving facility commitment pursuant to an amendment to the Existing Credit Agreement, thereby increasing the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facility to 247.5 million. 
 On August 30, 2024, we refinanced and replaced the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facility by entering into a new credit agreement (the Credit Agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions and institutional lenders, providing for a five-year 550 million senior secured credit facility (the Senior Secured Credit Facility ), which consists of (i) a senior secured term A loan in an aggregate principal amount of 200 million (the Term Loan and (ii) a 350 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Facility ). Concurrently with entering into the Credit Agreement, we drew down the 200 million Term Loan and repaid all outstanding obligations in the amount of 185 million under the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facility and terminated all commitments thereunder. Interest shall be payable at the end of the selected interest period, but no less frequently than quarterly. We are required to repay the principal balance and any unpaid accrued interest on the Senior Secured Credit Facility on August 30, 2029. As of September 30, 2024, we have 200 million (net of 3.9 million of unamortized debt acquisition costs) of outstanding long-term borrowings. 
 We are currently in compliance with our financial maintenance covenants under the Senior Secured Credit Facility, and, based upon our current expectations, believe that we will continue to comply with our financial maintenance covenants for the next 12 months. The Senior Secured Credit Facility contains restrictive covenants that place restrictions on us and may limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional debt and liens, purchase our securities, undertake transactions with affiliates, make other investments, pay dividends or distribute excess cash flow. 
 Contractual obligations 
 There have been no material changes to our contractual obligations as compared to the contractual obligations described in our "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" set forth in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 Share Repurchase and RSA Withholding Program 
 In August 2022, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase and withholding program (the 2022 SRP authorizing the repurchase of up to 50 million of our outstanding Class A common stock through December 31, 2024 and authorizing withholding as an alternative to market sales by executives to satisfy tax withholding requirements upon vesting of restricted stock awards RSAs ). As such, we may use corporate cash to make required tax payments associated with the vesting of certain executive RSAs and withhold a corresponding number of shares from such executives. The actual timing, number and value of shares repurchased will be determined by the Company at its discretion and will depend on a number of factors, including market conditions, applicable legal requirements, our capital needs, and whether there is a better alternative use of capital. Repurchases and withholdings during any given fiscal period under the 2022 SRP will reduce the number of weighted-average common shares outstanding for the period. Repurchases and withholdings during any given fiscal period under the 2022 SRP will reduce the number of weighted-average common shares outstanding for the period. Refer to Part II, Item 2 for details of repurchases made under the 2022 SRP during the three month ended September 30, 2024.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates are based on management s judgment and the best available information, and as such actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates described in our "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" set forth in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements and do not have any holdings in variable interest entities. 
 
 Item 3. 	 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 We are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial condition due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange risks. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our Term Loan borrowings, which accrue interest at a variable rate. As of September 30, 2024, we have not entered into any derivative financial instrument contracts to mitigate the interest rate risk on our 200.0 million Term Loan, and as a result, we are subject to the potential impact of rising interest rates, which could negatively impact our profitability and cash flows. Based upon the principal balance owed on our long-term borrowings as of September 30, 2024, a hypothetical one percentage point increase or decrease in the interest would increase or decrease our annual interest expense by 2 million. There were no material changes in market risk exposures as of September 30, 2024. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 We have foreign currency risks related to a certain number of our foreign subsidiaries in the UK, France, Belgium and India. We do not believe that a 10 change in the relative value of the U.S. dollar to other foreign currencies would have a material effect on our cash flows and operating results in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. 
 Inflation Risk 
 In 2023, inflation increased significantly in the United States and overseas, resulting in rising wages and other costs. We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset higher costs through price increases, and our inability or failure to do so could potentially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Item 4. 	 Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures, and is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 
 Our management, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. While our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of their effectiveness, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. 	 Legal Proceedings 
 In the ordinary course of our business, we are subject to claims and administrative proceedings, none of which we believe are material or would be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Company s business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. The outcome of claims, lawsuits and legal proceedings brought against us, however, is subject to significant uncertainties. There have been no material changes from the legal proceedings previously disclosed under the heading Item 3. Legal Proceedings in Part I of our 2023 Annual Report. 
 Item 1A . 	 Risk Factors 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in Part 1, Item 1A Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report.
