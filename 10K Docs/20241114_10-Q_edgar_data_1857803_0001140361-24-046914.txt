 market value of at least of the net assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the amount of deferred underwriting discounts held in the Trust Account and taxes

However, the Company only intends to complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires or more of the issued and outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be
 required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ). Upon the closing of the Public Offering, management agreed that an amount equal to at least per Unit sold in the Public Offering, would be held in a Trust Account located in the United States with Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company acting as
 trustee, and invested only in United States government securities within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7
 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust
 Account as described below. On November 7, 2023, in order to mitigate the potential risks of being deemed to have been operating as an unregistered investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, the Company entered into an amendment

 connection with a shareholders meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer
 will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The Public Shareholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then held in the Trust Account (initially per Public Share). The per-share amount to be distributed to Public Shareholders who redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred
 underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriters (as discussed in Note 6, Commitments and Contingencies ). These Public Shares were recorded at a redemption value and classified as
 temporary equity upon the completion of the Public Offering in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board s FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. If the Company
 seeks shareholder approval, the Company will proceed with a Business Combination if a majority of the shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. If a shareholder vote is not required by law and the Company does not decide to
 hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Fourth A R M A, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and file
 tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, shareholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain shareholder approval for business or legal reasons, the
 Company will offer to redeem the Public Shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. Additionally, each Public Shareholder may elect to redeem its Public Shares
 irrespective of whether such Public Shareholder votes for or against the proposed transaction. If the Company seeks shareholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the holders of the Founder Shares (as defined below in Note 5)

 redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and Public Shares in connection with the completion of a Business Combination.

 case to the Company s obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. As of the date of filing this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company has not entered into any
 non-binding or definitive agreements with a potential Business Combination target.

. In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust
 Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party (except for the Company s independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or by a
 prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement (a Target ), reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (i) per Public Share or (ii) the lesser amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in the
 value of the trust assets, in each case net of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes. Such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or Target that executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account.
 Such liability will also not apply to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of the Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). In
 the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the
 Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than the Company s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other
 entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.

As of December 31, 2023, in
 connection with the Original Extension and the first and second Optional Extensions, the Sponsor agreed to transfer to the Investors an aggregate of 
 Class B ordinary shares promptly after the consummation of the Business Combination. The excess of the fair value of the Class B ordinary shares was determined to be an offering cost in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5A.
 Subsequently, in connection with the third Optional Extension which was approved by the Company s board of directors on January 8, 2024 (as discussed below), the Sponsor agreed to transfer an additional Class B ordinary shares, in the aggregate, to the Investors, amounting to a total aggregate amount of Class B ordinary shares to be transferred to the Investors by the Sponsor on or promptly after the consummation of the Business Combination pursuant to the

. The current cash position from the net proceeds of the Public Offering, the sale of the Private Placement Warrants and the Sponsor Loan not being held in the
 Trust Account are insufficient to allow us to operate until November 12, 2025, and, as such, the Company will likely depend on capital calls and or loans from our Sponsor, its affiliates or members of the Company s management team to fund our
 search, and to complete a Business Combination. The Sponsor, its affiliates, or members of the Company s management team are not under any obligation to advance additional funds to, or to invest in, and the Company may still need additional capital
 to fund its working capital needs and search for a target. Also, if the Company s estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating the Business Combination is less than the actual amount necessary
 to do so, the Company may need to obtain funding sooner. The Company s working capital has not been determined to be sufficient to fund its operations for at least one year from the date of issuance of the unaudited condensed financial
 statement. Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date of these financial statements.

 accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5A. In substance, the Company recognized the offering cost as a capital contribution by the Sponsor to induce the Investors not to redeem their Class A ordinary shares, with a corresponding

Overview

We are a blank check company incorporated on April 8, 2021 as a Cayman Islands exempted company and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase,
 reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities (the Business Combination that we have not yet identified. We are an emerging growth company and, as such, we are subject to all of the risks associated with
 emerging growth companies. We completed our Public Offering on November 12, 2021. As of September 30, 2024, we had not identified any Business Combination target.

We presently have no revenue and have had no operations other than the active solicitation of a target business with which to complete a Business Combination.

We expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our Business Combination. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete a Business Combination will be successful.

Our registration statement for our Public Offering was declared effective on November 8, 2021. On November 12, 2021, we consummated our Public Offering of 23,000,000 units (the Units ), which included
 the exercise in full of the underwriter s option to purchase an additional 3,000,000 Units at the Public Offering price to cover over-allotments. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share, par value 0.0001 per share (the Class A ordinary
 shares ), and one-half of one redeemable warrant (the Public Warrants ), each whole Public Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share at an exercise price of 11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. The Units were
 sold at a price of 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 230.0 million.

Simultaneously with the closing of the Public Offering, we consummated the private sale (the Private Placement of 4,733,333 warrants (the Private Placement Warrants to DP Investment Management
 Sponsor I LLC (the Sponsor ), each exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share at 11.50 per share, at a price of 1.50 per Private Placement Warrant, generating total gross proceeds of 7.1 million.

Table of Contents 

Simultaneously with the closing of the Public Offering, pursuant to the Sponsor s promissory note (the Sponsor Note ), the Sponsor loaned 4,600,000 to the Company (the Sponsor Loan ). The Sponsor
 Loan is interest free. The Sponsor Loan shall be repaid or converted into warrants (the Sponsor Loan Warrants at a purchase price of 1.50 per Sponsor Loan Warrant, at the Sponsor s discretion and at any time until the consummation of our initial
 Business Combination. Any Sponsor Loan Warrants issued will be identical to the Private Placement Warrants.

Upon the closing of our Public Offering, a total of 234.6 million 10.20 per unit), comprised of 225.4 million of the proceeds from the Public Offering (which amount includes 8.05 million of the
 underwriter s deferred discount), 4.6 million of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants and 4.6 million of the proceeds from the Sponsor Loan, were placed in a U.S.- based trust account Trust Account maintained by
 Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company acting as trustee. The funds held in the Trust Account may be invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended
 (the Investment Company Act ), with a maturity of 185 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by us meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined
 by us, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account as described below.

Our management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of our Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the
 net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. There is no assurance that we will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully.

We must complete one or more Business Combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80 of the net assets held in the Trust Account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working
 capital purposes, if permitted, and excluding the amount of deferred underwriting discounts held in trust) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our Business Combination. However, we only intend to complete a Business
 Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50 or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment
 company under the Investment Company Act.

If we are unable to complete a Business Combination by November 12, 2025, and our shareholders have not amended our fourth amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (the Fourth
 A R M A to extend the combination period, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter subject to lawfully available funds
 therefor, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay
 our taxes (if any) (less up to 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of the then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right
 to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law; and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and
 dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.

On May 5, 2023, certain of our unaffiliated investors (the Investors entered into non-redemption agreements Non-Redemption Agreements with the Sponsor,
 pursuant to which the Investors agreed to (i) not redeem an aggregate of up to 4,000,000 previously-held Class A ordinary shares (the Investor Shares in connection with the First Extension (as defined below) and (ii) vote the Investor Shares in
 favor of the First Extension. In exchange for these commitments from the Investors, the Sponsor has agreed to transfer to the Investors (i) an aggregate of up to 1,000,000 Class B ordinary shares in connection with an extension until November 12,
 2023 and (ii) to the extent our board of directors agrees to further extend the date up to three times by an additional month each time until February 12, 2024 to consummate its Business Combination, an aggregate of up to 1,500,000 Class B ordinary
 shares, which includes the Class B ordinary shares referred to in clause (i), in each case, on or promptly after the consummation of the Business Combination.

On May 10, 2023, we held an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the First Extraordinary General Meeting at which our shareholders voted to approve to amend and restate our amended and
 restated memorandum and articles of association to extend the date (the Extension Date by which we must (1) consummate our Business Combination, (2) cease our operations except for the purpose of winding up if we fail to complete such Business
 Combination, and (3) redeem all of the Class A ordinary shares included as part of the Units sold in the Public Offering, from May 12, 2023 to November 12, 2023, with optional additional extensions of up to three times by an additional month each
 time, at the option of our board of directors, until February 12, 2024 (the First Extension ).

In connection with the First Extension, shareholders holding 18,940,598 Class A ordinary shares issued in our Public Offering exercised their right to redeem such shares at a per share redemption price
 of 10.51. As a result, approximately 199.0 million was removed from our Trust Account to pay such holders. Following these redemptions, we had 4,059,402 Class A ordinary shares with redemption rights outstanding.

In connection with the approval of the Second Extension, the Sponsor has agreed to deposit on a monthly basis, or pro rata portion thereof if less than a month, 49,500 into our Trust Account for the
 benefit of our public shareholders (the Extension Deposit ), until the earlier of (i) the date of the extraordinary general meeting held in connection with the shareholder vote to approve a Business Combination and (ii) November 12, 2024 (or any

 Shareholders and us in connection with our Public Offering. Following such conversion, and as a result of the redemptions described above, as of March 15, 2024, we had an aggregate of 7,249,997 Class A ordinary shares issued and outstanding, of which
 1,500,000 Class A ordinary shares issued and outstanding are with redemption rights, and three Founder Shares issued and outstanding.

Application for Transfer to The Nasdaq Capital Market

On August 21, 2023, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications staff (the Nasdaq Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq notifying us that we were not in compliance with Nasdaq
 Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(A), which requires that our listed securities maintain a minimum Market Value of Listed Securities MVLS of 50 million (the MVLS Rule ). Subsequently on March 11, 2024, the Nasdaq Staff notified us that we have regained

 an aggregate of approximately 16.9 million was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders. Following this redemption, we have 48,095 Class A Ordinary Shares with redemption rights outstanding. As of November 13, 2024, 0.56 million
 remained in the Trust Account.

On November 12, 2024, we received a delisting notice from Nasdaq that, as we were not able to complete a business
 combination within 36 months of the effectiveness of our IPO registration statement, or November 8, 2024, as required under Nasdaq Listing Rule IM-5101-2(b) (the Rule ), unless we timely request a hearing before a Nasdaq hearings panel, our
 securities will be suspended from trading at the opening of business on November 19, 2024 and will be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market. While we may appeal the suspension and delisting, a Nasdaq hearings panel will have no discretion in
 allowing us to remain listed and may only reverse the Nasdaq s staff s determination if it finds it made a factual error applying the Rule. We have decided not to appeal the suspension and delisting. 

Results of Operations

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net income (loss) of 34,794 and (239,189), respectively, which consisted of earnings on cash (investments) held in trust of 183,818
 and 691,273, respectively, offset by general and administrative costs of 149,024 and 930,462, respectively.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had net income of 275,282 and 3,517,704, respectively, which consisted of earnings on investments held in Trust Account of 562,845 and
 4,778,599, respectively, partially offset by general and administrative expenses of 287,563 and 1,260,895 (including formation expenses), respectively.

All activity from April 8, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2024, relates to our formation and our Public Offering and subsequent to our Public Offering, the search for a target for our Business
 Combination. We will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our Business Combination, at the earliest.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The registration statement for our Public Offering was declared effective by the SEC on November 8, 2021. On November 12, 2021, we consummated our Public Offering of 23,000,000 Units, inclusive of the
 underwriters election to exercise their option to purchase an additional 3,000,000 Units, at a price of 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 230,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the Public Offering, we consummated the sale of
 4,733,333 Private Placement Warrants to our Sponsor at a price of 1.50 per warrant, generating gross proceeds of 7,100,000. On the Close Date, our Sponsor loaned us 4,600,000 under the Sponsor Loan.

Following the Public Offering, the sale of the Private Placement Warrants and the issuance of the proceeds under the Sponsor Loan, a total of 234,600,000 was placed in the Trust Account, which
 consisted of 225,400,000 from the proceeds from the Public Offering, 4,600,000 from the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants and 4,600,000 from the proceeds from the Sponsor Loan. We incurred 13,148,152 in transaction costs,
 including 4,600,000 of underwriting fees, 8,050,000 of deferred underwriting fees and 498,152 of other costs.

Our liquidity needs up to September 30, 2024 had been satisfied through (i) a payment from the Sponsor along with certain funds controlled by Data Point Capital
 of 25,000 to cover certain offering and formation costs in exchange for the issuance of the Founder Shares to the Sponsor and (ii) the receipt of loans to us of up to 300,000 by the Sponsor under an unsecured promissory note. The unsecured
 promissory note was non-interest bearing and was due at the earlier of December 31, 2021 and the closing of the Public Offering. As of September 30, 2024, no amounts were outstanding under the unsecured promissory note. In addition, in order to
 finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, provide us working capital loans. In the period ended September
 30, 2024, related parties have advanced an aggregate of 935,116 in capital contributions to the Company for the purpose of funding extension deposits and other working capital needs; however, the Company may still need additional capital to fund its
 working capital needs and search for a target. As of September 30, 2024, and through the date of this filling, there were no amounts outstanding under any working capital loans.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 690,012, consisting of net loss of (239,189), earnings on cash held in Trust Account of 691,273 and changes in
 operating assets and liabilities of 240,450, resulting primarily from increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in operating activities was 366,062, consisting of net income of 3,517,704, earnings on investments held in Trust Account of 4,778,599 and changes in operating
 assets and liabilities of 894,833, resulting primarily from increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses.

As of September 30, 2024, we had cash held in the Trust Account of 17,318,372. As of December 31, 2023, we have investments held in Trust Account of 44,290,118. At the Second Extraordinary General
 Meeting held on February 8, 2024, in connection with the Second Extension, holders of an additional 2,559,402 Class A ordinary shares properly exercised their right to redeem their Class A ordinary shares for cash at a redemption price of
 approximately 10.96 per share. As a result, an aggregate of approximately 28 million was removed from our Trust Account to pay such holders. We may withdraw interest earned to pay our income taxes, if any. We intend to use substantially all of the
 funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and excluding deferred underwriting commissions) to complete our Business Combination. To the
 extent that our share capital is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete a Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or
 businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies.

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash of 258,747 and 409,643, respectively, held outside of the Trust Account. We intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Account primarily
 to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review
 corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, structure, negotiate and complete a Business Combination, and to pay our other operating expenses. In the period ended September 30, 2024, related parties have advanced an
 aggregate of 935,116 in capital contributions to the Company. The Company utilized 396,000 of this contribution to fund extension deposits paid into the Trust Account and the remainder is available to the Company for working capital needs.

Table of Contents 

In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, our Sponsor or an affiliate of our Sponsor or certain of our officers and directors
 may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete a Business Combination, we would repay such loaned amounts or, in the case of Working Capital Loans, such loans may be converted into warrants of the Company at the
 option of the lender. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the cash held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts, but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment.

We believe we will need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business. Additionally, if our estimate of the costs of identifying a target business,
 undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a Business Combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our Business Combination. Moreover, we may need to
 obtain additional financing either to complete our Business Combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our then outstanding public shares upon completion of our Business Combination, in which case we may issue
 additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination.

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, other than the 4,600,000 Sponsor Loan, we did not have other long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating
 lease obligations or long-term liabilities.

Going Concern Considerations

We have until November 12, 2025 to consummate a Business Combination. It is currently uncertain that we will be able to consummate a Business Combination by this time. If our Business Combination cannot
 be completed prior to November 12, 2025, we will cease operations except for the purpose of winding-up, redeem our outstanding public shares, and liquidate and dissolve unless, prior to such date, the Company receives an extension approval from its
 shareholders and elects to further extend the date on which a Business Combination must be consummated.

As of September 30, 2024, we had 258,747 in cash outside of the Trust Account for our working capital needs and a working capital deficit of 1,084,165. We expect to incur significant costs in pursuit
 of our acquisition plans and the net proceeds of the Public Offering, the sale of the Private Placement Warrants and the Sponsor Loan not being held in the Trust Account are insufficient to allow us to operate until November 12, 2025. The Company
 will likely depend on loans and or capital contributions from our Sponsor, its affiliates or members of the management team and/or third parties to fund our search and to complete a Business Combination. Further, if our estimates of the costs of
 undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating the Business Combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to a Business Combination. The Sponsor is not under
 any obligation to advance additional funds to, or to invest in, us. If we are unable to raise additional funds, we may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing
 operations, suspending the pursuit of our business plan, and reducing overhead expenses. We cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.

We continue our search for a target and will continue pursuing all options to complete a Business Combination by November 12, 2025. It is uncertain whether we will be able to consummate a Business
 Combination by November 12, 2025 or whether the current funds that we have will be sufficient to consummate a Business Combination. If a Business Combination is not consummated by November 12, 2025, we will cease operations except for the purpose of
 winding up, redeem the then outstanding Public Shares, and liquidate and dissolve unless, prior to such date, we receive an extension approval from our shareholders and elect to extend the date on which a Business Combination must be consummated.
 These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the date of this Quarterly Report. These unaudited condensed financial statements do not include any adjustment that
 might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.

Commitments and Contingencies

Registration Rights

The holders of Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants and any warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans (and any Class A ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of the
 Private Placement Warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of the working capital loans) are entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement. The holders of these securities are entitled to make up to three
 demands, excluding short form demands, that we register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to our completion of our Business Combination.
 However, the registration rights agreement provides that we will not permit any registration statement filed under the Securities Act to become effective until termination of the applicable lockup period, which occurs (i) in the case of the Founder
 Shares, until the earliest of (A) one year after the completion of our Business Combination and (B) subsequent to our Business Combination, (x) if the closing price of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds 12.00 per share (as adjusted for
 share sub-divisions, share capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 120 days after our Business Combination, or (y) the date on which we complete a
 liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of our public shareholders having the right to exchange their ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property, and (ii) in the case of the Private Placement
 Warrants and the respective Class A ordinary shares underlying such warrants, 30 days after the completion of our Business Combination. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.

Underwriting Agreement

We granted the underwriter a 45-day option from the date of the Public Offering to purchase on a pro rata basis up to 3,000,000 additional Units to cover
 over-allotments, if any, at the Public Offering price, less the underwriting discounts and commissions. The over-allotment option was exercised in full on November 12, 2021.

The underwriter was entitled to an underwriting discount of 0.20 per Unit, or 4.6 million in the aggregate, paid upon the closing of the Public Offering. An additional fee of 0.35 per Unit, or 8.05
 million in the aggregate will be payable to the underwriter for deferred underwriting commissions. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriter from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that we complete a Business
 Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

This management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
 generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of our Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets
 and liabilities in our Financial Statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to fair value of financial instruments and accrued expenses. We base our estimates on known trends and events and
 various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual
 results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed on April 10, 2024 for our critical accounting policies and estimates. There have
 been no changes in these policies since the filing of this Form 10-K/A.

JOBS Act

The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. We qualify as an emerging growth company and under the JOBS Act are
 allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We are electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply
 with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, the Financial Statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised
 accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates.

Additionally, we are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act,
 if, as an emerging growth company, we choose to rely on such exemptions we may not be required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404
 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be
 adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis)
 and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executive officer s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will
 apply for a period of five years from the completion of our Public Offering or until we are no longer an emerging growth company, whichever is earlier.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange
 Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
 designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in company reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting
 officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

As required by Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design
 and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Due to identified material weaknesses in our
 internal control over financial reporting identified in current and previous reporting periods, as described below, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
 were not effective as of September 30, 2024.

Notwithstanding the conclusion by our principal executive officer and principal financial officer that our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 were not effective, and
 notwithstanding the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below, management believes that the unaudited condensed financial statements and related financial information included in this Quarterly Report fairly
 present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as of the dates presented, and for the periods ended on such dates, in conformity with GAAP.

Material Weakness

A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the
 Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As previously disclosed in our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the SEC on April 10, 2024, management identified a
 deficiency in internal control over financial reporting related to the accounting for complex financial instruments and the review and approval of adjusting journal entries. As of September 30, 2024, the identified material weaknesses in our internal
 controls over financial reporting have not yet been remediated.

Remediation Plan

Management plans to remediate the material weaknesses by 1) incorporating additional controls and procedures over the review of complex financial instrument
 valuations, 2) increasing communication among our personnel and third-party professionals with whom we consult regarding accounting applications and 3) incorporating additional procedures over the review of the general ledger and the review and
 approval of adjustment to journal entries. The elements of our remediation plan can only be accomplished over time, and we can offer no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
 materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

RISK FACTORS 

Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this Quarterly Report are any of the risks described in the Risk Factors sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A
 filed with the SEC on April 10, 2024. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. We may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional factors from time
 to time in our future filings with the SEC.

As of the date of this Quarterly Report, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023, other than as set
 forth below:

Risks related to Potential Delisting of Securities from Nasdaq

The Company s securities are listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Pursuant to Nasdaq rules, the Company is currently required to consummate its initial
 business combination within 36 months from its original listing date. The Company s securities were listed on Nasdaq in November 2021. As the Third Extension was approved and effectuated, the Company has until November 12, 2025 pursuant to its
 charter to consummate an initial business combination. As a result, the Company could continue to seek to consummate its initial business combination beyond 36 months from the original listing date. Nasdaq Rule 5815 was recently amended to provide
 for the immediate suspension and delisting of a listed company upon issuance of a delisting determination letter for failure to meet the requirement in Nasdaq Rule IM 5101-2(b), which requires a company to complete one or more business combinations
 within 36 months of the date of effectiveness of its IPO registration statement. Accordingly, the Company s securities will face immediate suspension and delisting action once the Company receives a delisting determination letter from Nasdaq after
 the 36-month window ends on November 8, 2024. Pursuant to Rule 5815, as amended, Nasdaq may only reverse the determination if it finds it made a factual error applying such rule. On November 12, 2024, the Company received a delisting notice from
 Nasdaq that, as it was not able to complete a business combination within 36 months of the effectiveness of its IPO registration statement, or November 8, 2024, as required under Nasdaq Listing Rule IM-5101-2(b), unless the Company timely requests
 a hearing before a Nasdaq hearings panel, its securities will be suspended from trading at the opening of business on November 19, 2024 and will be delisted from the Nasdaq Stock Market. The Company has decided not to appeal the suspension and
 delisting.

Once Nasdaq delists any of the Company s securities from trading on its exchange and the Company is not able to list such securities on another
 approved national securities exchange, the Company expects that such securities could be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, the Company could face significant material adverse consequences, including: (i) a limited
 availability of market quotations for the Company s securities, (ii) reduced demand and liquidity for the Company s securities, (iii) a determination that the Public Shares are penny stocks and no longer covered securities, which will require
 brokers trading in the Public Shares to adhere to more stringent rules, including being subject to the depository requirements of Rule 419 of the Securities Act, and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading
 market for the Company s securities making it more difficult for investors to trade the Company s securities, (iv) a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future, and (v) making the Company a less
 attractive acquisition vehicle to a target business in connection with an initial business combination. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the Company s ability to consummate an initial business combination and make it
 significantly harder to consummate such an initial business combination.

Unregistered Sales

Use of Proceeds

On November 8, 2021, our registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-260456) was declared effective by the SEC for the Public Offering pursuant to which we sold an aggregate of 23,000,000 Units,
 inclusive of the underwriters election to exercise their option to purchase an additional 3,000,000 Units, at an offering price to the public of 10.00 per Unit for an aggregate offering price of 230,000,000, with each Unit consisting of one Class
 A ordinary share of the Company at 0.0001 par value and one-half of one warrant. Each whole warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of 11.50 per share.

29 

Table of Contents 

Net proceeds of 230,000,000 from the Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, including deferred underwriting discounts of 8,050,000, were deposited into the Trust Account on
 the Close Date and 4,600,000 of the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants was deposited in our operating account for future working capital expenditures. We paid 4,600,000 in underwriting discounts and incurred offering costs of
 498,152 related to the Public Offering. In addition, the Underwriters agreed to defer 8,050,000 in underwriting discounts, which amount will be payable when and if a business combination is consummated. No payments were made by us to directors,
 officers or persons owning ten percent or more of our Class A ordinary shares or to their associates, or to our affiliates.

In connection with the First Extension adopted at the First Extraordinary General Meeting held on May 10, 2023, we paid approximately 199.0 million in redemption proceeds to shareholders holding
 18,940,598 Class A ordinary shares who exercised their right to redeem such shares at a per share redemption price of 10.51.

In connection with the Second Extension adopted at the Second Extraordinary General Meeting held on February 8, 2024, we paid approximately 28 million in redemption proceeds to shareholders holding
 2,559,402 Class A ordinary shares who exercised their right to redeem such shares at a per share redemption price of 10.96.

In connection with the Third Extension adopted at the Third Extraordinary General Meeting held on November 11, 2024, we paid approximately 16.9 million in
 redemption proceeds to shareholders holding 1,451,905 Class A ordinary shares who exercised their right to redeem such shares at a per share redemption price of 11.63.

Other than as described above, there has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds from the Public Offering as described in our final Prospectus, dated November 8, 2021, which was filed
 with the SEC on November 10, 2021.
