Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), that involve risks and uncertainties, including statements based on our current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections about future events, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, our industry and the regulatory environment in which we operate. Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical facts may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as anticipate, believe, could, estimate, expect, intend, may, plan, potential, predict, project, should, will, would or the negative of those terms, or other comparable terms intended to identify statements about the future. The forward-looking statements included herein are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond our control, include, but are not limited to those described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2023 and in the filings we make with Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC from time to time. 
 We are an early-stage company with a history of significant net losses, we expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability. 

Our common stock has been delisted from the New York Stock Exchange NYSE and is currently trading on the OTC Markets Group Inc. s OTC OTCQX U.S. tier (the OTCQX ). If we are unable to comply with the continued listing requirements of the OTCQX, our common stock could be moved to the OTC Pink market, which could further affect our common stock s market price and liquidity and reduce our ability to raise capital. 

The market price of our common stock may be volatile and an active trading market may not develop. 

Our revenue is primarily generated from sales of our GentleWave Console and the accompanying single-use procedure instruments PIs and we are therefore highly dependent on the success of these offerings. 

Our future operating results may be difficult to predict and could fall below expectations or any guidance we may provide. 

The terms of our credit agreement contain operating and financial covenants and place restrictions on our operating and financial flexibility. 

We need additional funding to finance our planned operations, and may not be able to raise capital when needed. 

The commercial success of our GentleWave System and the GentleWave Procedure will depend upon the degree of market acceptance of our products by dental practitioners, our ability to maintain strong working relationships with our existing clinicians and dental customers and our ability to increase penetration in existing markets and expand into adjacent markets. 

We may provide inadequate training, fail to increase our sales and marketing capabilities or fail to develop and maintain broad brand awareness in a cost-effective manner. 

We may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate levels of third party coverage and reimbursement. 

We may not be able to achieve or maintain satisfactory pricing and margins for our products. 

We may not be able to compete successfully. 

We may be unable to develop or commercialize new products on a timely basis and our products may become obsolete. 

We have limited experience manufacturing our products in large-scale commercial quantities and we face a number of manufacturing risks that may adversely affect our manufacturing abilities, which could delay, prevent or impair our growth. 

We depend upon third-party suppliers, including contract manufacturers and single source suppliers, making us vulnerable to supply shortages and price fluctuations that could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Any changes in our shipping arrangements or damages or losses sustained from shipping could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 

1 

Our operating expenses may substantially increase and our business and financial results will be adversely affected if we receive a significant number of warranty claims or our GentleWave Systems require significant amounts of service after sale. 

We may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, forecasting demand and managing inventory. 

Our internal computer systems or those used by our contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, and such failure could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Natural or man-made disasters and other similar events may significantly disrupt our business, including by causing delays in production or an increase in costs, and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

The sizes of the addressable markets for our GentleWave System have not been established with precision and our potential market opportunity may be smaller than we estimate and may decline. 

We may incur substantial liabilities and other negative impacts on our business as a result of product liability lawsuits and we may not be able to obtain or maintain insurance to cover these and other risks. 

Our insurance policies are expensive and protect us only from some business risks, which leaves us exposed to significant uninsured liabilities. 

Our products and operations are subject to extensive government regulation and oversight in the United States. 

Our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credit carryforwards may be limited. 

We are highly dependent on our senior management team. 

Our success depends on our ability to obtain and maintain our intellectual property. 

Anti-takeover provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, as well as those under Delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control. 

The effect of our reverse stock split on the market price and trading of our common stock cannot be predicted with any certainty. 

The sale of securities by us in any equity or debt financing could result in dilution to our existing stockholders. 

We are subject to additional risks and costs as a result of being a public company. 

We maintain cash deposits in excess of federally insured limits. Adverse developments affecting financial institutions, including bank failures, could adversely affect our liquidity and financial performance. 

We operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in, or implied by, any forward-looking statements. 
 The forward-looking statements included herein are based on current expectations of our management based on available information and are believed to be reasonable. In light of the significant risks and uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that such results will be achieved. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which speak only as of the date of this document. We do not intend, and undertake no obligation, to update or revise these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this document or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law.

 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOL IDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (unaudited) 
 million and million in principal outstanding under its term loan facility. The Company has a limited operating history, and the revenue and income potential of the Company s business and market are unproven. The Company has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations since its inception and as of September 30, 2024 had an accumulated deficit of million . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred net losses of million , used million of cash and cash equivalents in its continuing operations, and recognized a gain of million from sale of discontinued operations. The Company will continue to incur significant costs and expenses related to its ongoing operations until it gains greater market acceptance of its products and achieves a level of revenues adequate to support its operations. 

 8 

million of principal payments on its outstanding borrowings. Its plans are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties and there can be no assurance that its plans can be effectively implemented and, therefore, that the conditions can be effectively mitigated. The Company will require additional financing in order to fund its future expected negative cash flows. Due to its failure to comply with the continued listing standards set forth in the NYSE s Listed Company Manual, our common stock was suspended from trading on the NYSE effective at the opening of business Eastern Standard Time on November 22, 2023. The Company commenced trading on the OTCQX on the same day. In April 2024, the Company withdrew its request to appeal and the NYSE and our common stock has been delisted from the NYSE, which may negatively impact the Company s stockholders and the trading price and liquidity of its common stock. Over-the-counter markets are more limited than the NYSE, and it is likely that there will be significantly less liquidity in the trading of the Company s common stock. The delisting of the Company s common stock from the NYSE could have material adverse effects on its business, financial condition and results of operations. On June 4, 2024, the Company received notice from OTC that the Company s common stock no longer met the Standards for Continued Qualification for the OTCQX per the OTCQX Rules for U.S. Companies section 2.1(A) because the Company s stock bid price closed below for more than 30 consecutive calendar days. The Company had a cure period of 180 calendar days to regain compliance, which expires December 2, 2024. If the Company s bid price did not stay at or above the minimum for ten consecutive trading days during the cure period, then the Company s common stock would have been moved from OTCQX to the OTC Pink market. On June 10, 2024, the Company s shareholders approved an amendment to the Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of the Company s issued shares of common stock, at a specific ratio, ranging from 1:10 to 1:200 , at the discretion of the Company s board of directors at any time prior to the Company s 2025 annual meeting of stockholders, with the exact ratio to be determined by the Company s board of directors without further approval or authorization of the Company s stockholders. In September 2024, the Board approved a 1-for-200 reverse stock split. On October 16, 2024, the Company filed an amendment to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to implement a 1-for-200 reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding common stock, effective as of October 18, 2024. The reverse stock split correspondingly adjusted the per share exercise price of all outstanding options and all shares underlying any of the outstanding warrants by reducing the conversion ratio for each outstanding warrant and increasing the applicable exercise price or conversion price in accordance with the terms of each outstanding warrant and based on the reverse stock split ratio. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the reverse stock split. Stockholders who are entitled to fractional shares will receive a cash payment in lieu of receiving fractional shares (after taking into account and aggregating all shares of the Company s common stock then held by such stockholder) equal to the fractional share interest multiplied by (the per share closing price of the Company s common stock, on a post-split basis, as last reported on the OTCQX market on November 7, 2024). The reverse stock split was announced by FINRA on its OTC Daily List on November 7,2024 and took effect at the open of trading on November 8, 2024 on the OTCQX. Upon the effectiveness of the reverse stock split, the Company became compliant with OTCQX Rule 2.1(A). The number of shares of common stock authorized under the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation is unchanged at 500,000,000 shares. The accompanying interim unaudited condensed financial statements reflect the 1-for-200 reverse split of our common stock. All share and per share information data herein that relates to the Company's common stock prior to the effective date has been retroactively restated to reflect the reverse stock split. On November 7, 2024, the Company received notice from the OTC that the Company s common stock no longer met the Standards for Continued Qualification for the OTCQX per the OTCQX Rules for U.S. Companies section 2.1(B) because the Company s market capitalization has stayed below million for the past 30 consecutive calendar days. The Company has a cure period of 90 calendar days to regain compliance. The 90-calendar day grace period expires February 7, 2025 and at that time if the Company s market 

 9 

million for ten consecutive trading days then the Company's common stock will be removed from OTCQX and moved to the OTC Pink market. Effects of the Macroeconomic Environment The Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflect the Company s estimates of the impact of the macroeconomic environment, including the impact of inflation and higher interest rates. The duration and the scope of these conditions cannot be predicted; therefore, the extent to which these conditions will directly or indirectly impact the Company s business, results of operations and financial condition, is uncertain. The Company is not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require an update to its estimates, judgments and assumptions or a revision of the carrying value of the Company s assets or liabilities as of the date of this filing. Operating Segments The Company previously had operating and reportable segments: Product and Software. Following the divestiture of the software business on March 1, 2024, there were no substantial assets or operations remaining of the software segment. The software segment was reported as discontinued operations as of September 30, 2024, and is presented as such for all periods in this report. Emerging Growth Company Status The Company is an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ). Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. The Company has elected to avail itself of this exemption and, therefore, for new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies, the Company will be subject to an extended transition period until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.

from the date of sale. Service contract revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over time consistent with the life of the related service contract in proportion to the costs incurred in fulfilling performance obligations under the service contract. The Company generally does not experience significant returns. As necessary, a provision is recorded for estimated sales returns and allowances and is deducted from gross product revenue to arrive at net product revenue in the period the related revenue is recorded. These estimates are based on historical sales returns and allowances and other known factors. Actual returns and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from these estimates. If actual or expected future returns and claims are significantly greater or lower than the reserves established, a reduction or increase to revenue will be recorded in the period in which such a determination is made. All non-income government-assessed taxes (sales and use taxes) collected from the Company s customers and remitted to governmental agencies are recorded in accrued expenses until they are remitted to the government agency. The Company has adopted the permitting the direct expensing of costs incurred to obtain contracts where the amortization of such costs would occur over one year or less, and it applied to substantially all the Company s contracts.

Warranty accruals are estimated based on the current product costs, the Company s historical experience, management s expectations of future conditions and standard maintenance schedules.

In connection with the transaction, Valsoft agreed to make offers of employment to certain employees of the Business on terms that are comparable to those currently in effect for such employees. The Asset Purchase Agreement contains certain representations, warranties and covenants of each of TDO and Valsoft. Each of TDO and the Valsoft has agreed to indemnify the other for certain losses arising out of breaches of representations and covenants and for certain losses arising out of retained liabilities or assumed liabilities relating to the TDO business, as applicable, subject to customary limitations.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results and timing of selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and in the filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC from time to time . See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. 
 Overview 
 We are a commercial-stage medical technology company focused on saving teeth from tooth decay, the most prevalent chronic disease globally. We have developed and manufacture the GentleWave System, an innovative technology platform designed to treat tooth decay by cleaning and disinfecting the microscopic spaces within teeth without the need to remove tooth structure. The GentleWave System employs a sterilized, single-use procedure instrument PI ), to transform root canal therapy RCT ), by addressing the limitations of conventional methods. 
 The clinical benefits of our GentleWave System when compared to conventional methods of RCT include improved clinical outcomes, such as superior cleaning that is independent of root canal complexity and tooth anatomy, high and rapid rates of healing and minimal to no post- operative pain. In addition to the clinical benefits, the GentleWave System can improve the workflow and economics of dental practices. We began scaling commercialization of our current technology in 2017 and are focused on establishing the GentleWave Procedure as the standard of care for RCT. 
 Our GentleWave System represents an innovative technology platform and approach to RCT. The GentleWave System is a Class II device and has received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for preparing, cleaning, and irrigating teeth indicated for RCT. The key components of our GentleWave System are a sophisticated and mobile console and a pre-packaged, sterilized, single-use PI. The GentleWave System utilizes a proprietary mechanism of action that is designed to combine procedure fluid optimization, broad-spectrum acoustic energy and advanced fluid dynamics to efficiently and effectively reach microscopic spaces within teeth and dissolve and remove tissue and bacteria with minimal or no removal of tooth structure. We have invested significant resources in establishing a broad intellectual property portfolio that protects the GentleWave Procedure and its unique mechanism of action, as well as future capabilities under development. We believe our GentleWave System transforms the patient and dental practitioner experience and addresses many of the limitations of conventional RCT. 
 In the United States and Canada, our direct sales force markets and sells the GentleWave System to dental practitioners performing a high volume of root canals as part of their practice. Our commercial strategy and sales model involves a focus on driving adoption of our GentleWave System by increasing our installed base of consoles and maximizing recurring PI revenue through increased utilization. We have been and expect to continue to expand the size of our sales and clinician support teams to support our efforts of driving adoption and utilization of the GentleWave System. We plan to pursue marketing authorizations and similar certifications to enable marketing and engage in other market access initiatives over time in attractive international regions in which we see significant potential opportunity. 
 As of September 30 , 2024, we maintained an active user base of more than 800 customers. We generated revenue of 23.4 million and incurred a net loss of 27.2 million from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30 , 2024, compared to revenue of 25.6 million and a net loss of 51.2 million for the nine months ended September 30 , 2023. As of September 30 , 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of 17.3 million, an accumulated deficit of 451.7 million, and 17.8 million in principal outstanding under our term loan facility. 
 We expect to continue to incur net losses for the next several years. We expect to continue to make investments in our sales and marketing organization, including potentially expanding our international marketing programs and expanding direct to clinician digital marketing efforts to help facilitate further adoption among existing accounts and to broaden awareness and adoption of our products to new clinicians. We also expect to continue to make investments in research and development, regulatory affairs and clinical studies to develop future generations of our GentleWave products, support regulatory submissions and demonstrate the clinical efficacy of our new products. Moreover, we will continue to incur expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including legal, accounting, insurance, exchange listing and SEC compliance, investor relations, and other administrative and professional services expenses. As a result of these expenses, we require additional financing to fund our operations and planned growth. 
 Our ability to continue as a going concern depends on our ability to successfully secure additional financing, continue to commercialize our products, achieve and maintain profitable operations, as well as the adherence to conditions of outstanding term loans (see Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). Without additional financing, we will have insufficient liquidity to achieve further commercialization of our products and maintain compliance with our loan covenants. There is a material 
 23 

uncertainty that raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and, therefore, that we may be unable to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course of business (see Liquidity and Capital Resources section). 
 Recent Developments 
 Biolase Asset Purchase Agreement 
 On September 30, 2024, we entered into the Biolase Asset Purchase Agreement with the Sellers, pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Biolase Asset Purchase Agreement, we were designated as the stalking horse bidder in connection with a sale of certain assets of Biolase under Section 363 of Title 11 of the United States Code for a total purchase price of (i) 14 million in cash subject to a downward working capital adjustment, (ii) the assumption of liabilities and (iii) the value of the Delaware Litigation. We delivered 10 of the Purchase Price to an escrow agent, which may be returned to us in the event of specified events, including termination of the Biolase Asset Purchase Agreement, subject to certain exceptions relating to a breach of the Biolase Asset Purchase Agreement by us. 
 The Sellers conducted a bankruptcy auction on November 4, 2024. Based on the result of that auction, we were not the winning bidder. Accordingly, we do not expect to proceed with the transaction described in the Biolase Asset Purchase Agreement except in the unlikely event the winning bidder fails to close. Subject to final Bankruptcy Court approval, the Biolase Asset Purchase Agreement will be terminated upon the sale of the Biolase assets to the prevailing bidder, and the Sellers will be required to pay us a break-up fee equal to 3 of the Purchase Price, plus a capped expense reimbursement of up to 575,000 and return amount of the Purchase Price that was placed in escrow at the signing of the Biolase Asset Purchase Agreement. 
 Divestiture of Software Segment 
 On March 1, 2024, we divested our software segment which we owned through TDO Software, Inc. TDO ), our wholly-owned subsidiary, by selling substantially all the assets and liabilities of TDO, our wholly owned subsidiary, for approximately 16.0 million, with 15.0 million received upon closing and the balance due approximately 12 months post-closing. A gain of 5.7 million on sale of the software business was recorded in income from discontinued operations. 
 Stock Listing and Reverse Stock Split 
 Due to our failure to comply with the continued listing standards set forth in the NYSE s Listed Company Manual, our common stock was suspended from trading on the NYSE effective at the opening of business Eastern Standard Time on November 22, 2023. We commenced trading on the OTCQX on the same day. We withdrew our request for an appeal and our common stock was delisted from the NYSE, which may negatively impact our stockholders and the trading price and liquidity of our common stock. On June 4, 2024, we received notice from OTC that our common stock did not meet the Standards for Continued Qualification for the OTCQX per the OTCQX Rules for U.S. Companies section 2.1(A) because our stock s bid price closed below 0.10 for more than 30 consecutive calendar days. We had a cure period of 180 calendar days to regain compliance, which expires December 2, 2024. If our common stock s bid price did not stay at or above the 0.10 minimum for ten consecutive trading days during the cure period, then our common stock would have been moved from OTCQX to the OTC Pink market. 
 On June 10, 2024, our shareholders approved an amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of our issued shares of common stock, at a specific ratio, ranging from 1:10 to 1:200, at the discretion of our board of directors at any time prior to our 2025 annual meeting of stockholders, with the exact ratio to be determined by our board of directors without further approval or authorization of the Company s stockholders. In September 2024, the Board approved a 1-for-200 reverse stock split. 
 On October 16, 2024, we filed an amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to implement a 1-for-200 reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding common stock, which was effected on October 18, 2024. The reverse stock split correspondingly adjusted the per share exercise price of all outstanding options and all shares underlying any of our outstanding warrants by reducing the conversion ratio for each outstanding warrant and increasing the applicable exercise price or conversion price in accordance with the terms of each outstanding warrant and based on the reverse stock split ratio. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the reverse stock split. Stockholders who are entitled to fractional shares will receive a cash payment in lieu of receiving fractional shares (after taking into account and aggregating all shares of our common stock then held by such stockholder) equal to the fractional share interest multiplied by 5.00 (the per share closing price of our common stock, on a post-split basis, as last reported on the OTCQX market on November 7, 2024). The reverse stock split was announced by FINRA on its OTC Daily List on November 7,2024 and took effect at the open of trading on November 8, 2024 on the OTCQX. Upon the effectiveness of the reverse stock split, the Company became compliant with OTCQX Rule 2.1(A). 
 The number of shares of common stock authorized under our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation is unchanged at 500,000,000 shares. The accompanying interim unaudited condensed financial statements reflect the 1-for-200 reverse split of our 
 24 

common stock. All share and per share information data herein that relates to our common stock prior to the effective date has been retroactively restated to reflect the reverse stock split. 
 On November 7, 2024, we received notice from the OTC that our common stock no longer met the Standards for Continued Qualification for the OTCQX per the OTCQX Rules for U.S. Companies section 2.1(B) because our market capitalization has stayed below 5 million for the past 30 consecutive calendar days. We have a cure period of 90 calendar days to regain compliance. The 90-calendar day grace period expires February 7, 2025 and at that time if our market capitalization has not stayed at or above 5 million for ten consecutive trading days then our common stock will be removed from OTCQX and moved to the OTC Pink market. 
 Factors Affecting Our Performance and Key Business Metrics 
 We believe there are several important factors that impact our operating performance and results of operations. We also regularly review several operating and financial metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate our business plan and make strategic decisions. We believe the following factors and key business metrics are important indicators of our performance: 
 Installed base of GentleWave Systems: We have focused on driving adoption of the GentleWave Procedure among endodontists in the United States and Canada. To drive further adoption of our system, we may continue to restructure our team of sales representatives, who are focused on system placement by directly engaging with dental practitioners and educating them about the compelling value proposition of the GentleWave Procedure. Our sales force leverages third-party data of root canal procedure volumes by practitioner, in order to enable us to efficiently and effectively identify target accounts. We believe that our current targeting strategy identifies a well-defined customer base that is accessible by our direct sales organization. 

System utilization: Our revenue is significantly impacted by the utilization of our GentleWave System. Our objective is to establish the GentleWave Procedure as the standard of care for RCT. We intend to increase awareness of the GentleWave Procedure among dental practitioners and, in select markets where we establish a large installed base, directly with patients through various targeted direct-to-patient marketing initiatives, showcasing the benefits and points of difference of the GentleWave Procedure. We believe that once patients become aware of the GentleWave Procedure, they will seek the GentleWave Procedure over conventional RCT. We believe these initiatives will drive a greater volume of root canal procedures to dental practitioners who offer the GentleWave Procedure, thereby increasing utilization of our system. 

Gross margins: Our results of operations depend, in part, on our ability to increase our gross margins by more effectively managing our costs to produce our GentleWave Console and single-use PI, and to scale our manufacturing operations efficiently. We are undertaking continuous cost saving programs, including implementation of lean manufacturing methods and working with our suppliers to reduce material costs. CleanFlow PI is now our leading PI and we have phased out the legacy PI and accessories designed for molar teeth (a Molar PI and anteriors and premolars (an APM PI in 2024. CleanFlow PI has a lower cost to manufacture on per unit basis compared to the legacy Molar PI and APM PI. We anticipate that the combination of these strategies will continue driving gross margin improvement. 

Commercial organization: As of September 30 , 2024, our sales and customer support team consisted of approximately 45 employees. We intend to continue to re-prioritize our commercial organization to increase the adoption of our products among existing and new customer accounts. Successfully recruiting and training a sufficient number of sales and customer support employees is required to achieve growth at the rate we expect. The effectiveness of our commercial organization re-prioritization can impact our revenue growth and our costs incurred in anticipation of such growth. 

Effects of the Macroeconomic Environment 
 Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the nine months ended September 30 , 2024 reflect our estimate of the impact of the macroeconomic environment, including the impact of inflation and higher interest rates. The duration and scope of these conditions cannot be predicted; therefore, the extent to which these conditions will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations and financial condition, is uncertain. We are not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require an update to our estimates, judgments and assumptions or a revision of the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of this filing. 
 Components of Our Results of Operations 
 As discussed in Note 3, Discontinued Operations to the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q , o n March 1, 2024, we divested our software segment by selling substantially all assets and liabilities of TDO. The sale met the criteria to be accounted for as a discontinued operation as required by Accounting Standards Codification ASC 205-20. Accordingly, the financial results of the software business are reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying unaudited Condensed C onsolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for all periods presented. Our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows include the financial results of the software business for the nine months ended September 30 , 2024 and 2023. 
 25 

Revenue 
 Our revenue from continuing operations consists primarily of product and service revenue. We generate product revenue on the capital sale of our GentleWave Console and recurring sales of our single-use PIs and accessories. To a lesser extent, we also derive revenue from service and repair and extended warranty contracts with our existing customers. We expect our product and service revenue to increase in absolute dollars as we increase adoption and utilization of our GentleWave System, though revenues may fluctuate from quarter to quarter. We also expect the growth of recurring sales of our single-use PI and accessories to outpace the growth of capital sales of our GentleWave Console. Prior period financial statements have been recast so that software revenue is included in the discontinued operations. 
 Cost of Sales and Gross Margin 
 Cost of sales from continuing operations consists primarily of manufacturing overhead costs, material costs, and direct labor to produce our products, warranty, provisions for slow-moving and obsolete inventory, and other direct costs such as shipping and software support. A significant portion of our cost of sales currently consists of manufacturing overhead costs. These overhead costs include personnel compensation, including stock-based compensation expenses, facilities, production equipment depreciation, operations supervision, quality control, material procurement, intangible assets amortization and impairment of long-lived assets. We provide a one-year warranty on capital equipment upon initial sale, and we establish a reserve for warranty repairs based on historical warranty repair costs incurred. Provisions for warranty obligations, which are included in cost of sales, are provided for at the time of shipment. We expect our cost of sales to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future primarily as, and to the extent, our revenue grows, partially offset by lower unit product manufacturing and warranty costs, though it may fluctuate from period to period. Prior period financial statements have been recast so that software cost of sales is included in the discontinued operations. 
 We calculate gross margin as gross profit divided by revenue. Our gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, primarily, product mix and the resulting average selling prices, production volumes, manufacturing costs and product yields, and the implementation of cost reduction strategies. Our previous software segment gross margin is generally higher than our product gross margin. Prior period financial statements have been recast to exclude the software segment from continuing operations. We expect gross margin to fluctuate in the short term and to increase year over year. We are engaged in various efforts to improve our gross margin by reducing unit product costs to the extent our production volumes increase, as well as through product design improvements, reducing material costs through negotiations with suppliers and optimizing the manufacturing process and reducing the costs to service our installed base. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Selling and Marketing 
 Selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel compensation, including stock-based compensation, related to selling, marketing, and professional education functions. Selling and marketing expenses also include commissions, training, travel expenses, promotional activities, conferences, trade shows, and professional services fees. We expect our selling and marketing expenses to decrease in absolute dollars compared to the prior year periods for the remainder of 2024 and in 2025 based on the benefits derived from recently adopted cost saving measures and additional measures we expect to adopt in the future, including reductions in headcount and the reprioritization of our commercial infrastructure, and lower spending on sales and marketing programs and initiatives, though it may fluctuate from period to period. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel compensation, including stock-based compensation, related to administration, finance, information technology, legal, and human resource functions. SG A expenses also include travel expenses, professional services fees, audit fees, legal fees, insurance costs and general corporate expenses including allocated facilities-related expenses. We expect our G A expenses to decrease in absolute dollars compared to the prior year periods for the remainder of 2024 and in 2025 based on the benefits derived from recently adopted cost saving measures and additional measures we expect to adopt in the future, including reductions in headcount and lower spending on general and administrative programs, though it may fluctuate from period to period. 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development R D expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for proprietary R D programs, and include costs of product engineering, product development, regulatory affairs, consulting services, materials, and depreciation, as well as other costs associated with products and technologies being developed. These expenses include employee and non-employee compensation, including stock-based compensation, supplies, materials, consulting, related travel expenses and facilities expenses. We expect our R D expenses to decrease in absolute dollars compared to the prior year periods for the remainder of 2024 and in 2025 based on the benefits derived from recently adopted cost saving measures and additional measures we expect to adopt in the future as we become more efficient in our efforts to develop, enhance, and commercialize new products and technologies. However, we expect our R D 
 26 

expenses as a percentage of revenue to vary over time depending on the level and timing of initiating new product development efforts. 
 Interest and Other Expense 
 Interest and other expense consists primarily of interest expe nse under our outstanding term loan and interest income from investments in marketable securities. 
 Income from Discontinued Operations 
 Income from discontinued operations consists primarily of income (loss) from TDO s software business and gain from sale of TDO s assets and liabilities.

Revenue 
 Revenue from continuing operations decreased 0.1 million, or 2 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from the comparable period in the prior year, which was primarily driven by lower average selling price in GentleWave consoles, partially offset by an increase in extended service contracts revenue. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we generated 1.9 million and 5.1 million fro m the sale of GentleWave consoles and PIs, respectively, compared to 2.1 million and 5.1 million respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Revenue from continuing operations decreased 2.2 million, or 9 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the comparable period in the prior year, which was driven by lower sales volumes in PIs and lower average selling price in GentleWave consoles, partially offset by an increase in extended service contract revenue. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated 6.1 million and 14.0 million fro m the sale of GentleWave consoles and PIs, respectively, compared to 6.3 million and 16.4 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Cost of sales and Gross margin 
 Cost of sales decreased 2.6 million, or 35 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period, which was primarily driven by lower manufacturing costs for PIs, as well as a 1.3 million charge due to impairment of long-lived assets recorded in prior year period. 
 Cost of sales decreased 8.3 million, or 36 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period, which was primarily driven by lower manufacturing costs for PIs and GentleWave consoles and lower excess and obsolete inventory charges. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 0.3 million of excess and obsolete inventory charges related to phasing out our legacy GentleWave Console Gen3 and our legacy molar and anterior pre-molar procedure instruments. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded 2.9 million of excess and obsolete inventory charges due to reduced sales volumes of our Gen3 and the phasing out of our legacy molar and anterior pre-molar procedure instruments, as well as a 1.3 million charge due to impairment of long-lived assets. 
 Due to the aforementioned decrease in cost of sales, gross margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 30 and 27 compared to the prior year period, respectively. 
 Selling and marketing expenses 
 Selling and marketing expenses decreased 3.3 million, or 48 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily driven by an approximately 2.0 million decrease in employee-related compensation and benefit expenses, including stock-based compensation as a result of the reduction in headcount. The decrease was also attributed lower marketing spending as we re-prioritize our commercial organization to increase the adoption of our products among existing and new customer accounts. 
 Selling and marketing expenses decreased 9.8 million, or 43 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily driven by an approximately 5.7 million decrease in employee-related compensation and benefit expenses, including stock-based compensation, as a result of the previously disclosed reduction in headcount. The decrease was also attributed lower marketing spending as we re-prioritize our commercial organization to increase the adoption of our products among existing and new customer accounts. The decrease is partially offset by expenses of 0.6 million recognized relating to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock units RSUs granted to certain non-executive employees in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 General and administrative expenses 
 General and administrative expenses decreased 2.8 million, or 37 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily driven by decrease in employee-related compensation and benefit expenses, including stock-based compensation and recruiting expenses, as a result of the reduction in headcount. The decrease was also driven by an impairment charge of 1.8 million for long-lived assets recorded in the prior year period. This decrease was partially offset by the transaction and financing expenses of 0.9 million related to the Biolase acquisition incurred in the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 General and administrative expenses decreased 6.3 million, or 31 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily driven by decrease in employee-related compensation and expenses, including stock-based compensation, recruiting, travel and office expenses, as a result of the reduction in headcount. The decrease was also driven by an impairment charge of 1.8 million for long-lived assets recorded in the prior year period. This decrease was partially offset by the transaction and financing expenses of 0.9 million related to the Biolase acquisition and the expenses of 0.2 million recognized relating to the accelerated vesting of RSUs granted to certain non-executive employees in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 28 

Research and development expenses 
 R D expenses decreased 1.2 million, or 43 , and 3.1 million, or 37 , respectively, f or the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the comparable period in the prior year , primarily driven by a decrease in employee related compensation and benefit expenses due to lower headcount. The decrease for the nine months period is partially offset by expenses of 0.4 million recognized relating to the accelerated vesting of RSUs granted to certain non-executive employees in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Interest and other expense 
 Interest and other expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 0.1 million, or 16 , from the comparable period in the prior year, mainly due to a 0.5 million decrease in interest income resulting from lower amounts of short-term investments, offset by lower interest expense resulting from principal repayments on our term loan. 
 Interest and other expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 1.2 million, or 56 , from the comparable period in the prior year, mainly due to 1.4 million of expense for accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs resulting from the principal prepayment on our term loan in March 2024. 
 Income from Discontinued Operations 
 Income from discontinued operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consists primarily of gain of 5.7 million from sale of TDO s assets and liabilities and loss from TDO s software business for the period from January 1, 2024 to March 1, 2024, which includes expenses of 0.3 million recognized relating to the accelerated vesting of RSUs granted to certain non-executive employees. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of liquidity 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of 17.3 million, an accumulated deficit of 451.7 million, and 17.8 million in principal outstanding under our term loan facility. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our net losses from continuing operations were 27.2 million and 51.2 million, respectively, and our net cash used in operating activities was 21.7 million and 36.6 million, respectively. 
 Funding requirements 
 We have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception, and we anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the next several years. 
 We expect our operating expenses from continuing operations to continue to decrease compared to the prior year period for the remainder of 2024 and in 2025 based on the benefits derived from recently adopted cost saving measures and additional measures we expect to adopt in the future, including reductions in headcount and the reprioritization of our commercial infrastructure, and lower spending on selling, marketing, R D and general and administrative programs and functions, though it may fluctuate from period to period. The timing and amount of our operating expenditures will depend on many factors, including: 
 the degree and rate of market acceptance of our current and future products and the GentleWave Procedure; 

the scope and timing of investment in our sales force; 

the cost of our research and development activities; 

the cost and timing of additional regulatory clearances or approvals; 

the costs associated with any product recall that may occur; 

the costs associated with the manufacturing of our products at increased production levels; 

the costs of attaining, defending and enforcing our intellectual property rights; 

the terms and timing of any other collaborative, licensing and other arrangements that we may establish; 

the scope, rate of progress and cost of our current or future clinical trials and registries; 

the emergence of competing new products, technologies or alternative treatments or other adverse market developments; 

our ability to raise additional funds to finance our operations; 

debt service requirements; 

the costs associated with being a public company; and 

the impact of the macroeconomic environment, including as a result of inflation and rising interest rates, the war in Ukraine and the Gaza strip, or any other pandemic, epidemic or infectious disease outbreak, on our business. 

Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report have been prepared assuming we will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities in the normal 
 29 

course of business, and do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from uncertainty related to our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 Our ability to continue as a going concern depends on our ability to continue to commercialize our products, achieve and maintain profitable operations, as well as the adherence to conditions of the outstanding term loan (see Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). Without additional financing, we will have insufficient liquidity to achieve further commercialization of our products and maintain compliance with our loan covenants. Due to these conditions, there is a material uncertainty that raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and, therefore, we may be unable to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course of business. 
 We will require additional financing in order to fund future expected negative cash flows. Due to our failure to comply with the continued listing standards set forth in the NYSE s Listed Company Manual, our common stock was suspended from trading on the NYSE effective at the opening of business Eastern Standard Time on November 22, 2023. We commenced trading on the OTCQX on the same day. In April 2024, we withdrew the request to appeal the NYSE s delisting determination and our common stock was delisted from the NYSE, which may negatively impact our stockholders and the trading price and liquidity of our common stock. 
 On June 4, 2024, we received notice from OTC that our common stock did not meet the Standards for Continued Qualification for the OTCQX per the OTCQX Rules for U.S. Companies section 2.1 because our stock s bid price closed below 0.10 for more than 30 consecutive calendar days. We had a cure period of 180 calendar days to regain compliance, which expires December 2, 2024. If our common stock s bid price did not stay at or above the 0.10 minimum for ten consecutive trading days during the cure period, then our common stock would have been moved from OTCQX to the OTC Pink market. 
 On June 10, 2024, our shareholders approved an amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of the Company s issued shares of common stock, at a specific ratio, ranging from 1:10 to 1:200, at the discretion of our board of directors at any time prior to the 2025 annual meeting of stockholders, with the exact ratio to be determined by our board of directors without further approval or authorization of our stockholders. 
 On October 16, 2024, we filed an amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to implement a 1-for-200 reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding common stock. The reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock was effected at a ratio of 1 post-split share for every 200 pre-split shares as of 12:01a.m. Eastern Time on October 18, 2024. The reverse stock split correspondingly adjusted the per share exercise price of all outstanding options and all shares underlying any of our outstanding warrants by reducing the conversion ratio for each outstanding warrant and increasing the applicable exercise price or conversion price in accordance with the terms of each outstanding warrant and based on the reverse stock split ratio. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the reverse stock split. Stockholders who are entitled to fractional shares will receive a cash payment in lieu of receiving fractional shares (after taking into account and aggregating all shares of our common stock then held by such stockholder) equal to the fractional share interest multiplied by 5.00 (the per share closing price of our common stock, on a post-split basis, as last reported on the OTCQX market on November 7, 2024). The reverse stock split was announced by FINRA on its OTC Daily List on November 7,2024 and took effect at the open of trading on November 8, 2024 on the OTCQX. Upon the effectiveness of the reverse stock split, the Company became compliant with OTCQX Rule 2.1(A). 
 The number of shares of common stock authorized under our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation is unchanged at 500,000,000 shares. The accompanying interim unaudited condensed financial statements reflect the 1-for-200 reverse split of our common stock. All share and per share information data herein that relates to our common stock prior to the effective date has been retroactively restated to reflect the reverse stock split. 
 On November 7, 2024, we received notice from the OTC that our common stock no longer met the Standards for Continued Qualification for the OTCQX per the OTCQX Rules for U.S. Companies section 2.1(B) because our market capitalization has stayed below 5 million for the past 30 consecutive calendar days. We have a cure period of 90 calendar days to regain compliance. The 90-calendar day grace period expires February 7, 2025 and at that time if our market capitalization has not stayed at or above 5 million for ten consecutive trading days then our common stock will be removed from OTCQX and moved to the OTC Pink market. 
 Over-the-counter markets are more limited than the NYSE, and it is likely that there will be significantly less liquidity in the trading of our common stock. The delisting of our common stock from the NYSE, and the potential move from the OTCQX to the OTC Pink market, could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations due to, among other things: 
 reduced trading liquidity and market prices for our common and preferred stock 

decreased number of institutional and other investors willing to hold or acquire our stock, coverage by securities analysts, market making activity and information available concerning trading prices and volume, as well as fewer broker-dealers willing to execute trades in our stock, thereby further restricting our ability to obtain equity financing 

resulting event of default or noncompliance under certain of our debt facilities and other agreements and 

reduced ability to retain, attract and motivate our directors, officers and employees by means of equity compensation. 

30 

Delisting our common stock from the NYSE, and the potential move from the OTCQX to the OTC Pink market, may adversely impact our liquidity, impair our stockholders ability to buy and sell our common stock, impair our ability to raise capital, and the market price of our common stock could decrease. Delisting our common stock or potential move from the OTCQX to the OTC Pink market could also adversely impact the perception of our financial condition and have additional negative ramifications, including further loss of confidence by our employees, the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business opportunities. 
 We have active plans to mitigate these conditions, including plans to further reduce negative cash flow through additional operating expense reductions. We are also actively exploring financing options, including a combination of debt, equity, and non-dilutive sources. Additionally, as detailed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we closed on the sale of TDO in March 2024, and renegotiated our covenant requirements with our lender, among other terms, which resulted in us remitting 15 million of principal payments on our outstanding borrowings. Our plans are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties and there can be no assurance that our plans can be effectively implemented and, therefore, that the conditions can be effectively mitigated. 
 Indebtedness 
 On January 13, 2023, we entered into the Amendment No. 2 (the Second Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and Guaranty by and among us, Pipstek, LLC, as the Subsidiary Guarantor, and Perceptive Credit Holdings III, LP, as the Collateral Agent and the Required Lender (the Amended Perceptive Loan Agreement )to replace the existing benchmark rate from the one-month LIBOR with a one-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ). All other terms remain unchanged on the original agreement. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the interest rate for amounts borrowed under the Amended Perceptive Loan Agreement was the greater of the one-month SOFR and 2.00 plus the applicable margin of 9.25 . 
 On March 1, 2024, we entered to the Amendment No. 3 to the Amended Perceptive Loan Agreement (the Third Amendment ). Pursuant to the Third Amendment, we made a one-time 15.0 million principal repayment on March 1, 2024, and made an amortization payment of 1.8 million on the outstanding principal on March 31, 2024 and we agreed to make monthly amortization payments on the outstanding principal amount each in the amount of 0.9 million on each payment date commencing on April 30, 2024. Accordingly, 1.0 million of the unamortized debt issuance costs were expensed. 
 For the nine months ended September 30 , 2024 and 2023, the effective interest rate of the loan pursuant to the Amended Perceptive Loan Agreement, was 21.22 and 16.71 , respectively. As of September 30 , 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the loan pursuant to the Amended Perceptive Loan Agreement approximates its carrying amount. 
 The Third Amendment also modified certain covenants included in the Amended Perceptive Loan Agreement and released all liens granted to the TDO s software assets. Future principal repayments and the net carrying value of the Perceptive Loan, as of September 30, 2024, are as follows:

We are permitted to make voluntary prepayments, subject to a scaled prepayment premium that ranges from 7.0 to 1.0 of the aggregate principal amount outstanding on such prepayment date for prepayments made after August 23, 2022 and before August 23, 2025. No prepayment premium is required for payments made after August 23, 2025. 
 The Amended Perceptive Loan Agreement contains events of default, including, without limitation, upon: (i) failure to make a payment pursuant to the terms of the agreement; (ii) violation of certain covenants; (iii) payment or other defaults on other indebtedness; (iv) material adverse change in the business or change in control; (v) insolvency; (vi) significant judgments; (vii) incorrectness of representations and warranties; (viii) regulatory matters; and (ix) failure by us to maintain a valid and perfected lien on the collateral securing the borrowing. Based on the Amended Perceptive Loan Agreement, we have granted a security interest in substantially all of our assets. 
 The Amended Perceptive Loan Agreement includes financial covenants that require us to (i) maintain, at all times, a minimum aggregate balance of 3.0 million in cash in one or more controlled accounts, and (ii) pursuant to the Third Amendment, satisfy certain minimum revenue thresholds, measured for the consecutive 12-month periods ending on each calendar quarter-end until June 30, 2026 as follows:

Pursuant to the Third Amendment, the lender also waived the covenant requiring the absence of any going concern or like qualification or exception or any qualification or exception as to the scope of the audit, solely with respect to the fiscal year ending on December 31, 2023. 
 Failure to satisfy any covenants would constitute an event of default under the Amended Perceptive Loan Agreement. In the event of an event of default, the lender may terminate its commitments and declare all amounts outstanding under the Amended Perceptive Loan Agreement immediately due and payable, together with accrued interest and all fees and other obligations. The amount of such repayment will include payment of any prepayment premium applicable due to the time of such payment. In addition, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any event of default, the applicable margin will increase by 3.00 per annum to 12.25 . 
 Revenue generated from continuing and discontinued operations for the 12-months period ended September 30 , 2024 was 36.5 million, and the cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balance was 17.3 million as of September 30 , 2024. As such, we were in compliance with all financial covenants and conditions under the agreement as of September 30 , 2024.

Non-cash items primarily consisted of 4.2 million in stock-based compensation and 1.7 million of amortization of debt issuance costs. Changes in our net operating assets and liabilities year-over-year, was primarily due to a 1.2 million increase inventory, 2.1 million decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities on payments to vendors and a 0.7 million decrease in accrued compensation due to 2023 year-end bonus payout, partially offset by changes in accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets and accounts payable attributable to timing of payment.

Non-cash items primarily consisted of 5.8 million in stock-based compensation, 3.4 million impairment of long-lived assets and 3.0 million in depreciation and amortization. Changes in our net operating assets and liabilities year-over-year, were primarily due to a 4.4 million cash receipts of ERC refund and a 4.1 million decrease in inventory due to managing production level, partially offset by increase in accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, accrued compensation and accounts payable attributable to timing of payment.

 Net cash used in financing activities was 22.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to principal repayments on our term loan. Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was immaterial. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements, the revenue generated, and expenses incurred, and related disclosures, during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and any such differences may be material. 
 There were no material changes to our critical accounting policies or in the methodology used for estimates from those described in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 11, 2024. 
 JOBS Act Accounting Election and Smaller Reporting Company Status 
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible for exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, presenting only two years of audited financial statements in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements with correspondingly reduced Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations disclosure in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation, and an exemption from the requirements to obtain a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements. We have elected to take advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and may elect to take advantage of other reduced reporting requirements in our future filings with the SEC. As a result, the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different than you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests. 
 In addition, the JOBS Act permits an emerging growth company such as us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption and, therefore, for new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies, we may delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies . 
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (1) the last day of our first fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of our IPO, which closed on November 2, 2021, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenues of at least 1.235 billion or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the end of the second quarter of the prior fiscal year, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period . 
 We are also a smaller reporting company as defined in the Exchange Act. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company. We may take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies and will be able to take advantage of these scaled disclosures for so long as our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than 250 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter, or our annual revenue is less than 100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter .

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Not applicable. 
 Item 4. Controls a nd Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 
 Control systems, no matter how well conceived and operated, are designed to provide a reasonable, but not an absolute, level of assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Because of the inherent limitations in any control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

PART II OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Ite m 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 From time to time, we may become involved in various claims and legal proceedings, including those related to compliance with California wage and hour laws and derivative matters. Management presently believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our financial position, cash flow, or overall trends in results of operations. Additionally, we maintain insurance policies that may cover certain of these claims. However, legal proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings or outcomes could occur that have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. In addition, regardless of out come, litigation and other legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. 
 On October 1, 2024, we and PIPStek, LLC PIPStek ), our wholly-owned subsidiary, filed a proof of claim with the Bankruptcy Court for a total of not less than 59,000,000 in damages related to alleged infringement by Biolase of certain of our and PIPStek s patents covering the use of laser systems and radial firing tips. Biolase s infringement includes the claims asserted in the litigation styled PIPStek, LLC v. Biolase, Inc.; C.A. No. 1:23-cv-00011-JPM pending in the District Court of the District of Delaware (the Delaware Litigation ). There can be no assurance that PIPStek will be successful in the Delaware Litigation, and any recovery on such claims will also depend part on the outcome of the Biolase Chapter 11 case before the Bankruptcy Court and the recovery to holders of unsecured claims generally. 
 Ite m 1A. Risk Factors. 
 We have described under the heading Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results of operations and financial condition to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, results of operations and financial condition. These risks and uncertainties are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or the market price of our common stock. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors previously described in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Our securities trade on the OTCQX, which could affect our securities market price and liquidity. 
 On November 22, 2023, the NYSE suspended trading of our common stock and announced its intention to commence proceedings to delist our common stock from the NYSE and our common stock commenced trading on the OTCQX on the same day. We appealed the NYSE s delisting determination, but subsequently withdrew our request for an appeal on April 11, 2024. As a result, on April 11, 2024, our common stock was delisted from the NYSE. 
 On June 4, 2024, we were notified by the OTC, that our common stock closed below 0.10 for more than 30 consecutive calendar days and no longer meets the Standards for Continued Qualification for the OTCQX, Rule 2.1(A). On October 16, 2024, we filed an amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to implement a 1-for-200 reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding common stock, effective as of October 18, 2024. The reverse stock split was announced by FINRA on its OTC Daily List on November 7,2024 and took effect at the open of trading on November 8, 2024 on the OTCQX. Upon the effectiveness of the reverse stock split, the Company became compliant with OTCQX Rule 2.1(A). 
 On November 7, 2024, we were notified by the OTC, that market capitalization has stayed below 5 million for the past 30 consecutive calendar days and no longer meets the Standards for Continued Qualification for the OTCQX, Rule 2.1(B). We have a cure period of 90 calendar days to regain compliance. The 90-calendar day grace period expires February 7, 2025 and at that time if our market capitalization has not stayed at or above 5 million for ten consecutive trading days then our common stock will be removed from OTCQX and moved to the OTC Pink market. 
 We intend to monitor our market capitalization and consider our available options to resolve the noncompliance with the market capitalization requirement. There can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance with the market capitalization requirement or will otherwise be in compliance with other OTCQX listing criteria. If our common stock is moved to OTC Pink market, it could be more difficult to buy or sell our common stock and to obtain accurate quotations, and the price of our common stock could suffer a material decline. The move to OTC Pink market could also impair the liquidity of our common stock and could harm our ability to raise capital through alternative financing sources on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and may result in potential loss of confidence by investors, employees, and fewer business development opportunities. 
 While we are evaluating possible alternatives in light of the NYSE delisting and OTC noncompliance notice, including applying to list our common stock under an alternative national securities exchange, we cannot assure you that we will be able to demonstrate compliance required for such listing. We will be required to demonstrate compliance with an applicable exchange s initial listing requirements, which are generally more rigorous than an exchange s continued listing requirements, in order to qualify for listing our securities. 
 35 

Additionally, we could face significant material adverse consequences from trading on the OTC platform (as compared to our prior listing on NYSE), including: 
 a limited availability of market quotations for our common stock; 

reduced liquidity for our common stock, including reduced availability of buyers or sellers of our common stock; 

thin with sporadic fluctuations in price; 

greater volatility and lower trading volumes; 

depression the trading price of our common stock and make it more difficult to purchase, dispose of or obtain accurate quotations; 

a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and 

a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. 

The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as covered securities. Our common stock no longer qualify as covered securities under such statute, due to the delisting from the NYSE. We are therefore subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our common stock, which may negatively impact our ability to consummate any future offering of our common stock. 
 In addition, our common stock may be defined as a penny stock under Rule 3a51-1 under the Exchange Act. Penny stocks are subject to Rule 15g-9, which imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell low-priced securities to persons other than established customers and institutional accredited investors. For transactions covered by this rule, a broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser s written consent to the transaction prior to sale. Consequently, the rule may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our common stock and affect the ability of holders to sell our common stock in the secondary market. To the extent our common stock is subject to the penny stock regulations, the market liquidity for our common stock will be adversely affected. 
 The effect of our reverse stock split on the market price and trading of our common stock cannot be predicted with any certainty. 
 Although we believe that a higher market price of our common stock may help generate greater or broader investor interest, there can be no assurance that our reverse stock split will result in a share price that will attract new investors, including institutional investors. In addition, there can be no assurance that the market price of our common stock will satisfy the investing requirements of those investors. As a result, the trading liquidity of our common stock may not necessarily improve. 
 The decline in the per share price of our common stock and the decline in our overall market capitalization may be greater following the reverse stock split than would have occurred in the absence of a reverse stock split. Any reduction in our market capitalization may be magnified as a result of the smaller number of total shares of common stock outstanding following the reverse stock split. 
 Furthermore, even if the reverse stock split does result in an increased market price per share of our common stock, the market price per share following the reverse stock split may not increase in proportion to the reduction of the number of shares of our common stock outstanding before the implementation of the reverse stock split. Accordingly, even with an increased market price per share, the total market capitalization of shares of our common stock after a reverse stock split could be lower than the total market capitalization before the reverse stock split. Also, even if there is an initial increase in the market price per share of our common stock after a reverse stock split, the market price may not remain at that level. 
 The sale of securities by us in any equity or debt financing could result in dilution to our existing stockholders. 
 Any sale of common stock by us in a future private placement offering could result in dilution to the existing stockholders as a direct result of our issuance of additional shares of our capital stock. In addition, our business strategy may include expansion through internal growth by acquiring complementary businesses, acquiring, or establishing strategic relationships with targeted customers and suppliers. In order to do so, or to finance the cost of our other activities, we may issue additional equity securities that could dilute our stockholders stock ownership. We may also assume additional debt and incur impairment losses related to goodwill and other tangible assets, and this could negatively impact our earnings and results of operations. 
 We may require additional capital to support growth, and such capital might not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. This could hamper our growth and adversely affect our business. 
 We intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to enhance our products and services, improve our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in public or private equity, equity-linked or debt financing to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing that we secure in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, including the ability to pay dividends. This may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. We may 
 36 

not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired, and our business could be adversely affected. 
 Litigation and other legal proceedings may adversely affect our business. 
 From time-to-time we may become involved in legal proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property matters, product liability claims, employee claims, tort or contract claims, federal regulatory investigations, securities class action and other legal proceedings or investigations, which could have an adverse impact on our reputation, business and financial condition and divert the attention of our management from the operation of our business. For example, on January 22, 2024, a former employee, whose position was eliminated in a reduction-in-force, filed a complaint against us alleging various violations of California wage and hour laws, including unpaid meal and rest period premiums. While at this time we believe that a loss is not probable, including due to our affirmative defenses, litigation is inherently unpredictable and can result in excessive or unanticipated verdicts and/or injunctive relief that affect how we operate our business. We could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages or for agreements to change the way we operate our business, or both. There may be an increase in the scope of these matters or there may be additional lawsuits, claims, proceedings or investigations in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us could damage our reputation and brand image, undermine clinicians confidence and reduce long-term demand for our GentleWave System, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations. 
 
 In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because medical technology companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. If we face such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources, which could harm our business.
