ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Office Lease did not provide an explicit rate of interest; therefore we used an estimated incremental borrowing rate of based on a fully collateralized and fully amortizing loan with a maturity date of the same length as the lease that is based on information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.

 million and million, compared to the principal balance (excluding debt discount) of million and million, respectively. The fair value of loans payable was estimated using lending rates available to us for financial instruments with similar terms and maturities. The fair value of our fixed and variable rate loans payable was estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities. As the inputs to our valuation estimate are neither observable in nor supported by market activity, our loans payable are classified as Level 3 liability within the fair value hierarchy. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we believe the carrying amounts of our variable rate loans payable are reasonably estimated at their carrying amounts as there have been minimal changes to the fixed spread portion of interest rates for similar loans observed in the market, and as the variable portion of our interest rates fluctuate with the associated market indices. We believe the fair value of our variable rate mezzanine loan payable, which is currently in default, approximates the carrying amount based on the contractual rights of the mezzanine loan payable holders.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report. This section contains forward-looking statements, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words believes, project, expects, anticipates, estimates, intends, strategy, plan, may, will, would, will be, will continue, will likely result, and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements that were true at the time made may ultimately prove to be incorrect or false. We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All forward-looking statements should be read in light of the risks identified in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC April 16, 2024. Overview As of September 30, 2024, our ownership interests in our 15 real estate properties of senior housing facilities was as follows: 100 ownership of 11 properties (eight of which were derecognized in March 2024 and are included in contract assets (see Note 14 to the accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements)), and a 95.3 interest in four properties in a consolidated joint venture, Cornerstone Healthcare Partners LLC. We also have three unconsolidated equity-method investments (collectively, our Equity-Method Investments with interests ranging from 10 - 20 that hold an aggregate of 21 properties. As used in this report, the Company, we, us and our refer to Summit Healthcare REIT, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, except where the context otherwise requires. Our revenues are comprised largely of tenant rental income from our real estate properties, including rents reported on a straight-line basis over the initial term of each tenant lease, resident fees and services and asset management fees resulting from our Equity-Method Investments. We also receive cash distributions from our Equity-Method Investments, which are included in net cash provided by operating activities and net cash provided by investing activities in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. Our growth depends, in part, on our ability to continue to raise joint venture equity or other equity, acquire new healthcare properties at attractive prices, negotiate long-term tenant leases with sustainable rental rate escalation terms and control our expenses. Our operations are impacted by property-specific, market-specific, general economic, regulatory and other conditions. We believe that continued investing in senior housing facilities is accretive to earnings and stockholder value. Senior housing facilities include independent living facilities IL ), skilled nursing facilities SNF ), assisted living facilities AL ), memory care facilities MC and continuing care retirement communities CCRC ). Each of these types of facilities focuses on different segments of the senior population.Our current properties are SNF, AL, and MC facilities. Current Market and Economic Conditions The U.S. economy is experiencing a mixed but stable environment currently. The Federal Reserve has started cutting interest rates in response to cooling inflation and a softer job market. More rate cuts are expected and economic conditions are moderating, but risks remain. Geopolitical tensions and other headwinds could impact inflation and growth moving forward. More specifically, the seniors housing and care real estate market continues to be significantly impacted. Higher interest rates and inflation have increased operational costs for seniors housing facilities, particularly as providers face mounting staffing shortages, wage pressures, and new regulations that mandate minimum staffing levels. The prolonged period of high and persistent inflation has caused an increase in our expenses. These economic conditions have had a material impact on our business, cash flow and results of operations. They could also impact our ability to find suitable acquisitions, sell properties, and raise equity and debt capital. Summit Portfolio Properties At September 30, 2024, our portfolio consisted of 15 real estate properties as noted above in the Overview section of this Item 2, 13 of which were 100 triple-net leased to the tenants of the related facilities. The other two properties are each 100 leased to an affiliated subsidiary for which we operate directly and earn resident fees and services revenue.

 GA8 Properties On March 13, 2024, we received a notice of default from Oxford Finance, LLC Oxford ), dated March 12, 2024, for events of default under the mezzanine loan for Summit Georgia Holdings LLC, the sole member of the GA8 Properties, whereby Oxford exercised certain rights as the agent, including, their right to act as attorney-in-fact of Summit Georgia Holdings LLC, and appointed an independent manager over the GA8 Properties, thereby removing Summit as the manager and removing the voting rights and rights to receive any distributions with respect to such properties. As such, the independent manager now has control over all activities of the GA8 Properties and Summit no longer has any control or authority over the properties operations or activities. As a result of these actions, Summit derecognized the operating assets and liabilities associated with the GA8 Properties as of March 12, 2024. As a result of these actions, Summit recorded, as of September 30, 2024, a contract asset of approximately 130.9 million, which represents the liabilities we expect to be released from upon final resolution with the lender, and is included in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet in contract assets associated with GA8 Properties. The loans payable of 122.3 million is included in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 in loans payable associated with GA8 Properties, and accrued interest of approximately 8.6 million related to GA8 Properties is included in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 in accrued interest associated with GA8 Properties. Summit Equity-Method Investment Portfolio Properties We continue to believe that raising institutional capital to make acquisitions will be accretive to shareholder value. Our primary source of capital since 2015 has been institutional funds raised through a joint venture structure and accounted for as equity-method investments. We still believe this is a prudent strategy for growth; however, in the future, we may raise additional equity capital through alternative methods if warranted by market conditions. Summit Union Life Holdings, LLC In April 2015, through our operating partnership Operating Partnership ), we formed Summit Union Life Holdings, LLC SUL JV with Best Years, LLC Best Years ), an unrelated entity and a U.S.-based affiliate of Union Life Insurance Co, Ltd. (a Chinese corporation), and entered into a limited liability company with Best Years with respect to the SUL JV (the SUL LLC Agreement ). We have a 10 interest in the SUL JV which owns 13 properties. The SUL JV is not consolidated in our condensed consolidated financial statements and is accounted for under the equity-method in our condensed consolidated financial statements. In March 2024, the SUL JV sold one of the properties for a total gain of approximately 7.8 million. We received approximately 1.9 million in cash in April 2024 from the capital proceeds of the sale (of which approximately 0.1 million was our 10 accrued but unpaid return plus our total contribution and approximately 1.8 million was 25 of the remaining proceeds as due to us per the SUL LLC Agreement). In May 2024, the SUL JV sold one of the properties for a total gain of approximately 0.9 million and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded our 10 of the gain on the sales of approximately 0.1 million. As of September 30, 2024, the balance of our equity-method investment related to the SUL JV was approximately 0.6 million. Equity-Method Partner Fantasia Investment III LLC In 2016 and 2017, through our Operating Partnership, we entered into two separate limited liability company agreements (collectively, the Fantasia Agreements with Fantasia Investment III LLC Fantasia ), an unrelated entity and a U.S.-based affiliate of Fantasia Holdings Group Co., Limited (a Chinese corporation listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (HKEX)), and formed two separate companies, Summit Fantasia Holdings II, LLC Fantasia II JV of which we own a 20 interest in two skilled nursing facilities located in Rhode Island, and through May 1, 2024, Summit Fantasia Holdings III, LLC Fantasia III JV ), for which we owned a 10 interest in eight skilled nursing facilities located in Connecticut (collectively, the Fantasia JVs ). The Fantasia JVs are not consolidated in our condensed consolidated financial statements and are accounted for under the equity-method in our condensed consolidated financial statements. In 2023, the tenants of the two properties in the Fantasia II JV filed for a receivership with the state of Rhode Island and in September 2023, due to the ongoing receivership issues, we determined the fair value of our equity-method investment in the Fantasia II JV to be impaired and wrote off our equity-method balance. However, due to a change in our intention to fund a capital call, if needed, we have recorded additional losses and as of September 30, 2024, the balance of our equity-method investment related to the Fantasia II JV was approximately 0.1) million.

 In May 2024, the Fantasia III JV sold their eight properties for approximately 60.0 million. We received approximately 2.1 million in cash from the sale resulting in the winding-up of our equity-method investment and as such, as of May 2, 2024, we no longer have an equity-method interest in the Fantasia III JV. Summit Fantasy Pearl Holdings, LLC In October 2017, through our Operating Partnership, we entered into a limited liability company agreement (the FPH LLC Agreement with Fantasia, Atlantis Senior Living 9, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company Atlantis ), and Fantasy Pearl LLC, a Delaware limited liability company Fantasy ), and formed Summit Fantasy Pearl Holdings, LLC (the FPH JV ). The FPH JV is not consolidated in our condensed consolidated financial statements and is accounted for under the equity-method in our condensed consolidated financial statements. Due to the tenant resuming regular rent payments in July 2023, we have resumed recording the equity-method interest income and distributions as of April 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the balance of our equity-method investment related to the FPH JV was approximately 0.07) million.

 (1) Net operating income NOI is a non-GAAP supplemental measure used to evaluate the operating performance of real estate properties. We define NOI as total rental revenues, resident fees and services revenue less property operating and resident costs. NOI excludes asset management fees, security deposits from terminated leases, general and administrative expense, depreciation and amortization, income (loss) from equity-method investees, impairment and gains of real estate properties, other income, and interest expense. We believe NOI provides investors relevant and useful information because it measures the operating performance of the REIT s real estate at the property level on an unleveraged basis. We use NOI to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess and compare property-level performance. We believe that net income (loss) is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to NOI. NOI should not be viewed as an alternative measure of operating performance to net income (loss) as defined by GAAP since it does not reflect the aforementioned excluded items. Additionally, NOI as we define it may not be comparable to NOI as defined by other REITs or companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating NOI. 
 Total rental revenues for our properties includes rental revenues and tenant reimbursements for property taxes and insurance. Resident fees and services income are generated from the Operated Properties. Property operating costs include insurance and property taxes, and resident costs are related to the Operated Properties. Net operating income decreased approximately 1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the derecognition of the GA8 Properties as of March 12, 2024, which resulted in a decrease in total rental revenues and property operating costs (which includes no straight-line rent for the three months ended September 30, 2024) of approximately 1.7 million and 0.1 million from the sale of the CA3 Properties in September 2024, offset by an increase of 0.5 million due to the changes in certain leases for our JV properties in September 2023 and by an increase in net operating income of approximately 0.2 million for the Operated Properties. The decrease in general and administrative of 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily due to a decrease in payroll and legal of approximately 0.3 million and 0.2 million, respectively, offset by the cancellation of a software project of 0.1 million. The decrease in depreciation and amortization of 1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily due to the derecognition of the GA8 Properties and no longer recording depreciation and amortization expense.

The approximately 6.4 million gain on derecognition of assets associated with GA8 Properties resulted from the derecognition of the GA8 Properties in March 2024, related specifically to the additional interest expense accrued for the three months ended September 30, 2024. See Note 14 in the accompanying Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The gain on sale of real estate properties for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 11.2 million is related to the sale of CA3 properties. See Note 3 to the accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The decrease in loss from equity-method investees of approximately 1.6 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 is mainly due to the impairment loss and write off of the equity-method investment of 1.2 million related to the Fantasia II JV, our share of the impairment in one property in the SUL JV of 0.1 million, and loss from the Fantasia III JV for 0.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 and no impairment or write-offs in the three months ended September 30, 2024. The change in gain on consolidation of interest in unconsolidated equity-method investment of approximately 1.1 million is due to the consolidation of a variable interest entity (Fantasia I JV) in July 2023 and the related gain and then the subsequent sale of the real estate in September 2023. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023

Resident fees and services income are generated from the Operated Properties. Property operating costs include insurance, and property taxes, and resident costs are related to the Operated Properties. Net operating income decreased approximately 5.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the derecognition of the GA8 Properties as of March 12, 2024, which resulted in a decrease in total rental revenues and property operating costs (which includes no straight-line rent for the three months ended September 30, 2024) of approximately 5.9 million and 0.1 million from the sale of the CA3 Properties in September 2024, offset by an increase of 0.1 million due to the changes in certain leases for our JV properties in September 2023.

Table of Contents 
 The decrease in general and administrative of 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily due to a decrease in payroll of approximately 0.4 million offset by the cancellation of a software project and other expenses of 0.2 million. The decrease in depreciation and amortization of 3.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily due to the derecognition of the GA8 Properties in March 2024 and no longer recording depreciation and amortization expense. The impairment of real estate properties for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 11.4 million is related to the GA8 properties. See Note 14 to the accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The approximately 27.5 million gain on derecognition of assets associated with GA8 Properties resulted from the derecognition of the GA8 Properties in March 2024, specifically related to the additional interest expense of approximately 8.5 million accrued for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the original gain of 17.7 million recorded in March 2024. See Note 14 in the accompanying Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The gain on sale of real estate properties for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 11.2 million is related to the sale of CA3 properties. See Note 3 to the accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The change from loss to income from equity-method investees of approximately 3.2 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is mainly due to income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of approximately 1.6 million 0.8 million equity-method income recorded from the sale of the properties in the SUL JV and 0.8 million equity-method income recorded from the sale of properties in the Fantasia III JV in May 2024) and losses from equity-method investees for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to the impairment loss and write off of the equity-method investment of approximately 1.2 million related to the Fantasia II JV, our share of the impairment in one property in the SUL JV of 0.1 million. The change in gain on consolidation of interest in unconsolidated equity-method investment of approximately 1.1 million is due to the consolidation of a variable interest entity (Fantasia I JV) in July 2023 and the related gain and then the subsequent sale of the real estate in September 2023. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 24.2 million in cash and cash equivalents on hand. Based on current conditions, we believe that we have sufficient capital resources to sustain operations. Going forward, we expect our primary sources of cash to be rental revenues and equity-method investment distributions. In addition, we may increase cash through the sale of additional properties, which may result in the derecognition of properties we already own, or borrowing against currently-owned properties. For the foreseeable future, we expect our primary uses of cash to be for funding future acquisitions, investments in joint ventures, operating expenses, interest expense on outstanding indebtedness and the repayment of principal on loans payable. We may also incur expenditures for renovations of our existing properties, making our facilities more appealing in their market. Seven of our loans payable obligations are long-term, fixed rate U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development HUD )-insured loans that mature between 2039 and 2055. The other loan payable obligations are short-term loans that mature in December 2024 through December 2026 with variable interest rates. See Notes 4 and 14 to the accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding management s plan of action to address the maturity of these loans payable. Additionally, the current interest rate environment has had a negative effect on our results of operations, which could result in foreclosure or other action (see Notes 4 and 14 to the accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements); however, we are currently working with the GA8 Properties lenders and expect the liabilities associated with the GA8 Properties to be released upon final resolution with the lender in exchange for the transfer of ownership of the GA8 Properties. Our liquidity will increase if cash from operations exceeds expenses, we receive net proceeds from the sale of whole or partial interest in a property or properties, or refinancing results in excess loan proceeds. Our liquidity will decrease as proceeds are expended in connection with our acquisitions and operation of properties. In regard to our Operated Properties, our intent is to stabilize the operations of the facilities and market them for sale due to the significantly reduced willingness of AL manager/operators to execute long-term triple-net leases.

 Credit Facilities and Loan Agreements As of September 30, 2024, we had debt obligations of approximately 43.0 million, excluding the loans payable associated with the GA8 Properties. The outstanding balance by lender, excluding loans payable associated with the GA8 Properties, is as follows (see Notes 4 and 14 to the accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our GA8 Properties): Capital One Multifamily Finance, LLC (HUD-insured) approximately 9.8 million maturing September 2053 Lument Capital (formerly ORIX Real Estate Capital, LLC) (HUD-insured) approximately 33.2 million maturing from September 2039 through April 2055 CIBC Bank, USA-Master Letter of Credit Agreement for 1.0 million (none outstanding) 
 Distributions We made no stockholder distributions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Funds from Operations FFO FFO is a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure that is widely recognized as a measure of REIT operating performance. We compute FFO in accordance with the definition outlined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT ). NAREIT defines FFO as net income (loss), computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of property, plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Our FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do. We believe that FFO is helpful to investors and our management as a measure of operating performance because it excludes real estate depreciation and amortization, gains and losses from property dispositions, impairments and extraordinary items, and as a result, when compared period to period, reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, development activities, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which is not immediately apparent from net income. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting alone to be insufficient. As a result, our management believes that the use of FFO, together with the required GAAP presentations, provide a more complete understanding of our performance. Factors that impact FFO include start-up costs, fixed costs, delays in buying assets, lower yields on cash held in accounts pending investment, income from portfolio properties and other portfolio assets, interest rates on acquisition financing and operating expenses. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), as an indication of our performance, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions.

 The following is the reconciliation from net income (loss) applicable to common stockholders, the most direct comparable financial measure calculated and presented with GAAP, to FFO for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Not applicable. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer) evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report because of our continued remediation of the material weakness identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as discussed in greater detail below. We believe the disclosure deficiencies with respect to the notice of default were primarily due to the unusual nature of such events and the time needed to assess the implications of the notice for the Company. We have taken, and continue to take, steps to remediate the control deficiencies contributing to the disclosure deficiencies identified above. Management has reviewed our processes and controls related to our disclosures surrounding events of defaults, and have educated control owners concerning the principles and requirements around controls related to these events. Management is exploring the implementation of new processes to help mitigate the risk that the relevant controls do not operate effectively.

 Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting As disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, based on their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer) had concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2023. As part of the fiscal year 2023 audit, management identified a material weakness. Specifically, the Company failed to design, maintain and monitor certain financial reporting controls specific to significant and unusual transactions, as a result of insufficient technical accounting resources at the Company. Consequently, the Company failed to properly analyze and assess certain events for technical accounting implications in a timely fashion. We have taken, and continue to take, steps to remediate the control deficiencies contributing to the material weakness described above. These remediation actions have included hiring consultants to assist the Company in the design, maintenance and monitoring of certain financial reporting controls that will prevent such deficiencies in the future, as well as to provide technical accounting resources when the Company may not have such resources within the accounting function at the Company, especially when complex transactions are entered into. Management will report regularly to our Audit Committee on the progress and results of our remediation plan, and we may take additional measures to address these control deficiencies, or we may modify certain of the remediation measures described above. Other than as described above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. See Note 12 to the accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of our material legal proceedings. Item 1A. Risk Factors. There have been no material changes to the Risk Factors described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. (a) We did not sell any equity securities that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, during the periods covered by this Form 10-Q. (b) Not applicable. (c) During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we have not redeemed any of our equity securities. Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. See Notes 4 and 14 to the accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements with respect to the status of our loans payable. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. None. Item 5. Other Information. None of our directors or officers , , or a Rule 10b5 - 1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5 - 1 trading arrangement during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as such terms are defined under Item 408(a) of Regulation S - K.
