million and million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we generated a net loss from continuing operations of million and million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , we generated a loss from operations of million and million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , we generated a net loss from continuing operations of million and million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 , we had cash and cash equivalents of and a working capital deficit of million. Over the past couple of years, the Company has completed a series of measures aimed at both lessening the impact of seasonality upon its business and reducing its cost structure and associated operating losses. Among these measures have been reductions in headcount and closure of unprofitable locations. With the sale of underperforming assets over this same period, the Company has generated proceeds totaling 2.0 million, most of which has been used to retire debt. During the second quarter of 2024, we began exploring options to exit our seasonal frac water heating business. In the third quarter of 2024, we i) closed on our acquisition of Buckshot, which is a Wyoming limited liability company and provider of logistics and transportation services to the oil, gas and broader energy sector, and ii) sold certain Colorado-based assets of Heat Waves that were primarily utilized in the Company's Colorado-based frac water heating business. In addition, during the third quarter of 2024, we received gross proceeds of million from the issuance of a promissory note and million from the sale of future receivables. See Note 4 - Discontinued Operations for further information on our discontinued operations resulting from the sale mentioned above. 
 
 On October 23, 2024, Buckshot entered into a Credit and Security Agreement related to a revolving loan facility of up to million, pursuant to which Buckshot may borrow up to of its outstanding accounts receivable. The Credit and Security Agreement also has limitations on Buckshot's ability to make distributions to the parent Company. Despite these recent developments and the improvements to our financial position, we believe that substantial doubt exists over our ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months after the date of issuance of this Quarterly Report on Form 10 -Q. 
 
 We utilize a cash forecast model to evaluate the ability of future cash flows to fund continuing operations. We analyze projected cash flows to determine if they are sufficient to fund the operations and obligations of the Company for a period of time that extends twelve months or more from the date of the applicable filing. We will need to raise additional capital for our growth and ongoing operations. In the second quarter of 2024, we entered an equity line of credit with a financial partner to assist with equity raises. The Company discontinued utilizing the equity line of credit in the third quarter of 2024 given the resultant downward pressure on the price of the Company's common stock and, more recently, due to the Company moving from the NYSE American exchange to the Over-the-Counter Qualified Bulletin ("OTCQB") market after failing to meet the NYSE American's stockholders' equity requirement. Our ability to obtain additional financing through debt and equity capital markets, whether public or private, is subject to several factors including market and economic conditions, our performance, and investor sentiment with respect to us and our industry.

The Company follows the guidance of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's ("FASB") Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016 - 13, Financial Statements - Credit Losses (Topic 326 ): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments , which requires companies to measure credit losses utilizing a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires a consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to ascertain credit loss estimates.

As of December 31, 2023, customer represented 10 or more of the Company's accounts receivable balance. 
 
 million, payable as follows: (i) in cash; and (ii) a promissory note in the principal amount of issued by HP Oilfield in favor of the Company (the "HP Note"), with principal payments of plus accrued interest due and payable on the first day of each month beginning October 1, 2024 for a term of five months. The HP Note matures on February 1, 2025 and interest accrues on the unpaid principal thereof at a rate of per annum. As part of the Assignment, HP Oilfield also agreed not to solicit business in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio for an eight -month period. As result of this transaction, the Company recorded a gain on disposal of assets for discontinued operations in the amount of for the three months ended September 30, 2024 in its condensed consolidated statement of operations. 
 
 Additionally, the Company granted a buyer a ten -month option to purchase certain heating assets of the Company for million, which has not been exercised as of the date of this filing. 
 
 As a result of the above and our operational decision to exit entirely from the frac water heating business, the carrying amounts of the major classes of assets and liabilities of these discontinued operations have been presented separately on our condensed consolidated balance sheets for each of the periods presented. Further, operational results of these discontinued operations have been presented separately on our condensed consolidated statements of operations and the related cash flows of these discontinued operations have been presented separately on our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for each of the periods presented. See Note 4 - Discontinued Operations to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 of inventories. 

Long-Lived Assets 
 
 The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recovered. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the Company concluded that there were triggering events which could indicate potential impairment of its long-lived assets for continuing operations. 

on its assets held for sale as part of its discontinued operations. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded impairment charges on its assets held for sale as part of its discontinued operations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded impairment charges of on its assets held for sale as part of its discontinued operations. 
 
 Upon determining that a long-lived asset or disposal group meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, the Company ceases depreciation and reports long-lived assets and/or the assets and liabilities of the disposal group, if material, in the line item "Assets held for sale" in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

(the Base Amount ), subject to a net working capital adjustment, plus up to in the form of Enservco common stock, contingent upon satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Buckshot Purchase Agreement. The Base Amount consisted of in cash and in shares of Enservco common stock based on the volume-weighted average of Enservco common stock for the 10 -day period immediately preceding the closing date. 
 
 On August 8, 2024, the Company entered into an Amendment to Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the Buckshot Amendment with the Sellers and Buckshot. The Buckshot Amendment amends the Buckshot Purchase Agreement to provide that in lieu of the cash payment due at closing, the Company would pay Messrs. Sims and Fate an aggregate of in cash at closing and issue promissory notes to each of Mr. Sims principal amount) and Mr. Fate principal amount) in the aggregate principal amount of (each, a Buckshot Note and together, the Buckshot Notes ). The Buckshot Notes are unsecured, non-convertible, due on December 31, 2024 and bear interest at per annum. The Buckshot Amendment also provides that the Company will withhold and retain of the cash consideration and of the stock consideration in order to secure the indemnification obligations of the Sellers under the Buckshot Purchase Agreement, as amended. 
 
 The Company closed on the acquisition of Buckshot on August 8, 2024 and issued to the Sellers an aggregate of shares of Company common stock and the Buckshot Notes in aggregate principal amount of . 
 
 The acquisition of Buckshot was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method pursuant to ASC 805. As the acquirer for accounting purposes, the Company estimated the purchase price, assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date, with the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired recognized as goodwill. 

The Company is in the process of finalizing the allocation of the purchase price. As a result, the fair value estimates assigned to intangible assets, goodwill and the related tax impacts of the acquisition, among other items, are preliminary and subject to change as additional information is received to complete the analysis, including final adjustments to intangible assets and certain net working capital accounts. The Company expects to finalize the valuation as soon as practicable, but no later than one year after the acquisition date. The preliminary purchase price allocation as of the acquisition date is presented as follows (in thousands): 

Buckshot Notes 
 Cash paid 
 Working capital payable 
 Earn-out liability 
 Cash withheld 
 Total purchase consideration 
 
 Purchase price allocation: 
 Cash and cash equivalents 
 Accounts receivable 
 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 
 Property and equipment 
 Intangible assets (customer relationships - 12 years) 
 Goodwill 
 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
 Long-term debt 
 Lease liability - finance 
 Fair value of net assets acquired 

The preliminary excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired was recorded as goodwill and is primarily attributed to an assembled workforce, market presence and business reputation. The goodwill balance is not deductible for income tax purposes. 
 
 Acquisition-related costs of and associated with the Buckshot Acquisition were included in sales, general, and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 
 Since the acquisition date, million of revenues and of net income from Buckshot have been included in the condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 The following unaudited supplemental pro forma combined financial information presents the Company s combined results of continuing operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands) as if the Buckshot Acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2023. The pro forma financial information is presented for comparative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the Company s operating results that may have occurred had the Buckshot Acquisition been completed on January 1, 2023. In addition, the unaudited pro forma financial information does not give effect to any anticipated cost savings, operating efficiencies or other synergies that may be associated with the merger, or any estimated costs that have been or will be incurred by the Company to integrate the assets and operations of Buckshot.

The unaudited pro forma financial information reflects adjustments to present the combined pro forma results of continuing operations as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2023 to give effect to certain events the Company believes to be directly attributable to the acquisition. These pro forma adjustments primarily include: 
 
 (i) the elimination of Buckshot historical depreciation and amortization expense and the recognition of new depreciation and amortization expense; 
 
 (ii) an adjustment to present acquisition-related transaction costs and other one -time costs directly attributable to the acquisition as if they were incurred in the earliest period presented; and 
 
 (iii) the related income tax effects of the adjustments noted above, as applicable.

During this fifteen day period, trading of the Company's common stock on the NYSE American was suspended. On November 19, 2024, the NYSE American filed a Form 25 with the SEC to delist the Company's common stock and the delisting was effective ten days thereafter. The Company's common stock began trading on the OTCQB market on November 6, 2024.

 On December 10, 2024, the Company received a notice of event of default and demand from Star regarding the Star Note with respect to a payment that was due and not paid on November 10, 2024. Pursuant to Section 4 of the Star Note Purchase Agreement, non-payment for more than thirty days is considered a continuation of an event of default and, as such, the payment of the entirety of the Star Note and accrued ad unpaid interest is now due and payable.

Recent Developments 

Credit and Security Agreement with Pathward National Association 

On October 23, 2024, the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Buckshot Trucking, LLC ("Buckshot") , entered into a Credit and Security Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with Pathward, National Association ("Pathward") providing a Revolving Loan Facility (the "Loan") of up to 3.5 million, based upon the eligible receivables of Buckshot.

 Star Note Notice of Event of Default and Demand 
 
 On December 10, 2024, the Company received a notice of event of default and demand from Star regarding the Star Note with respect to a payment that was due and not paid on November 10, 2024. Pursuant to Section 4 of the Star Note Purchase Agreement, non-payment for more than thirty days is considered a continuation of an event of default and, as such, the payment of the entirety of the Star Note and accrued ad unpaid interest is now due and payable.

 On December 17, 2024, the Company was informed telephonically by Star that it had cancelled all of the 10 Series A Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock of Star beneficially owned by the Company pursuant to the stock pledge agreement. On December 19, 2024, the Company informed Star via letter, among other things, that it was disputing whether Star's cancellation of all of the 10 Series A Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock of Star beneficially owned by the Company complied with the provisions of the stock pledge agreement and Article 9 of the uniform commercial code and that cancellation of all of the 10 Series A Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock of Star beneficially owned by the Company (which had a recent closing sales price of 9.16) was not commercially reasonable pursuant to the uniform commercial code. 
 
 Recent Market Conditions 
 
 The domestic energy market remains subject to variations within the global energy sector as well as political and broader economic changes. The Company has historically witnessed some positive correlation between the price of crude oil and the number of wells in production within the U.S. Demand for the Company's services has typically been dependent upon the number of domestic wells in operation. As oil prices rose historically, the number of oil rigs in operation would also generally rise. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, WTI crude oil prices remained relatively flat averaging 78 per barrel, versus an average of 77 per barrel for the comparable period last year. During this same period, the U.S. experienced a decline in total domestic rigs in operation, with 587 domestic rigs in operation as of September 30, 2024 compared to 631 domestic rigs in operation as of September 30, 2023. With a decline in the number of wells in operation during a period of relative price stability, the Company has experienced a change in the dynamics within the market for its services. The Company has experienced less predictability for its services based upon domestic well activity. 
 
 Due to this unpredictability within the frac water heating and hot oiling operations, the Company chose to diversify into the energy logistics sector with the acquisition of Buckshot. The energy logistics market is vast and the Company's opportunity to expand its footprint of services, as well as broaden its reach of offerings outside of the oil and gas sector and into other areas within the broader energy sector, provides extensive opportunities for future growth.

OVERVIEW 
 
 Enservco through its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the "Company", "we" or "us") provides various services to the domestic onshore oil and natural gas industry and the broader energy sector. These services include hot oiling and acidizing ("Production Services") and logistics and transportation services within the energy sector ("Logistics Services"). 
 
 Until August 2024, our business consisted exclusively of providing on-site oil and maintenance services to oil and gas production and fracking companies. This business, especially that of providing heated water for oil and natural gas fracking, was prone to seasonality and lower margins, resulting in weaker second and third quarter revenues. To help diversify our business, we elected to sell much of our fracking equipment that was servicing our Colorado, North Dakota, and Wyoming markets. Accordingly, on August 6, 2024, we sold certain Colorado-based assets primarily utilized in the Company s frac water heating business for 1.695 million to HP Oilfield Services, LLC HP Oilfield ). Additionally, we granted a buyer a ten-month option to purchase certain frac water heating assets of the Company that service the Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio markets for 1.85 million. As a result of the above and our operational decision to work to exit entirely from the frac water heating business, the assets for which the ten-month purchase option has been granted are currently classified within "Long-term assets of discontinued operations" on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. Further, operational results for this business segment have been presented as discontinued operations in our condensed consolidated statements of operations and condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for each of the periods presented. The Company s remaining oil and maintenance services consist of hot oiling and acidizing services for oil wells, primarily in Texas. 
 
 Also in August 2024, we entered the energy logistics business through our acquisition of Buckshot for 5 million, subject to a net working capital adjustment, plus up to 500,000 in the form of Enservco common stock, contingent upon satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Buckshot Purchase Agreement. Buckshot focuses on hot shot trucking (i.e., expedited transportation in the oil, gas and broader energy sector), dedicated freight services, and less-than-truckload ("LTL") services within the oil, gas and broader energy sector. 
 
 With respect to our Production Services segment, we own and operate a fleet of spe cialized trucks, trailers and other well-site related equipment and serve customers in several major domestic oil and gas areas, including the Eagle Ford Shale and East Texas Oilfield in Texas. With respect to our Logistics Services segment, Buckshot's mixed class size fleet is comprised of trucks and trailers ranging from semis to pickup trucks with most power units pulling trailers of various sizes. Buckshot's current focus is within Texas and the greater Rocky Mountain Region, with an extensive operational presence in Wyoming, Utah, North Dakota, and Texas. 
 
 The Company s corporate offices are located at 14133 County Road 9 1/2, Longmont, CO 80504. Our telephone number is (303) 333-3678. Our website is www.enservco.com . 
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Executive Summary 
 
 Until August 2024, our business has been highly seasonal, with more than half of our revenues being generated in the colder seasons of each year (winter and spring). Accordingly, the second and third quarters of each year have traditionally been slower seasons for our services, as frac water heating activities are mostly unnecessary for our customers during the warmer months of each year. In August 2024, we entered the energy logistics business through our acquisition of Buckshot to diversify into the energy logistics sector. The energy logistics market is vast and the Company's opportunity to expand its footprint of services, as well as broaden its reach of offerings outside of the oil and gas sector and into other areas within the broader energy sector, provides extensive opportunities for future growth. 
 
 Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 1.4 million, or 52 , as compared to the same period in 2023. Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 709,000, or 8 , as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was due to our acquisition of Buckshot and our new Logistics Services segment revenues, which did not occur in the prior year. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was also due to our acquisition of Buckshot and our new Logistics Services segment revenues, which did not occur in the prior year, partially offset by decreases in our Production Services segment revenues. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a segment profit of 682,000 as compared to a segment loss of 528,000 for the same period in 2023. This represents an increase of 1.2 million. Segment profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 560,000, or 54 , as compared to the same period in 2023. These improvements to segment profit were the result of our acquisition of Buckshot and our new Logistics Services segment profit, which did not occur in the prior year, as well as cost savings measures in other areas of operations, coupled with an increase in industry activity as discussed above. 
 
 Sales, general, and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 785,000, or 80 , as compared to the same period in 2023. Sales, general, and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 820,000, or 24 , as compared to the same period in 2023. These increases were due to additional expenses incurred related to the acquisition of Buckshot, as well as increased headcount. 
 
 Net loss from continuing operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.0 million, or a loss of 0.04 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of 2.8 million, or a loss of 0.11 per basic and diluted share, for the same period in 2023. Net loss from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 5.8 million, or a loss of 0.16 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of 5.5 million, or a loss of 0.27 per basic and diluted share, for the same period in 2023. The improvement in net loss from continuing operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was the direct result of our Buckshot acquisition discussed previously, coupled with a significant reduction in depreciation expense, partially offset by increased sales, general, and administrative expenses. The worsening in net loss from continuing operations for the the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was the direct result of increased sales, general, and administrative expenses, coupled with debt conversion inducement costs recognized during the second and third quarters of 2024, partially offset by our Buckshot acquisition discussed previously and a significant reduction in depreciation expense. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was a loss of 975,000 compared to a loss of 1.4 million for the same period in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a loss of 2.1 million compared to a loss of 1.8 million for the same period in 2023. The changes in Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023 were directly attributable to improvements in our segment profits (losses) for both periods presented, partially or fully offset by increases in our sales, general, and administrative expenses, as discussed above. See the section below titled "Adjusted EBITDA" within this Item 2 for our definition of Adjusted EBITDA.

Production Services 
 
 Production Services segment revenues, which accounted for 58 of total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 298,000, or 11 , as compared to the same period in 2023. This segment's revenues, which accounted for 82 of total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 947,000, or 11 , as compared to the same period in 2023. These decreases were due to decreased activity levels for our hot oiling and acidizing services. 
 
 Hot oiling revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 221,000, or 9 , as compared to the same period in 2023. Hot oiling revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 476,000, or 6 , as compared to the same period in 2023. These decreases were due to decreased activity levels for this service line in certain of the areas we operate in. 
 
 Acidizing revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 77,000, or 37 , as compared to the same period in 2023. Acidizing revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 471,000, or 61 , as compared to the same period in 2023. These decreases were due to decreased activity levels for this service line in certain of the areas we operate in.

Segment profit for Production Services for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 230,000, or 22 , as compared to the same period in 2023. The improvement in Production Services segment loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was the result of third quarter decreases in headcount for personnel that primarily operate in our Production Services' segment. The decrease in Production Services segment profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was the result of the decreases in Production Services' segment revenues, as discussed above. 
 
 Logistics Services 
 
 Logistics Services segment revenues, which accounted for 42 and 18 of total revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, were 1.7 million.

Direct Operating Expenses 
 
 Direct operating expenses, which include labor costs, propane, fuel, chemicals, truck repairs and maintenance, supplies, insurance, and site overhead costs for our operating segments, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 148,000, or 5 , as compared to the same period in 2023. Direct operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 149,000, or 2 , as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was the result of the introduction of our Logistics Services segment, which did not exist in the prior year, partially offset by cost savings measures in other areas of operations, which the Company has seen continued improvement in each year since 2022. 
 
 Sales, General, and Administrative Expenses 
 
 Sales, general, and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 785,000, or 80 , as compared to the same period in 2023. Sales, general, and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 820,000, or 24 , as compared to the same period in 2023. These increases were due to additional expenses incurred related to the acquisition of Buckshot, as well as increased headcount. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 407,000, or 48 , as compared to the same period in 2023. Depreciation and amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 726,000, or 42 , as compared to the same period in 2023. These decreases were the result of dispositions of certain assets of the Company over the last year, most of which were primarily utilized in the Company's discontinued Colorado-based frac water heating business. 
 
 Income (Loss) from Operations 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a loss from operations of 1.5 million compared to a loss from operations of 2.4 million for the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a loss from operations of 3.6 million compared to a loss from operations of 4.1 million for the same period in 2023. These improvements to losses from operations were the result of improvements in almost every operating expense category for the current year as compared to the prior year, partially offset by increases in sales general, and administrative expenses, further discussed above. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 
 Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 63,000, or 13 , as compared to the same period in 2023. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 178,000, or 11 , as compared to the same period in 2023. These decreases were the result of lower interest expense in the current period on certain of our higher interest rate debt obligations, when compared to the prior period, due in large part to paydowns of principal or conversions of certain convertible debt instruments to equity.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 Non-GAAP results are presented only as a supplement to the financial statements and for use within management s discussion and analysis based on GAAP. The non-GAAP financial information is provided to enhance the reader's understanding of the Company s financial performance, but no non-GAAP measure should be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of the most directly comparable GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided herein. 
 
 EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) from continuing operations, before interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation expense from EBITDA and, when appropriate, other items that management does not consider useful in assessing the Company s ongoing operating performance as set forth in the next paragraph. None of these non-GAAP financial measures are recognized terms under GAAP and do not purport to be an alternative to net income (loss) from continuing operations as an indicator of operating performance or any other GAAP measure. 
 
 All of the items included in the reconciliation of net income (loss) from continuing operations to EBITDA and from EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA are either (i) non-cash items (e.g., depreciation, amortization of purchased intangibles, stock-based compensation expense, bad debt expense (recovery), etc.) or (ii) items that management does not consider to be useful in assessing the Company s ongoing operating performance (e.g., income taxes, other expense (income), interest expense, non-recurring legal and transaction costs, etc.). In the case of the non-cash items, management believes that investors can better assess the company s operating performance if the measures are presented without such items because, unlike cash expenses, these adjustments do not affect the Company s ability to generate free cash flow or invest in its business. 
 
 We use, and we believe investors benefit from the presentation of, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in evaluating our operating performance because it provides us and our investors with an additional tool to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our core operations. We believe that EBITDA is useful to investors and other external users of our financial statements in evaluating our operating performance because EBITDA is widely used by investors to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense, taxes, and depreciation and amortization, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired. 
 
 Because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company s presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. However, these measures can still be useful in evaluating the Company s performance against its peer companies because management believes the measures provide users with valuable insight into key components of GAAP financial disclosures. 

Changes in Adjusted EBITDA Loss 

Adjusted EBITDA loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 improved by 432,000, or 31 , as compared to the same period in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 worsened by 327,000, or 18 , as compared to the same period in 2023. These changes were directly attributable to improvements in our segment profits (losses) for both periods presented, partially or fully offset by increases in our sales, general, and administrative expenses.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 
 Cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.2 million compared to 2.3 million for the same period in 2023. This decrease in cash used in operating activities of 100,000 was primarily due to improvements in our segment profit, partially offset by increases in sales, general, and administrative expenses. 
 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 
 Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 824,000 compared to 58,000 for the same period in 2023. This increase in cash used in investing activities of 766,000 was due to net cash payments made in our acquisition of Buckshot as well as cash paid for software capitalized as an intangible asset. 
 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 
 Cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.9 million compared to 263,000 for the same period in 2023. This increase in cash used in financing activities of 2.7 million was due to increased repayments on our Utica Facility and the non-recurrence of prior year net proceeds from the February 2023 Offering and the September 2023 Convertible Notes, partially offset by current year net proceeds from the Libertas Notes and Star Note.

Overview 
 
 We have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from borrowings under credit facilities, debt financing arrangements including those with related parties, proceeds from sales of our equity securities and non-core or underperforming assets, and cash generated from operations. 
 
 On June 7, 2024, pursuant to a Note Conversion Agreement, Cross River converted 1,222,356 of principal plus accrued but unpaid interest on the November 2022 Convertible Note into 4,495,609 shares of the Company s common stock. Unamortized debt discount costs totaling 87,000 were also converted to equity as part of this note conversion. As an inducement for this note conversion, the Company incurred 495,000 in expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, recognized within the line item "Other (expense) income" in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 Additionally on June 7, 2024, pursuant to a Note Conversion Agreement, Cross River converted 926,827 of principal plus accrued but unpaid interest on certain of the September and October 2023 Convertible Notes into 3,408,707 shares of the Company s common stock. Additionally, on June 7, 2024, pursuant to a Note Conversion Agreement, Richard Murphy converted 110,739 of principal plus accrued but unpaid interest on certain of the September and October 2023 Convertible Notes into 407,281 shares of the Company s common stock. As an inducement for these note conversions, the Company incurred 413,000 in expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, recognized within the line item "Other (expense) income" in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 On June 11, 2024, the Company entered into the ELOC Purchase Agreement with an institutional investor, pursuant to which the Company has the right, but not the obligation, to sell to the investor, and the investor is obligated to purchase, up to the lesser of 10.0 million of newly issued shares of the Company s common stock, and 7,310,000 shares of common stock, which represents 19.99 of the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the execution of the ELOC Purchase Agreement (the Exchange Cap ). However, the Exchange Cap will not apply if the Company obtains stockholder approval to issue additional shares of common stock. On June 25, 2024, holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company approved, for purposes of applicable NYSE American rules, the issuance of shares in excess of the Exchange Cap under the ELOC Purchase Agreement. 
 
 As consideration for the investor s irrevocable commitment to purchase shares of the Company s common stock under the ELOC Purchase Agreement, the Company has issued to the investor 545,554 shares of common stock and has agreed to issue an additional 100,000 in shares of common stock to the investor under the terms of the ELOC Purchase Agreement. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company received net proceeds of 663,000 on sales of 4,400,000 shares of common stock. The ELOC Purchase Agreement, as originally structured, requires that the Company maintain its listing on the NYSE American. The Company discontinued utilizing the equity line of credit in the third quarter of 2024 given the resultant downward pressure on the price of the Company's common stock and, more recently, due to the Company moving from the NYSE American exchange to the OTCQB market after failing to meet the NYSE American's stockholders' equity requirement. As a result of this move to the OTCQB market, the equity line of credit is no longer accessible by the Company in accordance with the original structure of the ELOC Purchase Agreement. 
 
 On July 12, 2024, pursuant to a Note Conversion Agreement, Kevin Chesser converted 50,000 of principal on certain of the September and October 2023 Convertible Notes into 183,891 shares of the Company s common stock. As an inducement for this note conversion, the Company incurred 22,000 in expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, recognized within the line item "Other (expense) income" in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 On August 9, 2024, the Company entered into a share exchange agreement with Star, pursuant to which the Company sold to Star: (i) 9,023,035 shares of the Company s common stock, and (ii) 3,476,965 shares of the Company s 2 Cumulative Mandatorily Convertible Series A Preferred Stock (the Series A Preferred Shares in exchange for 250,000 shares of Star s 10 Series A Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (which preferred stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol "STRRP"). Star s 10 Series A Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock was valued at 10 par value per share, for a total share exchange value of 2.5 million. Star also has the right to exchange up to an additional 2.5 million of Series A Preferred Shares for an additional 2.5 million of Enservco common stock, calculated based on the transaction price of 0.20 per share. 
 
 Additionally on August 9, 2024, the Company entered into a note purchase agreement (the "Star Note Purchase Agreement") with Star Equity Holdings, Inc. ("Star") providing for the sale of a promissory note to Star (the "Star Note") in the aggregate principal amount of 1,000,000. The Star Note is non-convertible, has a three-month term, and bears interest at a rate of 20 per annum. The three-month term may be extended an additional month if 60 of the principal amount of the Star Note is paid by the end of such three-month term and an additional one month if 80 of the principal amount is paid by the end of the four month period. The Star Note is secured by the 250,000 shares of 10 Series A Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock of Star held by the Company pursuant to a stock pledge agreement dated as of August 9, 2024. 
 
 On August 13, 2024, the Company entered into a Sale of Future Receivables Agreement (the "Agreement") with Libertas Funding, LLC, a Connecticut limited liability company ("Libertas"), to sell future Company receipts ("Future Receipts") from its Heat Waves subsidiary totaling 967,500 (the "Amount Sold") to Libertas in exchange for a purchase price of 750,000. The Company has agreed to deliver 4.33 (the "Specified Percentage") of Future Receipts every week until the entire Amount Sold and all fees or other amounts have been paid to Libertas. The parties agreed that an approximation of the Specified Percentage is 23,035 per week. Payment of the Amount Sold is guaranteed by Richard A. Murphy, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chairman. 
 
 Further, on September 19, 2024, the Company entered into an additional Sale of Future Receivables Agreement (the "Second Agreement") with Libertas, to sell future Company receipts ("Second Future Receipts") from its Buckshot subsidiary totaling 384,000 (the "Second Amount Sold") to Libertas in exchange for a purchase price of 300,000. The Company has agreed to deliver 4.37 (the "Second Specified Percentage") of Second Future Receipts every week until the entire Second Amount Sold and all fees or other amounts have been paid to Libertas. The parties agreed that an approximation of the Second Specified Percentage is 7,619 per week. Payment of the Second Amount Sold is also guaranteed by Richard A. Murphy, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chairman. 
 
 On October 23, 2024, the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Buckshot, entered into a Credit and Security Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with Pathward, National Association ("Pathward") for a 3.5 million Revolving Loan Facility (the "Loan"). The Credit Agreement provides that Buckshot may borrow up to 90 of its eligible accounts receivable as provided in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement also limits the ability for Buckshot to distribute any Loan proceeds to the Company. 
 
 Our capital requirements for the remainder of 2024 are anticipated to include, but are not limited to, operating expenses, debt servicing, and capital expenditures, including maintenance of our existing fleet of assets. Without additional borrowings or capital infusions, the Company may not be able to meet its capital requirements in the near term and will not be able to solely rely upon its existing agreements and operations to support its operations.

Liquidity 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our available liquidity was 257,000, which was comprised of our cash and cash equivalents balance of 172,000 as well as 85,000 available under the LSQ Facility. 
 
 We believe that our available liquidity will not be sufficient to meet our current obligations for a period of twelve months from the date of the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Accordingly, we have concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 Working Capital 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had a working capital deficit of 5.4 million, compared to a working capital deficit of 6.0 million as of December 31, 2023. This change was due to certain debt instruments moving into current liability classification on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 due to their various maturity dates, partially offset by our newly acquired marketable securities. 
 
 Outlook 
 
 The Company has obligations that are due in the very near term (by December 31, 2024 and January 15, 2025) as of September 30, 2024 in the aggregate amount of 3.3 million an d does not currently have available cash to satisfy such obligations . The Company also has a significant accounts payable balance with certain critical vendors and suppliers as of September 30, 2024 in the aggregate amount of 3.9 million. The Company is attempting to sell certain assets to satisfy such obligations and may attempt to negotiate terms with critical vendors and suppliers. However, even such asset sales and accounts payable agreements, should they materialize, may be insufficient to sustain and continue operations into the first quarter of 2025, which would require the Company to cease operations. 
 
 Historically, our revenues have primarily derived from the performance of services within the domestic oil and natural gas industry, most specifically hot oiling, acidizing services, and frac water heating. In August 2024, we entered the logistics market through our acquisition of Buckshot. Supplemental to these services, we have occasionally performed hauling and labor services for our client base during the slower seasons of late spring, summer and early fall. As a service provider within the energy sector, we are subject to geopolitical influences, demand variances and the drilling activities within the industry. In addition, our discontinued frac water heating services have been further impacted by the extent of cold weather during winter months. The price of crude oil and natural gas greatly impacts the levels of activities of our clients, which in turn impacts our business. The Company has experienced softer or weakened demand for our services over the past few years. We believe the swings in the demand for our services will continue to be cyclical, creating significant doubt about the accuracy of internal models of demand for our services. 
 
 Much of our revenues, specifically completion services revenues, are seasonal and there is no measurable way to anticipate the activity levels of these completion services or the impact of current warmer month demand on the upcoming winter months and heating season. 
 
 Our team has worked diligently to better position the Company to navigate some of the seasonal and demand swings faced by the Company. We have strengthened our balance sheet through proceeds from sales of our equity securities and non-core or underperforming assets, as well as certain convertible note conversions, all of which occurred in 2024. Our LSQ Facility has continued to give us access to a significant portion of the revenues generated on each completed job through cash advances that are generally received within a few days of job completion. Our team has been strengthened by the addition of some key executives and elevation of top performers into roles that better leverage their skills for the benefit of the organization. We have worked diligently to reduce the costs absorbed during the slower months for labor, overhead and related expenses. The team is and has been focused on controlling general and administrative expenses, including those for wages, benefits and insurance, as well as costs related to operating as a public company. 
 
 Capital Commitments and Obligations 
 
 Our obligations as of September 30, 2024 consist primarily of our various debt instruments outstanding as of the balance sheet date, including notes and accounts payable. In addition, we also have scheduled principal payments under finance and operating leases, as well as our financed insurance. General terms and conditions for amounts due under these commitments and obligations are summarized in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. Among these commitments are significant short-term obligations that will require the Company to obtain new financings or capital in order to satisfy, including several debt obligations that are either past due or due within 45 days of the date of this report and certain obligations secured by certain of the Company's equipment assets. Additionally, the Company is past due with several critical vendors and landlords. The Company's current cash from operations is not sufficient to repay these obligations. Absent some new debt financing (which the Company is pursuing) or restructuring of these obligations, the Company may have to consider discontinuing operations and potentially filing for bankruptcy. 
 
 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to our stockholders.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer concluded that, during the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective as management does not yet believe that prior year material weaknesses have been fully remediated. Notwithstanding the material weaknesses, as described below, as of September 30, 2024, management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, believes that the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the fiscal period presented in conformity with GAAP. 
 
 In connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in a prior period, management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. These prior period material weaknesses allowed errors to occur that were not detected in a timely manner, therefore requiring a re-evaluation for the accounting of certain transactions during that time. Management believes these prior period material weaknesses are being remediated through the efforts the Company has undertaken to enhance its system of evaluating and implementing the accounting standards that apply to our accounting for complex financial instruments and accounting for income taxes, including through enhanced analyses by our personnel and third-party professionals with whom we consult regarding complex accounting and tax applications. In addition, the Company has undertaken and is currently undertaking a number of initiatives in its efforts to improve upon its control environment and, ultimately, remediate and prevent material weaknesses in future periods. These initiatives include but are not limited to upgrading its ERP and accounting system, as well as the addition of full-time resource(s) that have had extensive experience with and knowledge of a proper internal control framework and environment. We will continue to remediate, enhance, monitor and test the design and effectiveness of these and other processes, procedures, and controls and make any further changes or determine and obtain any additional resources management deems appropriate. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the Company s three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 On September 30, 2024, the Company received a Declaration of Acceleration of an aggregate of 625,000 principal amount of certain promissory notes issued to Angel Capital Partners, LP and Equigen II, LLC (collectively, the "Note Holders") issued on September 8, 2023, September 11, 2023 and October 5, 2023 with respect to an interest payment that was due July 10, 2024. These notes were issued to the sellers of the OilServ, LLC assets, which the Company acquired in September 2023. From the date of receipt of such declaration, the Company and the Note Holders attempted to settle such default amicably through negotiations. On October 30, 2024, the Company received Notification of Service of a case filed in the District Court of Harris County, Texas that a petition was filed on October 28, 2024 seeking judgment against the Company. On November 27, 2024, the Company and the Note Holders entered into a Settlement Agreement (the "Settlement Agreement") pursuant to which in exchange for dismissal of the lawsuit by the Note Holders, the Company agreed to pay the Note Holders a sum of 759,353 - which includes 625,000 of principal, 99,479 of interest, and 34,874 of attorneys' fees - on or before January 15, 2025. Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the Company agreed to contemporaneously execute certain documents that the Note Holders are authorized to file against the Company if the Company fails to comply with the terms of the Settlement Agreement. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the risk factors set forth below, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties set forth in our other filings with the SEC, including in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following risk factors relate to our recent acquisition of Buckshot and the logistics business: 
 
 We may be unsuccessful in realizing all or any part of the anticipated benefits of the Buckshot acquisition within the expected time period or at all . While we believe the Buckshot acquisition is accretive, the cost, integration, and performance of the Buckshot acquisition may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. The Buckshot acquisition may fail to meet our operational or strategic expectations. The process of integrating Buckshot may involve unforeseen costs and delays or other operational, technical and financial difficulties, and may require a significant or disproportionate amount of time and managerial and financial resources. We may experience difficulties in integrating Buckshot s operations into our business and in realizing the full benefits and synergies from such acquisition within the anticipated timeframe or at all. 
 
 The growth of our business through recent and potential future acquisitions may expose us to various risks. We may pursue selected acquisitions of complementary assets and businesses, such as our recent Buckshot acquisition. The success of this strategy is dependent upon our ability to identify appropriate acquisition targets, negotiate transactions on favorable terms, finance transactions, obtain necessary regulatory approvals, complete transactions and successfully integrate them into our existing business. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including: 

Potential loss of customers, key employees, and third-party service providers 

Difficulties synchronizing operations and assets of the acquired business and any acquired personnel, while continuing to provide consistent, high-quality service to customers; 

Unanticipated issues in the assimilation and consolidation of IT, communications, and other systems, including additional systems training and other labor inefficiencies; 

Potentially unacceptable qualification requirements for contract carriers or other third-party vendors; 

Potentially unfavorable, or adverse changes to, pre-existing contractual relationships; 

Delays in consolidation of corporate and administrative infrastructures; 

Difficulties and costs of synchronizing our policies, procedures, business culture, and benefits and compensation programs; 

Inability to properly assess and maintain effective internal controls over the acquired business and comply with regulatory requirements; 

Difficulties related to additional or unanticipated regulatory and compliance issues; 

Increases in our expenses and working capital requirements; and 

Other unanticipated issues, expenses, and liabilities, including previously unknown liabilities, or legal proceedings which may arise, associated with the acquired business for which we have no, or are unable to secure, recourse under applicable indemnification or insurance provisions. 

To finance any acquisitions, we may choose to issue shares of our common stock as consideration, which could dilute the ownership of our stockholders. If the price of our common stock is low or volatile, we may be unable to consummate any acquisitions using our common stock as consideration. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. 
 
 We may not be successful entering into a very competitive logistics industry . We operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry, and our business could suffer if we are unable to adequately address factors that could affect our profitability, growth prospects, and ability to compete in the transportation and logistics market. 
 
 Our current geographic market is limited and we may not be able to expand to additional markets . Our current market is primarily limited to the greater Rocky Mountain region and parts of Texas. While our plan is to expand into new geographic markets, we will face significant competition from well-established companies that compete in local, regional, national, and, to a lesser extent, international markets. We will compete with LTL carriers of varying sizes, including both union and non-union LTL carriers and, to a lesser extent, with truckload carriers and railroads. We also compete with domestic and global logistics service providers, including asset-light logistics companies, integrated logistics companies, and third-party freight brokers that compete in one or more segments of the transportation industry. We may be unable to expand geographically beyond our current market. 
 
 Increased prices for, or decreases in the availability of, equipment, including new revenue equipment, as well as higher costs of related operating expenses, could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows . In recent years, original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") have significantly raised the prices of equipment, including new revenue equipment, due to supply chain disruptions and other challenges beyond our control, including but not limited to, geopolitical conflicts and significant weather events, in addition to increased costs of materials and labor, above normal inflation levels, and high interest rates, which impact equipment financing. Manufacturers have also raised prices, in part, to offset their costs of compliance with new tractor engine and emissions system design requirements intended to reduce emissions, which have been mandated by the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ("NHTSA"). Additional state-mandated emission-control requirements could increase equipment and fuel costs for entire fleets that operate in interstate commerce. If new equipment prices increase more than anticipated, we could incur higher depreciation and rental expenses than anticipated. Our third-party capacity providers, including owner-operators for portions of our planned brokerage segment operations, are also subject to increased regulations and higher equipment and fuel prices, which could, in turn, increase our costs for utilizing their services or may cause certain providers to exit the industry, which could lead to or exacerbate a capacity shortage and further increase our costs of securing third-party services. If we are unable to fully offset any such increases in expenses with freight rate increases and/or improved fuel economy, our results of operations could be adversely affected.

Table of Contents 

We depend on suppliers for equipment, parts, and services that are critical to our operations, which may be difficult to procure in the event of decreased supply or other supply chain disruptions . From time to time, some OEMs of tractors and trailers may reduce their manufacturing output due to, for example, lower demand for their products in economic downturns or a shortage of component parts. For example, significant shortages of semiconductor chips, as experienced through the first half of 2023, and other component parts and supplies, including steel, have forced and may continue to force manufacturers to curtail or suspend their production, leading to a lower supply of tractors and trailers, higher prices, and lengthened trade cycles. Component suppliers may either reduce production or be unable to increase production to meet OEM demand, creating periodic difficulty for OEMs to react in a timely manner to increased demand for new equipment and/or increased demand for replacement components as economic conditions change. 
 
 Fuel shortages, changes in fuel prices, or the inability to collect fuel surcharges could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows . The transportation industry is dependent upon the availability of adequate fuel supplies. A disruption in our fuel supply resulting from natural or man-made disasters; armed conflicts; terrorist attacks; actions by producers, including a decrease in drilling activity or the use of crude oil and oil reserves for purposes other than fuel production; legislation or regulations that require or result in new or alternate uses or other increases in the demand for fuel traditionally used by trucks; or other political, economic, and market factors that are beyond our control could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. 
 
 Fuel represents a significant operating expense for us, and we do not have any long-term fuel purchase contracts or any hedging arrangements to protect against fuel price increases . Fuel prices fluctuate greatly due to factors beyond our control, such as global supply and demand for crude oil and diesel, political events, military conflicts, price and supply decisions by oil producing countries and cartels, terrorist activities, and hurricanes and other natural or man-made disasters. Significant increases in fuel prices or fuel taxes resulting from these or other economic or regulatory changes that are not offset by base freight rate increases or fuel surcharges could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. 
 
 Decreases in fuel prices reduce the cost of transportation services and accordingly, will reduce our revenues and may reduce margins for certain lines of business . Significant changes in the price or availability of fuel in future periods, or significant changes in our ability to mitigate fuel price increases through the use of fuel surcharges, could have a material adverse impact on our operations, fleet capacity and ability to generate both revenues and profits. 
 
 Increases in driver compensation and difficulties with attracting and retaining drivers could adversely affect our revenues and profitability . Our industry is currently experiencing and may, in the future, experience intense competition for qualified drivers in the transportation industry due to a shortage of drivers. The availability of qualified drivers may be affected from time to time by changing workforce demographics, competition from other transportation companies and industries for employees, the availability and affordability of driver training schools, changing industry regulations, and the demand for drivers in the labor market. Additionally, a shortage of drivers could result in the underutilization of our truck fleet, lost revenue, increased costs for purchased transportation or increased costs for driver recruitment. 
 
 These factors subject our business to various risks that may have a material impact on our operating results and future prospects. These risks may include the following : 

A reduction in overall freight volume reduces our opportunities for growth. In addition, if a downturn in our customers business causes a reduction in the volume of freight shipped by those customers, our operating results could be adversely affected; 

Some of our customers may experience financial distress, file for bankruptcy protection, go out of business, or suffer disruptions in their business and may be unable to pay us. In addition, some customers may not pay us as quickly as they have in the past, causing our working capital needs to increase; 

A significant number of our transportation providers may go out of business and we may be unable to secure sufficient equipment capacity or services to meet our commitments to our customers; 

A pandemic or other public health epidemic poses the risk that we or our employees, customers, suppliers, manufacturers and other commercial partners may be prevented from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time, including due to the spread of the disease or shutdowns requested or mandated by governmental authorities; and 

We may not be able to appropriately adjust our expenses to rapid changes in market demand. In order to maintain high variability in our business model, it is necessary to adjust staffing levels when market demand changes. In periods of rapid change, it is more difficult to match our staffing levels to our business needs. In addition, we have other expenses that are primarily variable but are fixed for a period of time, as well as certain significant fixed expenses; we may be unable to adequately adjust these expenses to match a rapid change in demand.
