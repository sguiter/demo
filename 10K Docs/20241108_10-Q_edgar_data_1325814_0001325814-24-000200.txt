 CONDENSED NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

These unaudited Notes to the Financial Statements do not include all of the disclosures required by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles for annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, which are contained in the Bank s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 7, 2024. Throughout this Form 10-Q, acronyms and terms used are defined in the Glossary of Terms . Unless the context otherwise requires, the term Bank refers to the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines or its management. 
 
 district FHLBanks. The FHLBanks are GSEs and were created under the authority of the FHLBank Act in order to serve the public by enhancing the availability of funds for residential mortgages and targeted community development. The Bank is regulated by the Finance Agency. 
 
 The Bank is a cooperative, meaning it is owned by its customers, whom the Bank calls members. As a condition of membership in the Bank, all members must purchase and maintain capital stock to support business activities with the Bank. In return, the Bank provides a readily available source of funding and liquidity to its member institutions and eligible housing associates in Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, Wyoming, and the U.S. Pacific territories of American Samoa, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Commercial banks, savings institutions, credit unions, insurance companies, and CDFIs may apply for membership. State and local housing associates that meet certain statutory criteria may also borrow from the Bank; while eligible to borrow, housing associates are not members of the Bank and, as such, are not permitted to hold capital stock. All stockholders, including current and former members, may receive dividends on their capital stock investment to the extent declared by the Bank s Board of Directors. 

Note 1 
 
 In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim financial information is complete and reflects all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of results for the interim periods. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2024. 
 
 Reclassifications 
 
 Certain amounts in the Bank s 2023 financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the presentation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. These amounts were not deemed to be material. 
 
 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
 There have been no material changes to the Bank s significant accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Descriptions of all significant accounting policies are included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the 2023 Form 10-K.

 of these investments were with counterparties rated below triple-B; however, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately percent and percent were secured securities purchased under agreements to resell with unrated counterparties. NRSRO ratings may differ from any internal ratings of the investments by the Bank. 
 
 Federal funds sold are unsecured loans that are generally transacted on an overnight term. Finance Agency regulations include a limit on the amount of unsecured credit the Bank may extend to a counterparty. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, no allowance for credit losses was recorded for interest-bearing deposits and federal funds sold, as all assets were repaid or expected to be repaid according to their contractual terms. The carrying values of interest-bearing deposits and federal funds sold exclude accrued interest receivable of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 Securities purchased under agreements to resell are secured, short-term, and are structured such that they are evaluated regularly to determine if the market value of the underlying securities decreased below the market value required as collateral (i.e. subject to collateral maintenance provisions). If so, the counterparty must place an equivalent amount of additional securities as collateral or remit an equivalent amount of cash, generally by the next business day. Based upon the collateral held as security and collateral maintenance provisions with its counterparties, the Bank determined that no allowance for credit losses was needed for its securities purchased under agreements to resell at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The carrying value of securities purchased under agreements to resell excludes accrued interest receivable of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 DEBT SECURITIES 
 
 The Bank invests in debt securities, which are classified as either trading, AFS, or HTM. The Bank is prohibited by Finance Agency regulations from purchasing certain higher-risk securities, such as equity securities and debt instruments that are not investment quality. A security is considered to be investment quality if it has adequate financial backing so that full and timely payment of principal and interest is expected and there is minimal risk that the timely payment of principal and interest would not occur because of adverse changes in economic and financial conditions during the projected life of the security. Exceptions are allowed for certain investments targeted at low-income persons or communities, and instruments that experience credit deterioration after their purchase by the Bank.

 ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES 
 
 The Bank evaluates advances for credit losses on a quarterly basis. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, none of the Bank s advances were past due, on non-accrual status, or considered impaired. The Bank considers an advance past due if a default of contractual principal or interest exists for a period of 30 days or more. In addition, there were no modifications related to advances resulting from a borrower experiencing financial difficulties during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 The Bank has never experienced a credit loss on its advances. Based upon the Bank s collateral and lending policies, the collateral held as security, and the repayment history on advances, management has determined that there were no expected credit losses on its advances at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. For additional information on the Bank s allowance methodology, including eligible collateral types, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 5 Advances in the 2023 Form 10-K.

Other delinquency statistics include non-accrual loans and loans in process of foreclosure.

 REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS 
 
 The Bank is subject to regulatory capital requirements: 
 
 Risk-based capital . The Bank must maintain at all times permanent capital greater than or equal to the sum of its credit, market, and operational risk capital requirements, all calculated in accordance with Finance Agency regulations. Only permanent capital, defined as the amounts paid-in for Class B capital stock (including MRCS), and retained earnings can satisfy this risk-based capital requirement. 
 
 Regulatory capital . The Bank is required to maintain a minimum four percent capital-to-asset ratio, which is defined as total regulatory capital divided by total assets. Total regulatory capital includes Class B stock (including MRCS) and retained earnings.

 times and nonpermanent capital weighted times, divided by total assets. The Bank did not hold any nonpermanent capital at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 In addition to the requirements previously discussed, the Capital Stock AB requires each FHLBank to maintain at all times a ratio of at least two percent of capital stock to total assets. For purposes of the Capital Stock AB, capital stock includes MRCS. The capital stock to total assets ratio is measured on a daily average basis at month end. 
 
 If the Bank s capital falls below the required levels, the Finance Agency has authority to take actions necessary to return it to levels that it deems to be consistent with safe and sound business operations.

 million and million compared to net losses of million and million for the same periods in 2023, and the Bank determined no credit risk adjustments for nonperformance were necessary. In determining that no credit risk adjustments were necessary, the Bank considered the following factors: 
 
 The Bank is a federally chartered GSE, and as a result of this status, the Bank s consolidated obligations have historically received the same credit rating as the government bond credit rating of the United States, even though they are not obligations of the United States and are not guaranteed by the United States. 
 
 The Bank is jointly and severally liable with the other FHLBanks for the payment of principal and interest on all consolidated obligations of the FHLBanks.

 1 Excludes commitments to issue standby letters of credit, when applicable. At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank had commitments to issue standby letters of credit. 
 2 The Bank has deemed it unnecessary to record any liability for credit losses on these agreements at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, based on its credit extension and collateral policies. 
 3 The Bank enters into commitments to issue consolidated obligations in the normal course of its business, that generally settle within 30 calendar days. 
 4 The Bank enters into commitments to fund additional advances up to 24 months in the future. 
 
 Standby Letters of Credit . The Bank issues standby letters of credit on behalf of its members to support certain obligations of the members to third-party beneficiaries. Standby letters of credit may be offered to assist members and non-member housing associates in facilitating residential housing finance, community lending, and asset-liability management, and to provide liquidity. In particular, members often use standby letters of credit as collateral for deposits from federal and state government agencies. Standby letters of credit are executed with members for a fee. If the Bank is required to make payment for a beneficiary s draw, the member either reimburses the Bank for the amount drawn or, subject to the Bank s discretion, the amount drawn may be converted into a collateralized advance to the member. The maturities of standby letters of credit outstanding at September 30, 2024 are currently no later than 2038. The carrying value of guarantees related to standby letters of credit are recorded in Other liabilities on the Statements of Condition and amounted to million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 The Bank monitors the creditworthiness of its members and non-member housing associates that have standby letters of credit. The Bank has established parameters for the measurement, review, classification, and monitoring of credit risk related to these standby letters of credit. All standby letters of credit, similar to advances, are fully collateralized at the time of issuance and subject to member borrowing limits as established by the Bank. 
 
 Standby Bond Purchase Agreements . The Bank has entered into standby bond purchase agreements with state housing finance agencies within its district pursuant to which, for a fee, it agrees to serve as a standby liquidity provider if required, to purchase and hold the bonds until the designated marketing agent can find a suitable investor or the state housing finance agency repurchases the bonds according to a schedule established by the agreement. Each standby bond purchase agreement includes the provisions under which the Bank would be required to purchase the bonds and typically allows the Bank to terminate the agreement upon the occurrence of a default event of the issuer. At September 30, 2024, the Bank had standby bond purchase agreements with state housing finance agencies. The maturities of standby bond purchase agreements outstanding at September 30, 2024 are currently no later than 2029. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Bank was not required to purchase any bonds under these agreements. 
 
 Commitments to Purchase Mortgage Loans . The Bank enters into commitments that unconditionally obligate it to purchase mortgage loans from its members. These commitments are considered derivatives and their estimated fair value at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is reported in Note 6 Derivatives and Hedging Activities as mortgage loan purchase commitments. 
 
 Joint and Several Liability . The FHLBanks have joint and several liability for all consolidated obligations issued. Accordingly, if an FHLBank were unable to repay any consolidated obligation for which it is the primary obligor, each of the other FHLBanks could be called upon by the Finance Agency to repay all or part of such obligations. No FHLBank has ever been asked or required to repay the principal or interest on any consolidated obligation on behalf of another FHLBank. A t September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total par value of outstanding consolidated obligations issued on behalf of other FHLBanks for which the Bank is jointly and severally liable was billion and billion.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 
 
 Our Bank is a member-owned cooperative serving shareholder members in our district. Our mission is to be a reliable provider of funding, liquidity, and services for our members so that they can meet the housing, business, and economic development needs of the communities they serve. In addition, we help to meet the economic and housing needs of our communities through our affordable housing and community investment initiatives. Our operating model balances the trade-off between attractively priced products, reasonable returns on capital stock, maintaining an adequate level of capital to meet regulatory capital requirements, and maintaining adequate retained earnings to preserve the par value of member-owned capital stock. Our members include commercial banks, savings institutions, credit unions, insurance companies, and CDFIs. 
 
 Affordable Housing and Community Impact 
 Our housing and community development programs are central to our mission by providing reliable liquidity and funding to help our members build strong communities and support their affordable housing needs. We contribute 10 percent of our net income each year to our AHP, an annual grant program that supports the creation, preservation, or purchase of affordable housing. This program includes a competitive AHP and two down payment products called Home tart and the Native American Homeownership Initiative. During the third quarter of 2024, we accrued AHP assessments of 23 million and disbursed 13 million of AHP funds through this program. We recorded an additional 4 million voluntary AHP contribution during the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 In addition to our AHP, we offer our members other voluntary programs to further our housing mission and provide more support for affordable housing initiatives. During the third quarter of 2024, we authorized 4 million through Mortgage Rate Relief, in addition to the 25 million previously announced, to provide a total of approximately 29 million in subsidy to those seeking affordable homeownership. Mortgage Rate Relief is designed to make homeownership attainable for borrowers at or below 80 percent of the area median income, by providing them an interest rate that is approximately two percentage points lower than the current market rate. During the third quarter of 2024, we funded 210 million of loans under this program and recorded 20 million in subsidy expense. During the third quarter of 2024, we launched a new program, the Habitat for Humanity Advance Rate Discount. This program provides up to 100 million in zero percent advances to members that originate or purchase mortgage loans from a Habitat for Humanity affiliate. During the third quarter of 2024, we originated 70 million of zero percent advances and recorded 16 million in subsidy expense. 
 
 Financial Results 
 Our financial condition and results of operations are influenced by global and national economies, local economies within our district, and the conditions in the financial, housing, and credit markets, all of which impact the interest rate environment. The interest rate environment significantly impacts our profitability. In response to higher inflation, the FOMC raised the target range for the federal funds rate throughout 2023, which led to higher interest rates on average during 2024 when compared to the same period last year that affected our net interest income. Refer to Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Conditions in the Financial Markets for additional discussion on economic conditions, including interest rates, impacting our financial results. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded net income of 204 million and 708 million compared to 265 million and 706 million for the same periods in 2023. 
 
 Net interest income decreased 13 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period last year. The decline during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to lower average advance balances, which also reduced earnings on invested capital. The decline was offset in part by improved asset-liability spreads on our investments, driven by higher-yielding MBS purchases. 
 
 Net interest income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 36 million when compared to the same period last year primarily due to higher asset-liability spread resulting largely from higher-yielding MBS purchases and increased longer-term advances, as well as higher short-term interest rates, which improved earnings on invested capital. The increase was partially offset by lower average advance balances.

 Other income (loss) declined 17 million and improved by 10 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same periods last year. The decline in other income (loss) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the net changes in fair value on our trading securities, fair value option instruments, and economic derivatives. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the improvement in other (income) loss was driven by net gains recorded on litigation settlements and increased fees on standby letters of credit. The increase was offset in part by the net changes in fair value on our trading securities, fair value option instruments, and economic derivatives. 
 
 Other expense increased 38 million and 47 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same periods last year. The increase during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by an increase in voluntary community and housing contributions of 35 million and 32 million when compared to the same periods in 2023. Additionally, the increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by higher contract labor and consultant costs. 
 
 Refer to Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations for additional discussion on our results of operations. 
 
 Our total assets decreased to 162.0 billion at September 30, 2024, from 184.4 billion at December 31, 2023, driven primarily by a decline in advances. Advances decreased 23.6 billion mainly due to a decline in borrowings by large depository institution members, offset in part by an increase in borrowings by insurance companies. 
 
 Total capital decreased to 9.3 billion at September 30, 2024 from 9.8 billion at December 31, 2023. Our regulatory capital ratio increased to 5.76 percent at September 30, 2024, from 5.44 percent at December 31, 2023, and remained above the required regulatory limit at each period end. Regulatory capital includes capital stock, MRCS, and retained earnings.

CONDITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS 
 
 Economy and Financial Markets 
 
 Throughout 2023, the FOMC raised the target range for the federal funds rate. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand. Job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation remains somewhat elevated. At its September 2024 meeting, in light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks, the FOMC decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 0.50 percent to 4.75 to 5.00 percent. Further, in its November 2024 meeting, the FOMC reduced the target range for the federal funds rate by an additional 0.25 percent to 4.50 to 4.75 percent, stating that it will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. In addition, the FOMC stated that it will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities, agency debt, and agency MBS.

 Mortgage Markets 
 
 During 2024, mortgage rates were higher, on average, when compared to the same period last year; however, they began to decline in the third quarter of 2024 and decreased from the prior year-end. The primary driver of activity within the mortgage markets was home purchases during 2024 as mortgage rates remained elevated. New home sales increased; however, existing home sales declined relative to the prior year. Home prices have increased in 2024 and prepayment activity increased relative to the same period last year.

The following table presents changes in interest income and interest expense. Changes in interest income and interest expense that are not identifiable as either volume-related or rate-related, but rather attributable to both volume and rate changes, are allocated to the volume and rate categories based on the proportion of the absolute value of the volume and rate changes (dollars in millions).

 Net interest spread represents the annualized yield on total interest-earning assets minus the annualized cost of total interest-bearing liabilities. Our net interest spread increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same periods in 2023 driven primarily by higher-yielding MBS purchases and improvements in market value adjustments on fair value hedge relationships, offset in part by lower net advance prepayment fees. Net interest margin equals net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. Our net interest margin increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same periods in 2023 due primarily to higher net interest spread. Our net interest margin during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was also impacted by increased earnings on invested capital driven by higher short-term interest rates. Refer to Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Overview Financial Results for additional discussion on our net interest income.

 Other income (loss) declined 17 million and improved by 10 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same periods in 2023. We utilize economic derivatives to hedge certain instruments held at fair value that do not qualify for fair value hedge accounting in an effort to manage potential income statement volatility. As a result, we review the related gains (losses) on these items on a net basis. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded net combined losses of 25 million on our trading securities, fair value option instruments, and the related economic derivatives, including the related interest settlements, compared to net combined losses of 1 million for the same period in 2023. The net decrease was primarily driven by changes in interest rates and volumes of fair value option discount notes. The improvement in other income (loss) during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by net gains recorded on litigation settlements and increased fees on standby letters of credit. Refer to Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Hedging Activities for additional discussion on our economic derivatives. 

Hedging Activities 
 
 We use derivatives to manage interest rate risk. Accounting rules affect the timing and recognition of income and expense on derivatives and therefore we may be subject to income statement volatility. If a hedging activity qualifies for hedge accounting treatment (fair value hedge), the net interest settlements of interest receivables or payables related to the derivative are recognized as interest income or expense in the relevant income statement line item consistent with the hedged asset or liability. The net fair value gains and losses of derivatives and hedged items designated in fair value hedge relationships are also recognized as interest income or expense. Amortization of basis adjustments from terminated hedges is also recorded in interest income or expense. 
 
 If a hedging activity does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment (economic hedge), the net interest settlements of interest receivables or payables related to the derivative as well as the fair value gains and losses on the derivative are recorded as a component of other income (loss) in Net gains (losses) on derivatives; however, there is no fair value adjustment for the corresponding asset or liability being hedged unless changes in the fair value of the asset or liability are normally marked to fair value through earnings (i.e., trading securities and fair value option instruments).

Table of Contents 

 NET AMORTIZATION/ACCRETION 
 Net amortization/accretion varies from period to period depending on our hedge relationship termination activities and the maturity, call, or prepayment of assets or liabilities previously in hedge relationships. 
 
 NET GAINS (LOSSES) ON DERIVATIVES AND HEDGED ITEMS 
 
 Net gains and losses on derivatives and hedged items designated in fair value hedge relationships are recorded in net interest income. Gains (losses) on derivatives and hedged items fluctuate with changes in market conditions and are based on a range of factors, including current and projected levels of interest rates and volatility. 
 
 NET INTEREST SETTLEMENTS ON DERIVATIVES 
 
 Net interest settlements represent the interest component on derivatives that qualify for fair value hedge accounting. These amounts vary from period to period depending on our hedging activities and interest rates and are partially offset by the interest component on the related hedged item within net interest income. The hedging activity tables do not include the impact of the interest component on the related hedged item. 
 
 NET GAINS (LOSSES) ON DERIVATIVES 
 
 We utilize economic derivatives to manage certain risks on our Statements of Condition. Gains and losses on economic derivatives include interest settlements. Interest settlements represent the interest component on economic derivatives. These amounts vary from period to period depending on our hedging activities and interest rates. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded net losses of 4 million and 60 million on our economic derivatives, compared to net gains of 17 million and 22 million during the same periods last year. These changes were primarily driven by changes in the interest rate environment.

 Other expense increased 38 million and 47 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same periods last year. The increase during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to an increase in voluntary community and housing contributions of 35 million and 32 million when compared to the same periods in 2023. Additionally, the increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by higher contract labor and consultant costs.

 Our total assets decreased to 162.0 billion at September 30, 2024 from 184.4 billion at December 31, 2023. Our total liabilities decreased to 152.7 billion at September 30, 2024 from 174.6 billion at December 31, 2023. Total capital decreased to 9.3 billion at September 30, 2024 from 9.8 billion at December 31, 2023. See further discussion of changes in our financial condition in the appropriate sections that follow. 

Advances 
 
 The following table summarizes our advances by type of institution (dollars in millions): 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Commercial banks 43,918 75,997 Savings institutions 1,863 1,359 Credit unions 13,715 13,458 Insurance companies 39,241 31,992 CDFIs 10 8 Total member advances 98,747 122,814 Housing associates 172 354 Non-member borrowers 16 53 Total par value 98,935 123,221 
 
 Our total advance par value decreased 24.3 billion or 20 percent at September 30, 2024 when compared to December 31, 2023, primarily due to a decline in borrowings by large depository institution members, offset in part by an increase in borrowings by insurance companies.

 1 Callable advances are those advances that may be contractually prepaid by the borrower on predetermined dates without incurring prepayment or termination fees. Interest rates on our variable rate callable advances reset at each call date to be consistent with either the underlying index or our current offering rate in line with our underlying cost of funds. 
 2 Includes fixed rate amortizing and fixed rate callable advances. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the composition of our advance portfolio shifted to a higher concentration of fixed rate advances, primarily due to called longer-term variable rate advances. Fair value hedging adjustments changed 698 million at September 30, 2024 when compared to December 31, 2023, due primarily to the impact of interest rates on our cumulative fair value adjustments on advances in active hedge relationships.

 4 Consists primarily of taxable municipal bonds. 
 
 Our investments decreased 0.2 billion at September 30, 2024 when compared to December 31, 2023 due primarily to a decline in securities purchased under agreements to resell, partially offset by an increase in federal funds sold and the purchase of U.S. Treasury obligations and agency MBS. At September 30, 2024, we had no investments that were traded but not yet settled. At December 31, 2023, we had agency MBS with a total par value of 692 million that were traded but not yet settled. These investments were recorded as available-for-sale on our Statements of Condition with a corresponding payable recorded in other liabilities. 
 
 The Finance Agency limits our investments in MBS by requiring that the balance of our MBS not exceed three times regulatory capital at the time of purchase. Our ratio of MBS to regulatory capital was 2.58 and 2.35 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 Consolidated Obligations 
 
 Consolidated obligations, which include bonds and discount notes, are the primary source of funds to support our advances, mortgage loans, and investments. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying value of consolidated obligations for which we are primarily liable totaled 150.5 billion and 171.5 billion. 
 
 DISCOUNT NOTES

 Our discount notes increased 4.9 billion or nine percent at September 30, 2024 when compared to December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we continued to utilize discount notes primarily to fund our short-term assets and/or meet our liquidity requirements. Fair value option adjustments changed 63 million at September 30, 2024 when compared to December 31, 2023, driven primarily by the interest rate environment. 
 
 BONDS

Our bonds decreased 25.9 billion or 22 percent at September 30, 2024 when compared to December 31, 2023, driven by a reduction in total assets. Although the balance declined from the prior year-end, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we continued to utilize bonds in an effort to capture attractive funding and/or meet our liquidity requirements. Fair value hedging adjustments changed 138 million at September 30, 2024 when compared to December 31, 2023, driven primarily by volume and the interest rate environment.

 Our capital decreased at September 30, 2024 when compared to December 31, 2023 due primarily to a decrease in activity-based capital stock resulting from a decrease in advance balances, offset in part by an increase in retained earnings. Refer to Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital for additional information on our capital. 

Derivatives 
 
 We use derivatives to manage interest rate risk. The notional amount of derivatives serves as a factor in determining periodic interest payments and cash flows received and paid. However, the notional amount of derivatives represents neither the actual amounts exchanged nor our overall exposure to credit and market risk. 
 
 The following table categorizes the notional amount of our derivatives by type (dollars in millions): 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Interest rate swaps Non-callable 144,456 133,720 Callable by counterparty 10,994 32,284 Total interest rate swaps 155,450 166,004 Forward settlement agreements 216 115 Mortgage loan purchase commitments 213 112 Total notional amount 155,879 166,231 
 
 The notional amount of our derivative contracts decreased 10.4 billion or six percent at September 30, 2024 when compared to December 31, 2023. This was primarily due to a decrease in callable swaps on consolidated obligation bonds, offset in part by increased utilization of non-callable swaps to hedge our advances in an effort to manage our interest rate risk.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Risk Management Credit Risk Derivatives .

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Our liquidity and capital positions are actively managed in an effort to preserve stable, reliable, and cost-effective sources of funds to meet current and projected operating financial commitments, as well as regulatory, liquidity, and capital requirements. 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY 
 
 We utilize several sources of liquidity to carry out our business activities. These include, but are not limited to, proceeds from the issuance of consolidated obligations, payments collected on advances and mortgage loans, proceeds from investment securities, member deposits, proceeds from the issuance of capital stock, and current period earnings. 
 
 Our primary source of liquidity is proceeds from the issuance of consolidated obligations (bonds and discount notes) in the capital markets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, proceeds from the issuance of bonds and discount notes were 35.5 billion and 1,352.2 billion compared to 106.0 billion and 1,328.2 billion for the same periods in 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we increased our utilization of consolidated obligation discount notes relative to bonds in an effort to capture attractive funding and/or meet our liquidity requirements. 
 
 Access to debt markets has been reliable because investors, driven by increased liquidity preference and our GSE status, have sought the FHLBanks debt as an asset of choice. However, due to the short-term maturity of the debt, we may be exposed to additional risks associated with refinancing and our ability to access the capital markets. 
 
 We are focused on maintaining an adequate liquidity balance and a funding balance between our financial assets and financial liabilities and work collectively with the other FHLBanks to manage the system-wide liquidity and funding needs. We monitor our debt refinancing risk and liquidity position primarily by tracking the maturities of financial assets and financial liabilities. In managing and monitoring the amounts of assets that require refunding, we consider contractual maturities of our financial assets and liabilities, as well as certain assumptions regarding expected cash flows (i.e., estimated prepayments). External factors, including member borrowing needs, supply and demand in the debt markets, and other factors may affect liquidity balances and the funding balances between financial assets and financial liabilities. Refer to Item 1. Financial Statements for additional information regarding the contractual maturities of certain of our financial assets and liabilities. 
 
 Our ability to raise funds in the capital markets as well as our cost of borrowing may be affected by our credit ratings. As of October 31, 2024, our consolidated obligations were rated AA+/A-1+ with a stable outlook by S P and Aaa/P-1 with a negative outlook by Moody s. For further discussion of how credit rating changes and our ability to access the capital markets may impact us in the future, refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Although we are primarily liable for the portion of consolidated obligations that are issued on our behalf, we are also jointly and severally liable with the other FHLBanks for the payment of principal and interest on all consolidated obligations issued by the FHLBank System. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total par value of outstanding consolidated obligations for which we are primarily liable was 151.1 billion and 172.2 billion. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total par value of outstanding consolidated obligations issued on behalf of other FHLBanks for which we are jointly and severally liable was 1,021.7 billion and 1,032.1 billion. 
 
 The Office of Finance and FHLBanks have contingency plans in place that prioritize the allocation of proceeds from the issuance of consolidated obligations during periods of financial distress if consolidated obligations cannot be issued in sufficient amounts to satisfy all FHLBank demand. In the event of significant market disruptions or local disasters, our President and CEO or designee is authorized to establish interim borrowing relationships with other FHLBanks. To provide further access to funding, the FHLBank Act also authorizes the U.S. Treasury to directly purchase new issue consolidated obligations of the GSEs, including FHLBanks, up to an aggregate principal amount of 4.0 billion. As of October 31, 2024, no purchases had been made by the U.S. Treasury under this authorization.

Table of Contents 

 USES OF LIQUIDITY 
 
 We use our available liquidity, including proceeds from the issuance of consolidated obligations, primarily to repay consolidated obligations, fund advances, and purchase investments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, repayments of consolidated obligations totaled 1,409.2 billion compared to 1,409.8 billion for the same period in 2023. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, advance disbursements (excluding daily renewals) totaled 311.4 billion compared to 485.1 billion for the same period in 2023. Advance disbursements vary from period to period depending on member needs and decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due primarily to decreased member utilization of short-term advances. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, investment purchases (excluding overnight investments) totaled 5.5 billion compared to 9.3 billion for the same period in 2023, a decrease due primarily to fewer purchases of agency MBS in 2024. 
 
 We also use liquidity to purchase mortgage loans, redeem member deposits, pledge collateral to derivative counterparties, redeem or repurchase capital stock, pay expenses, and pay dividends. 
 
 LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS 
 We are subject to certain liquidity requirements set forth by the Finance Agency and maintain a liquidity contingency funding plan designed to enable us to meet our obligations and the liquidity needs of our members in the event of short-term capital market disruptions, or operational disruptions at our Bank and/or the Office of Finance. For additional details on these liquidity requirements, refer to our 2023 Form 10-K. Our primary liquidity requirement is discussed further below. 
 Liquidity Guidance AB This guidance requires us to maintain sufficient liquidity for a period of 10 to 30 calendar days. The base case scenario requires 20 days of positive daily cash balances and assumes that we cannot access the capital markets to issue debt, and during that time we will automatically renew maturing and called advances for all members, including large, highly-rated members, and we hold additional liquid assets equal to one percent of our letters of credit balances. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with this base case liquidity guidance. 
 The Liquidity Guidance AB also specifies appropriate funding gap limits to address the risks associated with an FHLBank having too large a mismatch between the contractual maturities of its assets and liabilities. A funding gap measures the difference between assets and liabilities that are scheduled to mature during a specified period and is expressed as a percentage of total assets. The guidance provides recommended funding gap maximums of negative 15 percent at the three-month horizon and negative 30 percent at the one-year horizon. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we adhered to these funding gap requirements. 
 Capital 
 
 CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS 
 
 We are subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. First, the FHLBank Act requires that we maintain at all times permanent capital greater than or equal to the sum of our credit, market, and operational risk capital requirements, all calculated in accordance with Finance Agency regulations. Only permanent capital, defined as the amounts paid-in for Class B capital stock (including MRCS), and retained earnings, can satisfy this risk-based capital requirement. Second, the FHLBank Act requires a minimum four percent capital-to-asset ratio, which is defined as total regulatory capital divided by total assets. Total regulatory capital includes Class B capital stock (including MRCS) and retained earnings. Third, the FHLBank Act imposes a five percent minimum leverage ratio, which is defined as the sum of permanent capital weighted 1.5 times and nonpermanent capital weighted 1.0 times, divided by total assets. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we did not hold any nonpermanent capital. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all three of the Finance Agency s regulatory capital requirements. 
 
 In addition to the requirements previously discussed, the Capital Stock AB requires each FHLBank to maintain at all times a ratio of at least two percent of capital stock to total assets. For purposes of the Capital Stock AB, capital stock includes MRCS. The capital stock to total assets ratio is measured on a daily average basis at month end. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with the Capital Stock AB. 
 
 Refer to Item 1. Financial Statements Note 8 Capital for additional information on our regulatory capital requirements.

Table of Contents 

 CAPITAL STOCK 
 Our capital stock has a par value of 100 per share, and all shares are issued, redeemed, and repurchased only at the stated par value. We issue a single class of capital stock (Class B capital stock) and have two subclasses of Class B capital stock: membership and activity-based. Each member must purchase and hold membership capital stock in an amount equal to 0.06 percent of its total assets as of the preceding December 31 st , subject to a cap of 10.0 million and a floor of 10,000. Each member is also required to purchase activity-based capital stock equal to 4.50 percent of its advances, 4.00 percent of mortgage loans outstanding, and 0.10 percent of its standby letters of credit. All Class B capital stock issued is subject to a notice of redemption period of five years. 
 
 The capital stock requirements established in our Capital Plan are designed so that we can remain adequately capitalized as member activity changes. Our Board of Directors may make adjustments to the capital stock requirements within ranges established in our Capital Plan. 
 
 The following table summarizes our regulatory capital stock by type of member (dollars in millions): 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Commercial banks 2,798 4,172 Savings institutions 126 102 Credit unions 958 919 Insurance companies 2,009 1,679 CDFIs 1 1 Total GAAP capital stock 5,892 6,873 MRCS 9 12 Total regulatory capital stock 5,901 6,885 
 
 The decrease in regulatory capital stock held at September 30, 2024 when compared to December 31, 2023 was due primarily to a decrease in activity-based capital stock resulting from a decline in advance balances. For additional information on our capital stock, refer to Item 1. Financial Statements Note 8 Capital . 
 
 Retained Earnings 
 Our risk management policies outline a targeted level of retained earnings based on the amount we believe necessary to help protect the redemption value of capital stock, facilitate safe and sound operations, maintain regulatory capital ratios, and support our ability to pay a relatively stable dividend. We monitor our achievement of this targeted level and may utilize tools such as restructuring our balance sheet, generating additional income, reducing our risk exposures, increasing capital stock requirements, or reducing our dividends to achieve this level of retained earnings. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our actual retained earnings exceeded our targeted level of retained earnings. 
 We entered into a JCE Agreement with all of the other Federal Home Loan Banks in 2011. Under the JCE Agreement, we are required to allocate 20 percent of our quarterly net income to a separate restricted retained earnings account until the balance of that account, calculated as of the last day of each calendar quarter, equals at least one percent of our average balance of outstanding consolidated obligations for the calendar quarter. The restricted retained earnings are not available to pay dividends and are presented separately on our Statements of Condition. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our restricted retained earnings balance totaled 1.0 billion and 0.9 billion. One percent of our average balance of outstanding consolidated obligations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.6 billion. 
 
 Dividends 
 
 Our dividend philosophy is to pay a consistent dividend equal to or greater than the current market rate for a highly-rated investment (i.e. SOFR), and at a rate that the Board of Directors believes is sustainable under current and projected earnings to maintain an appropriate level of capital and retained earnings. Our dividend is determined quarterly by our Board of Directors, based on policies, regulatory requirements, actual performance, and other considerations that the Board of Directors determines to be appropriate.

 Advisory Bulletin on FHLBank Member Credit Risk Management 
 
 On September 27, 2024, the Finance Agency issued an advisory bulletin setting forth the Finance Agency s expectations that an FHLBank s underwriting and credit decisions should reflect a member s financial condition and not rely solely on the collateral securing the member s credit obligations. The advisory bulletin provides guidance for the FHLBanks to implement policies for credit risk governance, member credit assessment and monitoring of credit conditions, among other considerations. It also provides guidance on the oversight of members in financial distress by recommending implementation of escalation policies, processes for coordination with members prudential regulators, and management policies addressing default, failure, and insolvency situations. While we are still evaluating this advisory bulletin against our current member credit risk management policies and procedures to assess its potential impact on us and our operations, we do not expect that this guidance will impact our role as a reliable source of liquidity for our members. 
 
 Advisory Bulletin on Federal Home Loan Bank System Climate-Related Risk Management 
 
 On September 30, 2024, the Finance Agency issued an advisory bulletin setting forth the Finance Agency s expectation that each FHLBank should integrate climate-related risk management into its existing enterprise risk management framework over time. The advisory bulletin provides that an effective framework should address climate-related risk governance, such as selection of the related risk appetite and setting strategy and objectives, establishing and implementing plans to mitigate, monitor, and report material exposures to such risks, and establishing roles and responsibilities for the board of directors and management. The advisory bulletin requires the FHLBanks to establish metrics that track exposure to climate-related risks and collect related data to quantify risk exposures, conduct climate-related scenario analyses, implement processes to report and communicate climate-related risks to internal stakeholders, and have a plan to respond to natural disasters and support climate resiliency. We are evaluating the potential impact of the advisory bulletin on us and our operations.

 Proposed Rule on Unsecured Credit Limits for Federal Home Loan Banks 
 
 On October 3, 2024, the Finance Agency published a proposed rule with a comment deadline of December 2, 2024, to amend the Finance Agency s regulation on capital requirements (Capital Regulation) to modify unsecured credit limits for FHLBanks. The proposed rule would include interest bearing deposit accounts (IBDAs) in a category of authorized overnight investments that would be excluded from the general limit (more restrictive) on unsecured credit to a single counterparty. IBDAs are non-maturity deposits in approved counterparties which may be used to manage liquidity. The proposed rule would, among other things, increase the frequency of the required performance of certain capital calculations and clarify that certain non-interest-bearing deposit accounts (such as settlement, payment or other transactional accounts) are to be considered unsecured extensions of credit subject to the Capital Regulation s unsecured general or overall (less restrictive) limit. Although excluding IBDAs from the general unsecured credit limit could provide greater flexibility for an FHLBank s liquidity management, several of the other proposed changes, if adopted, could result in significant changes to our current business processes. We are evaluating the potential impact of the proposed rule on us and our operations. 
 
 Proposed Rule on Federal Home Loan Bank System Boards of Directors and Executive Management 
 
 On October 21, 2024, the Finance Agency proposed revisions to its regulations addressing boards of directors and overall corporate governance of the FHLBanks and the Office of Finance. The comment deadline will be 90 days after the proposed rule is published in the Federal Register. If adopted as presented, the proposed rule would, among other things: (1) impact director compensation by allowing the Director of the Finance Agency to establish an annual amount of director compensation that the Director determines is reasonable; (2) require us to complete and submit background checks to the Finance Agency on every nominee for a directorship; (3) impact public interest independent director qualifications, in part by requiring a person to have advocated for, or otherwise acted primarily on behalf of or for the direct benefit of, consumers or the community to meet the representation requirement; (4) expand the list of qualifying experiences for all regular independent directors to include artificial intelligence, information technology and security, climate-related risk, Community Development Financial Institutions, business models, and modeling; and (5) establish a review process for director performance and participation, together with a process for removing directors for cause. Other proposed revisions address, among other things, Bank conflicts of interest policies, covering all Bank employees, including specific limitations on executive officers and senior management, and record retention. 
 
 While some proposed revisions would codify existing guidance and practice, several of the proposed revisions could result in significant changes to the nomination, election, and retention of our board of directors. Additional director eligibility requirements and limitations on and potential reductions or limitations to director compensation resulting from the proposed rule could hinder our ability to recruit and retain the talent and expertise that are critical to our ability to satisfy our mission, particularly given the growing complexities of the finance industry. We continue to analyze the impact that the proposed rule could have on us. 

RISK MANAGEMENT 
 
 We have risk management policies, established by our Board of Directors, that allow us to monitor and control our exposure to various risks, including interest rate, liquidity, credit, operational, model, information security, legal, regulatory and compliance, DEI, strategic, and reputational, as well as capital adequacy. Our primary risk management objective is to manage our assets and liabilities in ways that ensure liquidity is available to our members and protect the par redemption value of our capital stock. We periodically evaluate our risk management policies in order to respond to changes in our financial position and general market conditions. The following sections outline our interest rate and credit risks. For additional details on all other risks noted above, please refer to Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Risk Management in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 We define interest rate risk as the risk that changes in interest rates or spreads will adversely affect our financial condition (market value) or performance (income). Interest rate risk is the principal type of risk to which we are exposed, as our cash flows, and therefore earnings and equity value, can change significantly as interest rates change. Our general approach toward managing interest rate risk is to acquire and maintain a portfolio of assets, liabilities, and derivatives which, taken together, limit our expected exposure to interest rate risk. Our key interest rate risk measures are MVE and Projected 24-Month Income. Management regularly monitors these key measures, as discussed further in the sections below. 

57 

Table of Contents 

 MARKET VALUE OF EQUITY 
 
 MVE measures the net present value of the Bank by either marking positions to market or discounting all future cash flows using market discount rates. MVE is measured as the market value of our assets minus the market value of our liabilities (excluding MRCS). MVE is an estimate of the Bank s value and takes into account short-term market price fluctuations. 
 
 We monitor and manage to MVE policy limits in an effort to ensure the stability of the Bank s value. Our policy limits are based on declines from the base case in parallel and non-parallel interest rate change scenarios. Any policy limit breach must be reported to the Enterprise Risk Committee of the Bank and the Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors and be remediated in a timely manner. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our base case MVE was 9.1 billion and 9.7 billion, and the decline between periods was primarily due to a decrease in activity-based stock resulting from a decline in advance balances. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all MVE policy limits. 
 
 MVCS represents our MVE divided by the total outstanding shares of our capital stock (including MRCS). To ensure we remain adequately capitalized, we must ensure our MVCS remains at or above our 100 par value. Our base case MVCS was 154.3 at September 30, 2024 compared to 141.6 at December 31, 2023. The increase in our base case MVCS was primarily attributable to the redemption of activity-based capital stock at par value, which is below our current MVCS value. 
 
 For more information on this risk measure, including policy limits, refer to Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Risk Management Interest Rate Risk Market Value of Equity in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 PROJECTED 24-MONTH INCOME 
 
 The projected 24-month income simulation measures our short-term earnings forecast over a two-year horizon based on forward interest rates and business assumptions. Our primary measure of profitability is the spread between projected AROCS and average SOFR. In this measure, AROCS adjusts GAAP net income for certain non-routine or unpredictable items, including, but not limited to, market adjustments relating to derivative and hedging activities and instruments held at fair value, net asset prepayment fee income, MRCS interest expense, debt extinguishment gains (losses), and (ii) other non-routine items, if applicable. 
 
 We monitor and manage to policy limits, which are based on the spread between our projected AROCS and average SOFR in parallel and non-parallel interest rate change scenarios. Additionally, there is a limit on the decline in projected AROCS from base case AROCS for certain basis shock scenarios to limit basis risk exposure. Any policy limit breach must be reported to the Enterprise Risk Committee of the Bank and the Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors and be remediated in a timely manner. We were in compliance with all projected 24-month income policy limits at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 For more information on this risk measure, including policy limits, refer to Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Risk Management Interest Rate Risk Projected 24-Month Income in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 CAPITAL ADEQUACY 
 
 An adequate capital position is necessary for facilitating safe and sound business operations, protecting the redemption value of our capital stock, maintaining regulatory capital ratios, and supporting our ability to pay dividends and redeem excess capital stock. To ensure capital adequacy, we maintain a targeted level of retained earnings to achieve business imperatives and cover unexpected losses. Our key capital adequacy measures are regulatory capital and targeted retained earnings in order to maintain capital levels in accordance with Finance Agency regulations. In addition, our risk management policies require that we maintain MVCS at or above our 100 par value. 
 
 For additional information on our compliance with regulatory capital requirements as well as our targeted retained earnings, refer to Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital.

 Credit Risk 
 
 We define credit risk as the risk that a member or counterparty will fail to meet its financial obligations. Our primary credit risks arise from our ongoing lending, investing, and hedging activities. Our overall objective in managing credit risk is to operate a sound credit granting process and to maintain appropriate credit administration, measurement, and monitoring practices. 
 
 ADVANCES 
 
 We manage our credit exposure to advances through a lending policy that provides for an established credit limit for each borrower, ongoing reviews of each borrower s financial condition and ability to repay, and detailed collateral and lending policies to limit risk of loss while balancing borrowers needs for a reliable source of funding. In addition, we lend to our borrowers in accordance with the FHLBank Act, Finance Agency regulations, and other applicable laws. 
 
 We are required by regulation to evaluate our members creditworthiness and ability to repay, and to obtain sufficient collateral to fully secure our advances, standby letters of credit, and other extensions of credit to borrowers (collectively, credit products). The estimated value of the collateral required to secure each borrower s credit products is calculated by applying collateral discounts, or haircuts, to the unpaid principal or market value, as applicable, of the collateral. We also have policies and procedures for validating the reasonableness of our collateral valuations. In addition, we perform collateral verifications and on-site reviews based on the risk profile of the borrower. Management believes that these policies effectively manage our credit risk from advances. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, borrowers pledged 399.1 billion and 380.7 billion of collateral (net of applicable discounts) to support activity with us, including advances. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all of our advances met the requirement to be collateralized at a minimum of 100 percent, net of applicable discounts. Borrowers pledge collateral in excess of their collateral requirement mainly to demonstrate available liquidity and to borrow additional amounts in the future. 
 
 We evaluate advances for credit losses on a quarterly basis. We have never experienced a credit loss on our advances. Based upon our collateral and lending policies, the collateral held as security, and the repayment history on advances, management has determined that there were no expected credit losses on our advances as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Refer to Item 1. Financial Statements Note 4 Advances for additional information on our allowance for credit losses. 
 
 MORTGAGE LOANS 
 
 Mortgage loan credit risk is the risk that we will not receive timely payments of principal and interest due from mortgage borrowers because of borrower defaults. Credit risk on mortgage loans is affected by a number of factors, including loan type, borrower s credit history, and other factors such as home price fluctuations, unemployment levels, and other economic factors in the local market or nationwide. 
 
 The following table presents the unpaid principal balance of our mortgage loans by product type (dollars in millions): 
 Product Type September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Conventional 10,942 9,506 Government 371 378 Total unpaid principal balance 11,313 9,884 
 
 We manage the credit risk on mortgage loans by (i) adhering to our underwriting standards, (ii) using agreements to establish credit risk sharing responsibilities with our PFIs, and (iii) monitoring the performance of the mortgage loan portfolio and creditworthiness of PFIs. 
 
 We evaluate mortgage loans for credit losses on a quarterly basis and establish an allowance for credit losses to reflect management s estimate of expected credit losses inherent in the portfolio. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had an allowance for credit losses of 4 million and 6 million on our conventional mortgage loans. At September 30, 2024, over 99 percent of our conventional loan portfolio was performing (i.e. current payment status) and charge-offs recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were less than one percent of the total conventional portfolio.

 We have never experienced a credit loss on our government-insured mortgage loans. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we determined no allowance for credit losses was necessary on our government-insured mortgage loans. Refer to Item 1. Financial Statements Note 5 Mortgage Loans Held for Portfolio for additional information on our allowance for credit losses and the payment status of our conventional mortgage loans. 
 
 INVESTMENTS 
 
 We maintain an investment portfolio primarily to provide liquidity as well as investment income. Our primary credit risk on investments is the counterparties ability to meet repayment terms. We mitigate this credit risk by purchasing investment quality securities. We define investment quality as a security with adequate financial backing so that full and timely payment of principal and interest on such security is expected and there is minimal risk that the timely payment of principal and interest would not occur because of adverse changes in economic and financial conditions during the projected life of the security. We consider a variety of credit quality factors when analyzing potential investments, including collateral performance, marketability, asset class or sector considerations, local and regional economic conditions, NRSRO credit ratings, and/or the financial health of the underlying issuer. We limit our purchases of MBS to those guaranteed by the U.S. Government or issued by a GSE. We perform ongoing analysis on these investments to determine potential credit issues. 
 
 Finance Agency regulations also limit the type of investments we may purchase. We are prohibited from investing in financial instruments issued by non-U.S. entities other than those issued by U.S. branches and agency offices of foreign commercial banks, unless otherwise approved by the Finance Agency. At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the regulation and did not own any financial instruments issued by non-U.S. entities, other than those issued by U.S. branches and agency offices of foreign commercial banks, and those approved by the Finance Agency. 
 
 In addition, Finance Agency regulations include limits on the amount of unsecured credit we may extend to a counterparty or to a group of affiliated counterparties. These limits are based on a percentage of regulatory capital and the counterparty s overall credit rating. At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the regulatory limits established for unsecured credit. 
 
 Refer to Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Risk Management Credit Risk in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information on these regulatory limits. 
 
 Our short-term portfolio may include, but is not limited to, interest-bearing deposits, federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and U.S. Treasury obligations. Our long-term portfolio may include, but is not limited to, U.S. Treasury obligations, other U.S. obligations, GSE and TVA obligations, state or local housing agency obligations, taxable municipal bonds, and agency MBS. We consider our long-term investments issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, an agency or instrumentality of the U.S. Government, or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to be of the highest credit quality and therefore those exposures are not monitored with other unsecured investments. Given the credit quality of our unsecured long-term investments, our unsecured credit risk is primarily in the short-term portfolio. 
 
 We limit short-term unsecured credit exposure primarily to the following overnight investment types: 
 
 Interest-bearing deposits. Primarily consists of unsecured deposits that earn interest. 
 
 Federal funds sold. Unsecured loans of reserve balances at the Federal Reserve Banks between financial institutions. 
 
 Commercial paper. Unsecured debt issued by corporations, typically for the financing of accounts receivable, inventories, and meeting short-term liabilities.

 We evaluate investments for credit losses on a quarterly basis. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we determined no allowance for credit losses was necessary on our investments. Refer to Item 1. Financial Statements Note 3 Investments for additional information on our allowance for credit losses. 
 
 DERIVATIVES 
 
 We execute most of our derivative transactions with large banks and major broker-dealers. Over-the-counter derivative transactions may be either executed directly with a counterparty, referred to as uncleared derivatives, or cleared through a clearing agent with a clearinghouse, referred to as cleared derivatives. 
 
 We are subject to credit risk due to the risk of nonperformance by counterparties to our derivative agreements. The amount of credit risk on derivatives depends on the extent to which netting procedures and collateral requirements are used and are effective in mitigating the risk. We manage credit risk through credit analysis of derivative counterparties, collateral requirements, and adherence to the requirements set forth in our policies, CFTC regulations, and Finance Agency regulations. 
 
 Uncleared derivative transactions executed on or after September 1, 2022 are subject to two-way initial margin requirements as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, if our aggregate uncleared derivative transactions exposure to a counterparty exceeds a specified threshold. The initial margin is required to be held at a third-party custodian and does not change ownership. Rather, the party in respect of which the initial margin has been posted to the third-party custodian will have a security interest in the amount of initial margin required under the uncleared margin rules and can only take ownership upon the occurrence of certain events, including an event of default due to bankruptcy, insolvency, or similar proceeding. As of October 31, 2024, we were not required to post initial margin on our uncleared derivative transactions in accordance with the noted regulations. 
 
 For uncleared transactions, the derivative agreements are generally fully collateralized with a zero unsecured threshold in accordance with variation margin requirements issued by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies and the CFTC. 
 
 The contractual or notional amount of derivatives reflects our involvement in the various classes of financial instruments. Our maximum credit risk is the estimated cost of replacing derivatives if there is a default, minus the value of any related collateral. In determining maximum credit risk, we consider accrued interest receivables and payables as well as our ability to net settle positive and negative positions with the same counterparty and/or clearing agent when netting requirements are met.
