as of August 31, 2024. The Company requires
capital for its contemplated operational and marketing activities. The Company s ability to raise additional capital through the
future issuances of common stock is unknown. The obtainment of additional financing, the successful development of the Company s
contemplated plan of operations, and its transition, ultimately, to the attainment of profitable operations are necessary for the Company
to continue operations. These conditions and the ability to successfully resolve these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments that may result from the
outcome of these uncertainties.

conditions or events that may raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern, there are no assurances that any
of these measures will successfully mitigate or be effective at all. (1) The Company shall pursue financing plans to raise funds to judiciously

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Anvi Global Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in the
State of Nevada on August 15, 2012 and established a fiscal year end of February 28. We formed the Company to commence operations in the
business of selling crepes; however, we abandoned that business when control of the Company was sold by Tatiana Fumioka, on May 6, 2014.
As a result, we are now controlled by Rama Mohan R. Busa, the principal shareholder and sole officer and director. 

Anvi Global Holdings, Inc now intends to become a
diversified, global holdings company with interest in a suite of businesses in various key segments, including mining, infrastructure,
heavy earthworks, health services and aerospace engineering, positioned globally. The Company s objective is to maximize shareholder
value through investing in and/or acquiring a portfolio of companies in emerging global markets like India, South America and Africa,
adding value to the operating enterprises. The Company plans to invest in or acquire businesses which offer strategic market position,
strong cash flows and robust future potential growth, which are complementary to each other. The Company intends to broaden and intensify
positions in carefully selected investment areas and is poised to have strong presence across these countries. As of the date of this
Report, the Company has not invested in or acquired any assets or company. 

Results of Operations 

The three months ended August 31, 2024 compared to the three months
ended August 31, 2023 

Operating Expenses 

 General and administrative expenses were 51,012 for
the three months ended August 31, 2024, compared to 52,365 the three months ended August 31, 2023, a decrease of 1,353 or 2.6 . In the
current period, we incurred 36,000 of expense from our service agreement with Strategic-IT Group Inc. (Note 5), professional fees of
 9,600, OTC Market fees of 3,900 and other general expenses of 1,512. In the prior period, we incurred 36,000 of expense from our service
agreement with Strategic-IT Group Inc. (Note 5), professional fees of 6,411, OTC Market fees of 3,750 and other general expenses of
 6,204. 

Net Loss 

 Our net loss for the three months ended August 31,
2024 was 51,012 compared to 52,365 for the three months ended August 31, 2023. 

The six months ended August 31, 2024 compared to the six months ended
August 31, 2023 

Operating Expenses 

 General and administrative expenses were 106,109
for the six months ended August 31, 2024, compared to 106,043 the six months ended August 31, 2023, an increase of only 66 or 0.1 .
In the current period, we incurred 72,000 of expense from our service agreement with Strategic-IT Group Inc. (Note 5), professional fees
of 23,200, OTC Market fees of 7,800 and other general expenses of 3,109. In the prior period, we incurred 36,000 of expense from our

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 

 For the six-month period ended August 31, 2024, net
cash flows used in operating activities was 27,508 compared to 35,433 used by operating activities in the prior period 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 

 For the six-month period ended August 31, 2024 and
2023, our CEO advanced the Company 29,100 and 34,085, respectively. 

Plan of Operation and Funding 

We have no lines of credit or other bank financing
arrangements capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. If and when we commence any operations, additional
issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might
have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or
at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective
new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. 

We do not currently engage in enough business activities
that provide cash flow. During the next twelve months we anticipate incurring costs related to: 

(i) 
 filing of Exchange Act reports, and 

(ii) 
 costs relating to developing our business plan 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

None. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period
covered by this quarterly report, August 31, 2024. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of
our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. 

Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and
other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our company s reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated
to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Based upon that evaluation, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of the end of the
period covered by this report due to a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, which is described below. 

Management s Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).
Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2024, based on criteria using
the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
As a result of this assessment, management concluded that, as of August 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was not
effective. Our management identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which are indicative
of many small companies with small staff: (i) inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk assessment; and (ii) insufficient written
policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of both US GAAP and SEC
guidelines. 

We plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design
of our internal control over financial reporting. During the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, we have not been able
to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To remediate such weaknesses, we hope to implement the following changes during
our fiscal year ending February 28, 2025: (i) appoint additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective
risk management; and (ii) adopt sufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting. The remediation efforts
set out in (i) and (ii) are largely dependent upon our securing additional financing to cover the costs of implementing the changes required.
If we are unsuccessful in securing such funds, remediation efforts may be adversely affected in a material manner. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control over
financial reporting during the quarter ended August 31, 2024, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.
