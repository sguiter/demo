CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and as such are not historical facts. This includes, without limitation, statements regarding our financial position and business strategy, and the plans and objectives of management for our future operations. Such statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. When used in this report, words such as anticipate, believe, continue, could, estimate, expect, intend, may, might, plan, possible, potential, predict, project, should, strive, would, and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are predictions, projections, and other statements about future events that are based on current expectations and assumptions and, as a result, are subject to risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual future events to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this report, including, but not limited to: 
 our ability to attract new subscribers and to persuade existing subscribers to renew their subscription agreements with us and to purchase additional products and services from us; 
 our ability to adequately market our products and services, and to develop additional products and product offerings; 
 our ability to manage our growth effectively, including through acquisitions; 
 failure to maintain and protect our reputation for trustworthiness and independence; 
 our ability to attract, develop, and retain capable management, editors, and other key personnel; 
 our ability to grow market share in our existing markets or any new markets we may enter; 
 adverse or weakened conditions in the financial sector, global financial markets, and global economy; 
 current macroeconomic events, including heightened inflation, rise in interest rates and the potential for an economic recession; 
 failure to comply with laws and regulations or other regulatory action or investigations, including the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the Advisers Act 
 our ability to respond to and adapt to changes in technology and consumer behavior; 
 failure to successfully identify and integrate acquisitions, or dispose of assets and businesses; 
 our public securities potential liquidity and trading; 
 the impact of the regulatory environment and complexities with compliance related to such environment; 
 our future capital needs; 
 our ability to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting; 
 our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property; and 
 other factors detailed under the section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 entitled Risk Factors. 
 These forward-looking statements are based on information available as of the date of this report and current expectations, forecasts, and assumptions, and involve a number of judgments, risks, and uncertainties. Additionally, as a result of a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties, our actual results or performance may be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date, and we do not

undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements for any reason, except as may be required under applicable securities laws.

Emerging Growth Company 
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ), and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 
 Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our unaudited condensed financial statements with another public company that is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company that has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. Certain provisions of the JOBS Act are set to expire on December 31, 2025. 
 Net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was attributable to consolidated MarketWise, Inc. and its respective noncontrolling interests. 
 As of September 30, 2024, MarketWise, Inc. s controlling interest in MarketWise, LLC was and the noncontrolling interest was . For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net income attributable to controlling interests included a tax provision, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net income attributable to controlling interests included a tax provision, both of which were solely attributable to the controlling interest.

 2021 Incentive Award Plan 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we granted restricted stock units RSUs to certain employees and service providers in aggregate under our 2021 Incentive Award Plan. 
 For employees and service providers, both RSUs and stock appreciation rights SARs are primarily time-based and typically vest ratably over , as specified in the individual grant notices. The RSUs may entitle the recipients to dividend equivalents if approved by the Plan Administrator, which are subject to the same vesting terms and accumulate during the vesting period. Upon vesting, the RSU holder will be issued a corresponding number of the Company s Class A common stock. The SARs will be settled in the Company s Class A common stock upon exercise. The shares to be issued upon exercise of a SAR will have a total market value equal to the SAR value calculated as (x) number of shares underlying such SAR, multiplied by (y) any excess of the Company s share value on the date of exercise over the exercise price set in each individual grant notice. 
 The fair value of the RSU is the same as the Company s share price on the date of grant. The fair value of the SARs was determined using a Black-Scholes model.

 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The main driver of the effective income tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was the income allocation to the non-controlling interest. The main driver of the decrease in the effective tax rate from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 is the change in the income allocation to the non-controlling interest. Our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily because we generally do not record income taxes for the non-controlling portion of pre-tax income. 
 As a result of Transactions, we recorded a deferred tax asset resulting from the outside basis difference in our interest in MarketWise, LLC. The Company considers both positive and negative evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance. A valuation allowance is not required to the extent that, in management s judgment, positive evidence exists with a magnitude and duration sufficient to result in a conclusion that it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50 that the Company s deferred tax assets will be realized. 
 In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset, the company considered positive evidence related to its historic earnings, forecasted income and reversal of temporary differences. Therefore, the Company recorded a valuation allowance in the amount of for certain deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized. 
 As part of Transactions, we entered into Tax Receivable Agreements TRAs with certain shareholders. Pursuant to our election under Section 754 of the Code, as amended, and the regulations issued thereunder, we expect to receive a step up in the tax basis of our ownership in MarketWise, LLC as exchanges of the LLC Units (as defined herein) occur. These increases in tax basis may reduce the amount we may otherwise pay to various tax authorities in the future. The TRA liability will represent approximately of the calculated tax savings based on basis adjustments and other carryforward attributes assumed that we anticipate to be able to utilize in future years. We will retain the remaining of calculated tax savings. The payments contemplated by the TRA are not conditioned upon any continued ownership interest in MarketWise, LLC. The timing and amount of aggregate payments due pursuant to the TRA may vary based on several factors including the timing and amount of future taxable income, as well as future applicable tax rates. As such, significant inputs and assumptions are used to estimate the future expected payments under the TRA. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Members of MarketWise, LLC exchanged an aggregate of common units of MarketWise, LLC LLC Units together with an equal number of shares of Class B common stock for newly-issued shares of Class A common stock. As a result, we have recorded a cumulative liability of under the TRA as of September 30, 2024. No payments have been made under the TRA and no payments are expected in the next 12 months. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had unrecognized tax positions and we do not anticipate any changes to uncertain tax positions within the next 12 months.

 Key Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 We believe that our growth and future success are dependent upon several factors, including those below and those noted in the Risk Factors section in the Annual Report. The key factors below represent significant business opportunities as well as challenges that we must successfully address in order to continue our growth and improve our financial results. 
 Growing our subscriber base with compelling unit economics. We are highly focused on continuing to acquire new subscribers to support our long-term growth. Our marketing spend is a large driver of new subscriber growth. At the heart of our marketing strategy is our compelling unit economics that combine long-term subscriber relationships, highly scalable content delivery, cost-effective customer acquisition, and high-margin conversions. 
 Our Paid Subscribers (as defined below) as of December 31, 2023 generated average customer lifetime Billings of approximately 1,494, resulting in a LTV/CAC (as defined below) ratio of approximately 2.3x. On average, it takes us approximately 1.1 to 1.6 years for a Paid Subscriber s cumulative net revenue to exceed the total cost of acquiring that subscriber (which includes fixed costs, such as marketing salaries). For more information on Billings and our LTV/CAC ratio and the components of this ratio, see Key Business Metrics and Definitions of Metrics, respectively. 
 We adjust our marketing spend to drive efficient and profitable customer acquisition. We can adjust our marketing spend in near real-time, and we monitor costs per acquisition relative to the cart value of the initial subscription. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our Paid Subscriber base was 592 thousand, down 182 thousand, or 23.5 as compared to 774 thousand at September 30, 2023. Our Paid Subscriber base is comprised of subscribers obtained through both direct-to-paid acquisition and free-to-paid conversions. Since 2019, direct-to-paid acquisition has accounted for approximately 60 of our annual Paid Subscriber acquisition and is largely driven by display ads and targeted email campaigns. 
 Our free subscription products also serve as a significant source of new Paid Subscribers, accounting for approximately 40 of our annual Paid Subscriber acquisition. 
 Retaining and expanding relationships with existing subscribers. We believe that we have a significant opportunity to expand our relationships with our large base of Free and Paid Subscribers. Thanks to the quality of our products, we believe our customers will continue their relationship with us and extend and increase their subscriptions over time. As we deepen our engagement with our subscribers, our customers tend to purchase more and higher-value products. Our ARPU (as defined below) as of September 30, 2024 was 417, which 
 32 

decreased 15.9 from 496 as of September 30, 2023. For more information on ARPU, see Key Business Metrics Average Revenue Per User. 
 Conversion rates are important to our business because they are an indicator of how engaged and how well we are connecting with our subscribers. The time it takes our customers to move from our free products to our lower-priced paid subscriptions and eventually to high-end products and membership bundled offerings impacts our growth in net revenue, Billings, and ARPU. 
 Our high-value composition rate reflects the rate at which Paid Subscribers that have purchased less than 600 of our products over their lifetime convert into subscribers that have purchased more than 600. We believe our high-value composition rate reflects our ability to retain existing subscribers through renewals and our ability to expand our relationship with them when those subscribers purchase higher-value subscriptions. Our cumulative ultra high-value composition rate reflects the rate at which high value Paid Subscribers that have purchased more than 600 of our products over their lifetime convert into subscribers that have purchased more than 5,000. We believe our ultra high-value composition rate reflects our ability to successfully build lifetime relationships with our subscribers, often across multiple products and brands. As of September 30, 2024, 52 of our Paid Subscribers were high-value subscribers and 22 of our Paid Subscribers were ultra high-value subscribers. 
 
 Definitions of Metrics 
 Throughout this discussion and analysis, a number of our financial and operating metrics are referenced which we do not consider to be key business metrics, but which we review to monitor performance, and which we believe may be useful to investors. These are: 
 Annual free-to-paid and annual active free-to-paid conversion rates: The Company has historically defined free-to-paid conversion rate as the number of Free Subscribers (as defined below) who purchased a subscription during the period divided by the average number of Free Subscribers during the period. In addition, the Company has historically defined active free-to-paid conversion rate as the number of Active Free Subscribers (as defined below) who purchased a subscription during the period divided by the average number of Active Free Subscribers during the period. There have been no changes to the calculation of free-to-paid or active free-to-paid conversion rates. However, the Company has revised the definition of free-to-paid and active free-to-paid conversion rates to provide clarity in how they are calculated. 
 We calculate our free-to-paid conversion rate as the sum of (i) the number of Free Subscribers who purchased their first subscription during the period and (ii) the number of Free Subscribers who purchased their first subscription during the period after six months of not having an active paid subscription across all of MarketWise divided by the average number of Free Subscribers during the period. We calculate our active free-to-paid conversion rate as the sum of (i) the number of Active Free Subscribers who purchased their first subscription during the period and (ii) the number of Active Free Subscribers who purchased their first subscription during the period after six months of not having an active paid subscription across all of MarketWise divided by the average number of Active Free Subscribers during the period. We believe our free-to-paid and active free-to-paid conversion rates are indicators of the type of Free Subscribers that we are signing up and the quality of our content and marketing efforts. Investors should consider free-to-paid and active free-to-paid conversion rates as two of the factors in evaluating our ability to maintain a robust pipeline for new customer acquisition. 
 Cumulative free-to-paid and cumulative active free-to-paid conversion rates: We calculate our cumulative free-to-paid conversion rate as the sum of (i) the number of Free Subscribers who purchased their first subscription during the trailing three-year period and (ii) the number of Free Subscribers who purchased their first subscription during the trailing three-year period after six months of not having an active paid subscription across all of MarketWise divided by the average number of Free Subscribers during the trailing three-year period. We calculate our cumulative active free-to-paid conversion rate as the sum of (i) the number of Active Free Subscribers who purchased their first subscription during the trailing three-year period and (ii) the number of Active Free Subscribers who purchased their first subscription during the trailing three-year period after six 
 33 

months of not having an active paid subscription across all of MarketWise divided by the average number of Active Free Subscribers during the trailing three-year period. 
 High-value composition rate: Our high-value composition rate reflects the number of Paid Subscribers who have purchased > 600 in aggregate over their lifetime as of a particular point in time divided by the total number of Paid Subscribers as of that same point in time. 
 LTV/CAC ratio: We calculate LTV/CAC ratio as LTV divided by CAC. We use LTV/CAC ratio because it is a standard metric for subscription-based businesses, and we believe that an LTV/CAC ratio above 3x is considered to be indicative of strong profitability and marketing efficiency. We believe that an increasing LTV per subscriber reflects our existing subscribers recognizing our value proposition, which will expand their relationship with us across our platform over time, either through a combination of additional product purchases or by joining our membership offerings. Investors should consider this metric when evaluating our ability to achieve a return on our marketing investment. Lifetime value LTV represents the average margin on average customer lifetime Billings (that is, the estimated cumulative spend across a customer s lifetime). Customer acquisition cost CAC is defined as direct marketing spend, plus external revenue share expense, plus retention and renewal expenses, plus copywriting and marketing salaries, plus telesales salaries and commissions, plus customer service commissions. 
 Net revenue retention: Net revenue retention is defined as Billings from all prior period cohorts in the current period, divided by all Billings from the prior period. We believe that a high net revenue retention rate is a measure of customer retention and an indicator of the engagement of our subscribers with our products. Investors should consider net revenue retention as an ongoing measure when evaluating our subscribers interest in continuing to subscribe to our products and spending more with us over time. 
 Ultra high-value composition rate: Our ultra high-value composition rate reflects the number of Paid Subscribers who have purchased > 5,000 in aggregate over their lifetime as of a particular point in time divided by the number of high-value subscribers as of that same point in time. We believe our ultra high-value composition rate reflects our ability to successfully build lifetime relationships with our subscribers, often across multiple products and brands. Investors should consider ultra high-value composition rate as a factor in evaluating our ability to retain and expand our relationship with our subscribers. 

Key Business Metrics 
 We review the following key business metrics to measure our performance, identify trends, formulate financial projections, and make strategic decisions. We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating these key 
 34 

metrics, which may hinder comparability with other companies who may calculate similarly titled metrics in a different way.

 Free Subscribers. Free Subscribers are defined as unique subscribers who have subscribed to one of our free investment publications via a valid email address and continue to remain directly opted in, excluding any Paid Subscribers who also have free subscriptions. Free subscriptions are often daily publications that include some commentary about the stock market, investing ideas, or other specialized topics. Included within our free publications are advertisements and editorial support for our current marketing campaigns. While subscribed to our publications, Free Subscribers learn about our editors and analysts, get to know our products and services, and learn more about ways we can help them be a better investor. 
 In order to better describe our universe of Free Subscribers, we recognize sub-categories of Free Subscribers Active and Passive Free Subscribers. Active Free Subscribers are those Free Subscribers with whom we have engaged during the most recent quarter and represent those individuals who have received and/or consumed our content on a regular basis during that same quarter. Our experience indicates that this population of Active Free Subscribers is more likely to continue to consume content and convert to a Paid Subscriber. Passive Free Subscribers represent those individuals who have not directly received our content during the most recent quarter, however, they remain included in our Free Subscriber population as defined above and may continue to consume content from our platforms. We expect the composition of our Active and Passive Free Subscribers will change over time as we refine our marketing and data analysis techniques aimed at converting Free Subscribers to Paid Subscribers. 
 We have determined that Free Subscribers provide less meaningful insight into the current or future state of our business as many of these Subscribers have limited engagement with our content. As discussed above, our Active Free Subscribers, with whom we ve engaged during the most recent quarter, are most likely to continue to consume content and convert to a Paid Subscriber. We will continue to report Free and Active Free Subscribers throughout 2024. Beginning with first quarter 2025, we will discontinue reporting Free Subscribers and only report Active Free Subscribers. 
 Free Subscribers decreased by 1.0 million, or 6.4 , to 15.3 million as of September 30, 2024 as compared to 16.3 million at September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, Active Free Subscribers decreased by 0.7 million, or 17.5 , to 3.3 million, compared to 4.0 million as of September 30, 2023. The year over year decline in Free Subscribers is a result of more aggressive culling of the most passive Free Subscribers as we move towards implementation of the change described above. The year over year decrease in Active Free Subscribers 
 35 

is a result of both fewer free subscribers in total as well as a reduced number of free products available as we rationalize our offerings. 
 Free Subscribers decreased by 0.1 million, or 0.4 to 15.3 million as of September 30, 2024 as compared to 15.2 million as of June 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, Active Free Subscribers decreased by 1.5 million, or 31.7 to 3.3 million, compared to 4.8 million as of June 30, 2024, as the prior quarter saw us reach out to previously passive Legacy Research Free Subscribers to notify them that their subscriptions were transferred over to like subscriptions in other brands within MarketWise. 
 Paid Subscribers. We define Paid Subscribers as the total number of unique subscribers with at least one paid subscription at the end of the period. We view the number of Paid Subscribers at the end of a given period as a key indicator of the attractiveness of our products and services, as well as the efficacy of our marketing in converting Free Subscribers to Paid Subscribers and generating direct-to-paid acquisitions. We grow our Paid Subscriber base through marketing directly to prospective and existing subscribers across a variety of media, channels, and platforms. 
 Total Paid Subscribers decreased by 182 thousand, or 23.5 , to 592 thousand as of September 30, 2024 as compared to 774 thousand at September 30, 2023, driven by continued soft consumer engagement as well as a significant decrease in marketing spend as we continue to manage profitability. This decrease in marketing spend limits the new subscribers that we introduce to our offerings. 
 Total Paid Subscribers decreased by 53 thousand, or 8.2 , to 592 thousand as of September 30, 2024 as compared to 645 thousand as of June 30, 2024. Gross new subscribers were down 15 thousand or 58 compared to second quarter 2024 as a result of decreased marketing spend. Churn levels within the quarter were in line with the historical average. 
 Subscriber count churn has ranged from approximately 2.3 to 2.7 per month between 2021 and 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the average monthly churn over the trailing twelve months was slightly above this range due to the ongoing churn of previous Legacy Research subscribers. Almost all of the subscribers who churned in second quarter 2024 did so having owned only one entry level publication. This is evidenced by the fact that their ARPU approximately matched the subscription price of our entry level publications. We believe our net revenue retention rate, which has averaged over 70 from 2021 to 2023, is a more meaningful gauge of subscriber satisfaction. 
 Average Revenue Per User. We calculate ARPU as the trailing four quarters of net Billings divided by the average number of quarterly total Paid Subscribers over that period. We believe ARPU is a key indicator of how successful we are in attracting subscribers to higher-value content. We believe that our high ARPU is indicative of the trust we build with our subscribers and of the value they see in our products and services. 
 ARPU decreased by 79, or 15.9 , to 417 as of September 30, 2024 as compared to 496 as of September 30, 2023. The year-over-year decrease was driven by a 29 decrease in trailing four quarter Billings, while trailing four quarter Paid Subscribers only decreased by 15 . The decrease in trailing four quarter Billings was largely driven by cessation of selling to our Legacy Research subscribers as further discussed in Billings below. 
 ARPU decreased by 39, or 8.5 , to 417 as of September 30, 2024 as compared to 456 as of June 30, 2024. The sequential decrease was driven by a 14 decrease in trailing four-quarter Billings, while trailing four-quarter average Paid Subscribers only decreased 6 . 
 While they have declined somewhat recently, our ARPUs remain high relative to other subscription businesses, and we attribute this to the quality of our content and effective sales and marketing efforts regarding higher value content, bundled subscriptions and membership subscriptions. These subscriptions have compelling economics that allow us to recoup our initial marketing spend made to acquire these subscribers. Specifically, our payback period was estimated at 1.5 years, 1.5 years, and 0.9 years for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our payback period remains elevated primarily due to a combination of increased customer acquisition costs and the hesitancy of these subscribers to make additional 
 36 

purchases. The payback period was lower in 2021 with conversion rates still relatively high and, to a far lesser degree, lower costs for media spend as demand was somewhat constrained as the pandemic lingered. 
 Billings. Billings represents amounts invoiced to customers. We measure and monitor our Billings because it provides insight into trends in cash generation from our marketing campaigns. We generally bill our subscribers at the time of sale and receive full cash payment up front and defer and recognize a portion of the related revenue ratably over time for term and membership subscriptions. For certain subscriptions, we may invoice our Paid Subscribers at the beginning of the term, in annual or monthly installments, and, from time to time, in multi-year installments. Only amounts invoiced to a Paid Subscriber in a given period are included in Billings. While we believe that Billings provides valuable insight into the cash that will be generated from sales of our subscriptions, this metric may vary from period to period for a number of reasons and, therefore, Billings has a number of limitations as a quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year comparative measure. These reasons include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) a variety of contractual terms could result in some periods having a higher proportion of annual or membership subscriptions than other periods; (ii) fluctuations in payment terms may affect the Billings recognized in a particular period; and (iii) the timing of large campaigns may vary significantly from period to period. 
 We break down our Billings into three sub-categories: New Marketing Billings, Net Renewal Billings, and Other Billings. 
 New Marketing Billings are Billings from all new subscription sales. New Marketing Billings decreased by 41.4 million, or 56.1 , to 32.3 million for third quarter 2024 as compared to 73.7 million for third quarter 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by ceasing new sales campaigns within our Legacy Research Group brands, which began winding down operations in mid-February 2024. 
 New Marketing Billings decreased by 6.3 million, or 16.4 to 32.3 million for third quarter 2024 as compared to 38.7 million in second quarter 2024. The decrease was primarily driven by decreased conversion rates across our product offerings. 
 Net Renewal Billings are Billings from renewals and maintenance fee payments. Net Renewal Billings decreased by 5.0 million, or 24.2 , to 15.7 million for third quarter 2024 as compared to 20.8 million for third quarter 2023. This is primarily a function of a significant decrease (approximately 121 thousand) in average Paid Subscribers for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2024 versus the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net Renewal Billings decreased by 1.4 million, or 8.0 , to 15.7 million for third quarter 2024 as compared to 17.1 million for second quarter 2024. This decrease was a function of declining subscribers overall, with the heaviest decrease coming from our Legacy Research business which began winding down operations in mid-February 2024. 
 Other Billings are Billings from revenue share, advertising and conferences. Other Billings decreased by 0.2 million, or 15.7 to 0.9 million for third quarter 2024 as compared to 1.0 million for third quarter 2023. 
 Other Billings decreased by 0.9 million or 52.0 to 0.9 million for third quarter 2024 as compared to 1.8 million for second quarter 2024 as a result of decreased revenue share activity with third parties. 
 Total Billings decreased by 46.6 million, or 48.8 , to 48.9 million for the third quarter 2024 as compared to 95.5 million for third quarter 2023. While consumer engagement remains soft, we believe the decrease was primarily driven by our Legacy Research Group brands, which began winding down operations in mid-February 2024. 
 Total Billings decreased by 8.6 million, or 15.0 , to 48.9 million for third quarter 2024 as compared to 57.6 million for second quarter 2024. The decrease is distributed across the business as the overall subscriber case continues to decline with some additional impact driven by our Legacy Research Group brands, which began winding down operations in mid-February 2024.

Comparison of Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Net Revenue 
 (In thousands) Three Months Ended September 30, Change Change 2024 2023 Net revenue 97,186 106,150 (8,964) (8.4) 
 The decrease in net revenue was primarily driven by a 7.7 million decrease in term subscription revenue, and a 1.0 million decrease in membership subscription revenue. 
 Term subscription revenue decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to lower Billings as compared to the 2023 period which was driven by reduced engagement of prospective and existing subscribers in the 2024 period. Membership subscription revenue decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily driven by lower Billings.

 Cost of Revenue 
 Cost of revenue decreased primarily driven by a 1.5 million decrease in credit card fees and a 0.4 million decrease in salaries, taxes and benefits. This was partially offset by a 0.7 million increase in freelance editorial expenses, and a 0.2 million increase in incentive compensation. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Sales and marketing expense decreased primarily driven by a 8.5 million decrease in marketing expense, as we have reduced our marketing spend as part of our cost reduction initiatives, a 5.7 million decrease in amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs, and a 2.1 million decrease in salaries, taxes and benefits due to a reduction in workforce. This was partially offset by a 0.2 million increase in outside labor. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expense decreased primarily driven by a 4.9 million decrease in incentive compensation, a 0.9 million decrease in administrative expenses related to outside labor, and a 0.7 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense. This was partially offset by a 3.0 million increase in professional fees, and a 1.7 million increase in severance expense primarily related to the Legacy Reorganization. 
 Impairment of Intangible Assets 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we determined that impairment indicators were present with respect to our Buttonwood Publishing business which we had acquired during 2022, due to continuing losses. As a result, we recorded an impairment loss on Buttonwood Publishing s intangible assets totaling 0.6 million.

 The decrease in net revenue was primarily driven by a 32.7 million decrease in term subscription revenue, partially offset by a 7.4 million increase in membership subscription revenue and a 0.4 million increase in non-subscription revenue. 
 42 

Term subscription revenue decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to lower Billings as compared to the 2023 period. Membership subscription revenue increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily driven by the recognition of deferred revenue from previous periods.

 Cost of Revenue 
 Cost of revenue decreased primarily driven by a 3.0 million decrease in credit card fees, and a 2.8 million decrease in salaries, taxes and benefits. This was partially offset by a 1.2 million increase in incentive compensation. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Sales and marketing expense decreased primarily driven by a 12.4 million decrease in marketing expense as we have reduced our marketing spend as part of our cost reduction initiatives and due to higher per unit subscriber acquisition costs, a 5.6 million decrease in salaries, taxes and benefits, a 5.1 million decrease in amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs, and a 0.4 million decrease in stock based compensation. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expense decreased primarily driven by a 7.2 million decrease in incentive compensation, and a 2.8 million decrease in salaries, taxes and benefits. 
 Impairment of Intangible Assets 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we determined that impairment indicators were present with respect to our Buttonwood Publishing business which we had acquired during 2022, due to continuing losses. As a result, we recorded an impairment loss on Buttonwood Publishing s intangible assets totaling 0.6 million. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe that the below non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance. We use the below non-GAAP financial measures, collectively, to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance. This non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. A reconciliation is provided below for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly 
 43 

comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

 Adjusted CFFO / Adjusted CFFO Margin 
 We believe that Adjusted CFFO and Adjusted CFFO Margin are useful indicators that provide information to management and investors about our ability to generate cash, and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. 
 Adjusted CFFO and Adjusted CFFO Margin have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of other GAAP financial measures, such as cash flow from operations or operating cash flow margin. Some of the limitations of using Adjusted CFFO and Adjusted CFFO Margin are that these metrics may be calculated differently by other companies in our industry. 
 We expect Adjusted CFFO and Adjusted CFFO Margin to fluctuate in future periods as we invest in our business to execute our growth strategy. These activities, along with any non-recurring items as described above, may result in fluctuations in Adjusted CFFO and Adjusted CFFO Margin in future periods.

CFFO and Adjusted CFFO were negative for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily driven by lower Billings during the period, partially due to the Legacy wind down, incentive compensation payouts during the first quarter, and payments related to renegotiated employment agreements. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 A substantial portion of our cash on hand is the result of the nature of our subscription business. We receive cash up front from our sales of annual, multi-year, and membership subscriptions. For tax and GAAP purposes, however, this revenue is deferred and recognized over the term of the subscription, or in the case of membership subscriptions, over four years for tax and five years for GAAP. Tax distributions are made to MarketWise Members to satisfy their tax obligations when revenue is recognized for tax purposes, not when cash is received. The timing difference between when cash is received and when tax distributions are made results in an accumulation of cash on our balance sheet. 
 We refer to this accumulation of cash as our float which we view as a valuable resource that we may invest or use to expand our operations. We expect that as we grow our business, the amount of our float will increase. The Company estimates that the amount of float was approximately 119.9 million and 120.5 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As part of the Company's broader capital allocation strategy, our consolidated cash balance may from time to time decline below our estimate of the long term float requirement. 
 The Company invests a portion of this cash in financial instruments to achieve reasonable returns on a risk-adjusted basis. The investment allocation decisions are based in part on the anticipated liquidity requirements of the Company including working capital, estimated tax related distributions, and broader capital allocation objectives. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company earned interest income of 1.4 million and 4.8 million, respectively, on our cash portfolio. 
 The Company may allocate a portion of our float to investments meeting pre-determined guidelines, including U.S.-listed equity securities, with the objective to provide an acceptable rate of return while complying with established risk tolerances and liquidity parameters. The Board of Directors is responsible for approving investment decisions. Gains and losses on marketable securities may fluctuate significantly from period to period in the future and could have a significant impact on the Company s results of operations. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash of 94.1 million. Cash and cash equivalents are comprised of bank deposits, money market funds, and certificates of deposit. We have financed our operations primarily through cash received from operations, and our sources of liquidity have enabled us to make continued investments in supporting the growth of our business. We expect that our anticipated operating cash flows, in addition to cash on hand, will enable us to continue to make investments in the future, and to pay dividends. We expect our operating cash flows to further improve as we increase our operational efficiency and experience economies of scale. 
 In 2023, we commenced paying quarterly dividends on shares of our Class A common stock and distributions on our LLC Units. There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends in the future. The payment of any future dividends and distributions will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our results of operations, capital requirements, financial condition, prospects, contractual arrangements, any limitations on payment of dividends present in any debt agreements, and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. 
 We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to support working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our subscription growth rate, subscription renewal activity, including the timing and the amount of cash received from subscribers, the pace of expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the introduction of new and enhanced products, and the level of costs to operate as a public company. We may, in the future, enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, products, and technologies. 
 45 

We expect to incur payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement in the future, which we expect to be significant. MarketWise, Inc. intends to cause MarketWise, LLC to make distributions to MarketWise, Inc. in an amount sufficient to allow MarketWise, Inc. to pay its tax obligations and operating expenses, including distributions to fund any payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement. If MarketWise, LLC does not have sufficient cash to fund distributions to MarketWise, Inc. in amounts sufficient to cover MarketWise, Inc. s obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement, it may have to borrow funds, which could materially adversely affect its liquidity and financial condition and subject it to various restrictions imposed by any such lenders. To the extent that MarketWise, Inc. is unable to make timely payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, the unpaid amounts will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid. For additional information regarding the Tax Receivable Agreement, see the section entitled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Tax Receivable Agreement in the Annual Report. 
 Furthermore, to the extent we have taxable income, we will make distributions to the MarketWise Members and to MarketWise, Inc. in amounts sufficient for the recipients to pay taxes due on their share of MarketWise income at prevailing individual income tax rates, which for the 2024 tax year the highest federal, state and local tax rate the Company used was 49.75 . During third quarter 2024, we made our first required tax distribution of 5.8 million in accordance with the MarketWise Operating Agreement. The distribution was made proportionally to all MarketWise Members and to MarketWise, Inc. Such distributions are reflected in our statement of cash flows as cash used in financing activities, and do not decrease the amount of cash from operations or net income reflected in our financial statements. However, such distributions decrease the amount of cash available for use in our business. 
 We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that we require additional financing, we may not be able to raise such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in continued innovation, we may not be able to compete successfully, which would harm our business, operations, and financial condition. 
 Legacy Reorganization 
 On February 8, 2024, the Company reported that its Board of Directors had committed to a strategic realignment and Reorganization whereby the Company will wind-down the operations of its Legacy Research business in response to misconduct discovered at Legacy Research where certain managers violated the Company s policies. 
 Following the commitment to the Reorganization, Legacy Research continued to serve existing subscribers and fulfill existing subscriptions during the first quarter 2024, but began to significantly curtail business activities including any marketing efforts to acquire new subscribers. 
 As a result of the Reorganization, the Billings of Legacy Research declined from 30.1 million during the fourth quarter 2023 to 15.8 million, 4.9 million and 1.9 million during the first, second and third quarters of 2024, respectively. During second quarter 2024, we began the process of offering certain Legacy Research subscribers similar products published by other MarketWise brands, consistent with past Company practice when we cease a publication. We continued this process during third quarter 2024. 
 In October 2024, we completed our Reorganization and operational transition plans with respect to substantially all of the Legacy Research brands, which resulted in the transfer of the related assets and related fulfillment obligations to other businesses within MarketWise for fair consideration. We also entered into agreements in October 2024 to sell certain Legacy Research brands that had immaterial year-to-date September 2024 Billings, one of which was to a related party. 
 Separation costs incurred in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled approximately 1.3 million and 2.3 million, respectively. The annualized compensation cost savings associated with the terminated employees is approximately 16.1 million. 
 Legacy Research has leased office space and the current lease end date for this property is December 2028. As of September 30, 2024, the operating lease right-of-use asset and related leasehold improvements totaled 
 46 

approximately 2.7 million. The Company has ceased using this property in its operations and is evaluating various alternatives with respect to this property as of September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Legacy Research reporting unit had goodwill totaling 8.6 million and a negative carrying value, which we considered in our related goodwill impairment assessment as of that date. 
 Credit Facility 
 In 2021, MarketWise, LLC, entered into a loan and security agreement (the Loan and Security Agreement providing for up to 150 million of commitments under a revolving credit facility (the 2021 Credit Facility ), including a 5 million letter of credit sublimit, and allows for revolving commitments under the 2021 Credit Facility to be increased or new term commitments to be established by up to 65 million. The existing lenders under the 2021 Credit Facility are entitled, but not obligated, to provide such incremental commitments. On May 2, 2023, MarketWise, LLC entered into the First Amendment to the Loan and Security Agreement, which provides, among other things, a transition away from LIBOR to SOFR as the basis for the interest rate. The 2021 Credit Facility had a term of three years, and matured on October 29, 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, credit facility fees were approximately 0.3 million. While the Company currently has no immediate needs for external capital, and the business plan is fully funded, we may in the future consider entering into a new credit facility to enhance optionality around capital allocation alternatives. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table presents a summary of our consolidated cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities for the periods indicated: 
 (In thousands) Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities (28,135) 44,901 Net cash used in investing activities (788) (1,658) Net cash used in financing activities (32,131) (7,806) 
 Operating Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 28.1 million, primarily due to net income of 66.7 million, adjusted for net non-cash addbacks of items of 14.5 million, and net changes in our operating assets and liabilities which reduced cash by 109.3 million, largely due to timing differences in the net receipt of cash. The non-cash items include stock-based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization of 8.7 million and 2.0 million, respectively. The changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily driven by a decrease in deferred revenue, which reduced cash by 133.6 million due to lower Billings, and a decrease in accrued expenses, which decreased cash by 32.7 million, partially offset by a decrease in deferred contract acquisition costs, which increased cash by 50.4 million. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was 44.9 million, primarily due to net income of 52.4 million, adjusted for net non-cash items which increased cash by 19.8 million, and net changes in our operating assets and liabilities which reduced cash by 27.3 million, largely due to timing differences in the net receipt of cash. The non-cash items include stock-based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization of 10.3 million and 3.0 million, respectively. The changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily driven by a decrease in deferred revenue, which reduced cash by 44.3 million due to our overall decrease in sales, a decrease in other current and long-term liabilities which reduced cash by 3.2 million, and a decrease in accrued expenses, which decreased cash by 3.3 million, partially offset by a decrease in deferred contract acquisition costs, which increased cash by 23.6 million. 
 Investing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 0.8 million, primarily driven by 0.7 million of capitalized software development costs. 
 47 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in investing activities was 1.7 million, primarily driven by 1.4 million of capitalized software development costs. 
 Financing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was 32.1 million, primarily due to 19.1 million in distributions to noncontrolling interests, 10.8 million in repurchases of stock, and 1.4 million in restricted stock units withheld to pay taxes. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in financing activities was 7.8 million, primarily due to 6.3 million in distributions to noncontrolling interests and 1.5 million in restricted stock units withheld to pay taxes. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs, and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 Management believes that, of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 in our Annual Report, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, management believes that Revenue Recognition and Transactions and Valuation of Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets are the two policies that are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our condensed consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Refer to the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of these two policies. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to these policies. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Not applicable. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the financial statements for the periods covered by and included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly state, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with U.S. GAAP. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act. 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 48 

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Furthermore, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. 
 These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
