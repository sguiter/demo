Overview 

Greenland Technologies Holding Corporation (the
 Company or Greenland designs, develops, manufactures and sells components and products for the global material
handling industries. 

Through its PRC subsidiaries, Greenland offers
transmission products, which are key components for forklift trucks used in manufacturing and logistic applications, such as factories,
workshops, warehouses, fulfilment centers, shipyards, and seaports. Forklifts play an important role in the logistic systems of many companies
across different industries in China and globally. Generally, industries with the largest demand for forklifts include the transportation,
warehousing logistics, electrical machinery, and automobile industries. Greenland s revenue decreased from approximately 67.56
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 64.57 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in revenue
was primarily the result of the decrease of approximately 2.88 million in the Company s sales volume of transmission products for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Nevertheless, based on the revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Greenland
believes that it is one of the major developers and manufacturers of transmission products for small and medium-sized forklift trucks
in China. 

Greenland s transmission products are used
in 1-ton to 15-tons forklift trucks, some with mechanical shift and some with automatic shift. Greenland sells these transmission products
directly to forklift-truck manufacturers. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Greenland sold an aggregate of 114,075
and 112,414 sets of transmission products, respectively, to more than 100 forklift manufacturers in the PRC. 

In January 2020, Greenland launched HEVI Corp. HEVI ), formerly known as Greenland Technologies Corp. to focus on the production and sale of electric industrial vehicles
to meet the increasing demand for electric industrial vehicles and machinery powered by sustainable energy in order to reduce air pollution
and lower carbon emissions. HEVI is a wholly owned subsidiary of Greenland incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. HEVI s
electric industrial vehicle products currently include GEF-series electric forklifts, a series of lithium powered forklifts with three
models ranging in size from 1.8 tons to 3.5 tons, GEL-1800, a 1.8 ton rated load lithium powered electric wheeled front loader, GEX-8000,
an all-electric 8.0 ton rated load lithium powered wheeled excavator, and GEL-5000, an all-electric 5.0 ton rated load lithium wheeled
front loader. In addition, HEVI introduced a line of mobile DC battery chargers that support DC powered EV applications in the North America
market. These products are available for purchase in the United States U.S. market. In August 2022, Greenland launched
a 54,000 square foot industrial electric vehicle assembly site in Baltimore, Maryland to support local services, assembly and distribution
of its electric industrial heavy equipment products line. In July 2024, HEVI announced a partnership with Lonking Holdings Limited to
develop and distribute heavy electric machinery and related technology specialized for the U.S. market. In August 2024, HEVI launched
its H55L all-electric wheeled front-end loader, which can lift up to six tons in indoor and outdoor applications without the mess and
emissions of diesel, and the H65L all-electric wheeled front-end loader, the largest lithium battery powered electric wheel loader commercially
available in North America.

Greenland serves as the parent company of Greenland
Holding Enterprises Inc. Greenland Holding ), a company incorporated in the State of Delaware and a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Greenland, which in turns holds 100 of the equity interests in Zhongchai Holding (Hong Kong) Limited, a holding company formed under
the laws of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Hong Kong on April 23, 2009 Zhongchai Holding ).
Zhongchai Holding s subsidiaries include Zhejiang Zhongchai Machinery Co. Ltd., an operating company formed under the laws of the
People s Republic of China (the PRC or China in 2005, Hangzhou Greenland Energy Technologies Co., Ltd. Hangzhou Greenland ), an operating company formed under the laws of the PRC in 2019, and Hengyu Capital Limited, a company
formed in Hong Kong on August 16, 2022 Hengyu Capital ). Through Zhongchai Holding and its subsidiaries, Greenland develops
and manufactures traditional transmission products for material handling machineries in the PRC.

that of approximately 21.84 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in revenue was primarily a result of
the decrease of approximately 2.88 million in the Company s sales volume of transmission products for the three months ended September

The write down of inventory using the net realizable value impairment test is also recorded in cost of goods sold. The total cost of goods
sold was approximately 13.87 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease by approximately 1.70 million,
or 10.9 , as compared to that of approximately 15.57 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of goods sold decreased
due to the decrease in our sales volume.

 0.61 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was mainly due to a decrease in advertising and marketing expenses
and shipping expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

to that of approximately 1.61 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in general and administrative expenses
was mainly due to the decrease of approximately 0.23 million in provision for inventory and the decrease of approximately 0.18 million

64.8 , as compared to that of approximately 1.25 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Such decrease was primarily attributable
to a significant decrease in the Company s R D activities during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Income from Operations 

Income from operations for the three months ended
September 30, 2024 was approximately 2.93 million, representing an increase of approximately 0.12 million, as compared to that of approximately
 2.81 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Interest Income and Interest Expenses 

Greenland s interest income was approximately
 0.24 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, representing an increase of approximately 0.24 million, or
5,494.8 , as compared to that of approximately 0.00 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in
interest income was because more cash was deposited in banks during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three
months ended September 30, 2023. 

Greenland s interest expenses were approximately
 0.01 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of approximately 0.06 million, or 87.0 , as compared
to that of approximately 0.07 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of
our short-term loans for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to those for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Other Income 

Greenland s other income was approximately
 0.21 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, representing an increase of approximately 1.87 million, or 112.5 , as compared
to approximately 1.66 million in other loss for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a decrease
in investment loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to those for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Income Taxes 

Greenland s income tax was approximately
 0.34 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to that of approximately 0.88 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2023.

Zhejiang Zhongchai obtained a high-tech
enterprise status near the end of the fiscal year of 2022. Such status allows Zhejiang Zhongchai to enjoy a reduced statutory income
tax rate of 15 , rather than the standard PRC corporate income tax rate of 25 . Income tax for the nine months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023 were calculated based on a rate of 15 . The high-tech enterprise status is reevaluated by relevant Chinese government
agencies every three years. Zhejiang Zhongchai s current high-tech enterprise will be reevaluated near the end of
2025. 

Greenland s other PRC subsidiaries are subject
to different income tax rates. Hangzhou Greenland, the wholly owned subsidiary of Zhongchai Holding, is subject to the 25 standard income
tax rate Greenland is a holding company registered in the British Virgin Islands and is not subject to tax on income or capital gains
under the current British Virgin Islands law. In addition, upon payment of dividends to its shareholders, the Company will not be subject
to any British Virgin Islands withholding tax. 

On January 14, 2020, Greenland established HEVI,
its wholly owned subsidiary in the state of Delaware. HEVI promotes sales of sustainable alternative products for the heavy industrial
equipment industry, including electric industrial vehicles, in the North American market. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. federal government
enacted the 2017 Tax Act. The 2017 Tax Act includes a number of changes in existing tax law impacting businesses, including the transition
tax, a one-time deemed repatriation of cumulative undistributed foreign earnings and a permanent reduction in the U.S. federal statutory
rate from 35 to 21 , effective on January 1, 2018. ASC 740 requires companies to recognize the effect of tax law changes in the period
of enactment, and accordingly, the effects must be recognized on companies calendar year-end financial statements, even though
the effective date for most provisions is January 1, 2018. Since HEVI was established in 2020, the one-time transition tax did not have
any impact on the Company s tax provision and there was no undistributed accumulated earnings and profits as of September 30, 2024. 

On March 26, 2024, the Company entered into a
share exchange agreement with Greenland Holding Enterprises Inc. and Zhongchai Holding (the 2024 Share Exchange Agreement ).
Pursuant to the 2024 Share Exchange Agreement, Greenland Holding Enterprises Inc. issued 100 shares of common stock to the Company, par
value 0.01 per share, representing all issued and outstanding share capital of Greenland Holding Enterprises Inc., in exchange for 100 
of the equity interest of Zhongchai Holding. Greenland Holding Enterprises Inc. is a holding company registered on August 28, 2023 in
the State of Delaware with no material operations. Since Greenland Holding Enterprises Inc. was established in 2023, the one-time transition
tax did not have any impact on the Company s tax provision and there was no undistributed accumulated earnings and profits as of
September 30, 2024. 

Net Income 

Our net income was approximately 0.36 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2024, representing an increase of approximately 0.17 million, as compared to that of approximately
 0.19 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Revenue 

Greenland s revenue was approximately 64.57
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of approximately 2.99 million, or 4.4 , as compared to
that of approximately 67.56 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in revenue was primarily a result of the
decrease of approximately 3.60 million in the Company s sales volume of transmission products for the nine months ended September
30, 2024. On an RMB basis, our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by approximately 2.2 as compared to that
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Cost of Goods Sold 

Greenland s cost of goods sold consists
primarily of material costs, freight charges, purchasing and receiving costs, inspection costs, internal transfer costs, wages, employee
compensation, amortization, depreciation and related costs, which are directly attributable to the Company s manufacturing activities.
The write down of inventory using the net realizable value impairment test is also recorded in cost of goods sold. The total cost of goods
sold was approximately 47.19 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease by approximately 1.65 million,
or 3.4 , as compared to that of approximately 48.84 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of goods sold decreased
due to the decrease in our sales volume. 

Gross Profit 

Greenland s gross profit was approximately
 17.39 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease by approximately 1.33 million, or 7.1 , as compared
to that of approximately 18.72 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and
2023, Greenland s gross margins were approximately 26.9 and 27.7 , respectively. The decrease in gross profit in the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to a decrease in our sales volume. 

7 

Operating Expenses 

Greenland s operating expenses consist of
selling expenses, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses. 

Selling Expenses 

Selling expenses mainly comprise of operating
expenses such as sales staff payroll, traveling expenses, and transportation expenses. Our selling expenses were approximately 1.41 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of approximately 0.16 million, or 10.0 , as compared to approximately
 1.57 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was mainly due to a decrease in advertising and marketing expenses
and shipping expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

General and Administrative Expenses 

General and administrative expenses comprise of
management and staff salaries, employee benefits, depreciation for office facility and office furniture and equipment, travel and entertainment
expenses, legal and accounting fees, financial consulting fees, and other office expenses. General and administrative expenses were approximately
 4.59 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of approximately 0.18 million, or 3.9 , as compared
to that of approximately 4.77 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in general and administrative expenses
was mainly due to a decrease in professional fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September
30, 2023. 

Research and Development (R D) Expenses 

R D expenses consist of R D personnel
compensation, costs of materials used in R D projects, and depreciation costs for research-related equipment. R D expenses were
approximately 2.55 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of approximately 1.24 million, or 32.8 ,
as compared to that of approximately 3.79 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Such decrease was primarily attributable
to a significant decrease in the Company s R D activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Income from Operations 

Income from operations for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 was approximately 8.84 million, representing an increase of approximately 0.25 million, as compared to that of approximately
 8.59 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Interest Income and Interest Expenses 

Greenland s interest income was approximately
 0.62 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing an increase of approximately 0.54 million, or
684.5 , as compared to that of approximately 0.08 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest
income was because more cash was deposited in banks during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. 

Greenland s interest expenses were approximately
 0.09 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of approximately 0.13 million, or 59.2 , as compared
to that of approximately 0.22 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of our
short-term loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to those for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Other Income 

Greenland s other income was approximately
 1.02 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing an increase of approximately 2.39 million, or 174.4 , as compared
to approximately 1.37 million in other loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a decrease
in investment loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to that for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

8 

Income Taxes 

Greenland s income tax was approximately
 0.84 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to that of approximately 1.48 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. 

Net Income 

Our net income was approximately 9.80 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing an increase of approximately 4.21 million, as compared to that of approximately
 5.59 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Greenland is a holding company incorporated in
the British Virgin Islands. Current PRC regulations permit our PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends to us only out of their accumulated profits,
if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, our PRC subsidiaries are required to set
aside at least 10 of their respective accumulated profits each year, if any, to fund certain reserve funds until the total amount set
aside reaches 50 of their respective registered capital. Our PRC subsidiaries may also allocate a portion of their after-tax profits
based on PRC accounting standards to employee welfare and bonus funds at their discretion. These reserves are not distributable as cash
dividends. 

We have funded working capital and other capital
requirements primarily by equity contributions, cash flow from operations, short-term bank loans and bank acceptance notes, and long-term
bank loans. Cash is required primarily to purchase raw materials, repay debts and pay salaries, office expenses, income taxes and other
operating expenses. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
our PRC subsidiary, Zhejiang Zhongchai, paid off approximately 8.56 million in bank loan, approximately 0.69 million in loan to third
parties, and maintained 17.63 million cash on hand. We plan to maintain the current debt structure and rely on governmentally supported
loans with lower costs, if necessary. 

Government subsidies mainly consist of an incentive
granted by the Chinese government to encourage transformation of fixed assets in China and other miscellaneous subsidies from the Chinese
government. Government subsidies are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the subsidy will be received and all conditions
be completed. Total government subsidies recorded under long-term liabilities were 1.37 million and 1.53 million as of September 30,
2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

The Company currently plans to fund its operations
mainly through cash flow from its operations, renewal of bank borrowings, additional equity financing, and continuation of financial support
from its shareholders and affiliates controlled by its principal shareholders, if necessary. The Company might implement a stricter policy
on sales to less creditworthy customers and plans to continue to improve its collection efforts on accounts with outstanding balances.
The Company is actively working with customers and suppliers and expects to fully collect the remaining balance. 

We believe that the Company has sufficient cash,
even with uncertainty in the Company s manufacturing and sale of electric industrial heavy equipment in the future and decline on
sale of transmission products. However, our capital contribution from existing funding sources, to operate for the next 12 months will
be sufficient. We remain confident and expect to continue to generate positive cash flow from our operations. 

9 

We may need additional cash resources in the future,
if the Company experiences failure in collecting account receivables, changes in business condition, changes in financial condition, or
other developments. We may also need additional cash resources, if the Company wishes to pursue opportunities for investment, acquisition,
strategic cooperation, or other similar actions. If the Company s management and its board of directors determine that the cash
required for specific corporate activities exceed Greenland s cash and cash equivalents on hand, the Company may issue debt or equity
securities to raise cash. 

Historically, we have expended considerable resources
on building a new factory and paid off a considerable amount of debt, resulting in less available cash. However, we anticipate that our
cash flow will continue to improve for the remainder of fiscal year 2024. More specifically, Zhejiang Zhongchai has completed the construction
of a new factory, and our PRC subsidiaries have received COVID-19 related government subsidies. Furthermore, Zhejiang Zhongchai pledged
the deed of its new factory as a collateral to banks in order to obtain additional loans, refinance expiring loans, restructure short-term
loans, and fund other working capital needs upon acceptable terms to Greenland. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Cash equivalents refers to all highly liquid investments
purchased with original maturity of three months or less. As of September 30, 2024, Greenland had approximately 17.63 million of cash
and cash equivalents, representing a decrease of approximately 5.35 million, or 23.27 , as compared to approximately 22.98 million as
of December 31, 2023. The decrease of cash and cash equivalents was mainly due to a decrease in short-term bank loans and notes payable,
as compared to that as of December 31, 2023. 

Restricted Cash 

Restricted cash represents the amount held by
a bank as security for bank acceptance notes and therefore is not available for use until the bank acceptance notes are fulfilled or expired,
which typically takes less than twelve months. As of September 30, 2024, Greenland had approximately 3.09 million of restricted cash,
representing a decrease of approximately 2.12 million, or 40.64 , as compared to that of approximately 5.21 million as of December 31,
2023. The decrease of restricted cash was due to a decrease of notes payable. 

Accounts Receivable 

As of September 30, 2024, Greenland had approximately
 20.27 million of accounts receivables, an increase of approximately 3.79 million, or 22.97 , as compared to approximately 16.48 million
as of December 31, 2023. The increase in accounts receivables was due to the increase in our sales volume and our slowed-down efforts
in receivables collections. 

Greenland recorded approximately 1.46 million
and 0.87 million of allowance for expected credit losses as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Greenland conducted
an aging analysis of each customer s delinquent payments to determine whether allowance for expected credit losses is adequate.
In establishing the allowance for expected credit losses, Greenland considers historical experience, economic environment, and expected
collectability of past due receivables. An estimate of expected credit losses is recorded when collection of the full amount is no longer
probable. When bad debts are identified, such debts are written off against the allowance for expected credit losses. Greenland will continuously
assess its expected credit losses based on the credit history of and relationships with its customers on a regular basis to determine
whether its allowance for expected credit losses on its accounts receivables is adequate. Greenland believes that its collection policies
are generally in line with the transmissions industry s standard in the PRC. 

Due from Related Party 

Due from related party was 0.23 million and 0.23
million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Other receivable from Zhuhai Hengzhong Industrial Investment Fund
(Limited Partnership) was 0.23 million and 0.23 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, representing a
loan with an annual interest rate of 4.785 . 

10 

Notes Receivable 

As of September 30, 2024, Greenland had approximately
 27.68 million of notes receivables, which Greenland expects to collect within the next twelve months. The increase was approximately
 0.56 million, or 2.01 , as compared to approximately 27.14 million as of December 31, 2023. 

Working Capital 

Our working capital was approximately 40.49 million
as of September 30, 2024, as compared to 27.27 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase in working capital of 13.22 million was
primarily contributed to a decrease in fixed deposit and notes payable.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
the main sources of cash inflow from operating activities were net income, inventories, and other current and noncurrent assets, with
each amounted to approximately 9.80 million, 3.07 million and 1.65 million, respectively. The main causes of cash outflow were changes
in accounts receivable and other current and noncurrent assets, with each amounted to approximately 4.10 million and 1.80 million, respectively.

Net cash used in investing activities resulted
in cash outflow of approximately 2.11 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Cash used in investing activities for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 was mainly due to approximately 1.42 million used for purchases of long-term assets and approximately
 0.69 million in loans to third parties. 

Net cash provided by investing activities resulted
in cash inflow of approximately 1.22 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash provided by investing activities for

11 

Financing Activities 

Net cash used in financing activities resulted
a cash outflow of approximately 14.39 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was mainly attributable to approximately
 8.56 million in repayment of short-term bank loans and approximately 11.39 million in repayment of notes payable. Such amounts were
further offset by approximately 5.56 million in proceeds from short-term bank loans. 

Net cash used in financing activities resulted

 6.77 million in proceeds from short-term bank loans and approximately 4.13 million in notes payable. Such amounts were further offset
by approximately 8.81 million in repayment of short-term bank loans and approximately 0.43 million in repayment of loans to third parties. 

Credit Risk 

Credit risk is one of the most significant risks
for Greenland s business. Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and derived from revenues earned from customers, thereby exposing
Greenland to credit risk. Credit risk is controlled by the application of credit approvals, limits, and monitoring procedures. Greenland
identifies credit risk collectively based on industry, geography, and customer type. This information is monitored regularly by the Company s
management. In measuring the credit risk of sales to customers, Greenland mainly reflects the probability of default by
the customer on its contractual obligations and considers the current financial position of the customer and the exposures to the customer
and its future development. 

Liquidity Risk 

Greenland is exposed to liquidity risk when it
is unable to provide sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet its commitments and/or business needs. Liquidity risk is managed
by the application of financial position analysis to test if Greenland is in danger of liquidity issues and also by application of monitoring
procedures to constantly monitor its conditions and movements. When necessary, Greenland resorts to other financial institutions to obtain
additional short-term funding to meet the liquidity shortage. 

Inflation Risk 

Greenland is also exposed to inflation risk. Inflationary
factors, such as increases in raw material and overhead costs, could impair Greenland s operating results. Although Greenland does
not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation
in the future may have an adverse effect on its ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and operating expenses as a percentage
of sales revenues if the selling prices of its products do not increase with such increased costs. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

We prepare our consolidated financial statements
in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In applying accounting principles, it is often required to use estimates. These estimates consider the facts,
circumstances and information available, and may be based on subjective inputs, assumptions and information known and unknown to us. Material
changes in certain of the estimates that we use could potentially affect, by a material amount, our consolidated financial position and
results of operations. Although results may vary, we believe our estimates are reasonable and appropriate. See Note 2 to our consolidated
financial statements included in Item 1 - Financial Statements (Unaudited) for a summary of our significant accounting policies.
The following describes certain of our significant accounting policies that involve more subjective and complex judgments where the effect
on our consolidated financial position and operating performance could be material. 

12 

Revenue Recognition 

In accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue
from Contracts with Customers, the Company recognizes revenues when goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount
that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In determining when and
how revenues are recognized from contracts with customers, the Company performs the following five-step analysis: (i) identification of
contract with customer (ii) determination of performance obligations (iii) measurement of the transaction price (iv)
allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations, and (v) recognition of revenues when (or as) the Company satisfies
each performance obligation. The Company derives revenues from the processing, distribution and sale of its products. The Company recognizes
its revenues net of value added taxes VAT ). The Company is subject to VAT which had been levied at the rate of 17 on the
invoiced value of sales until April 30, 2018, after which date the rate was reduced to 16 . VAT rate was further reduced to 13 starting
from April 1, 2019. Output VAT is borne by customers in addition to the invoiced value of sales and input VAT is borne by the Company
in addition to the invoiced value of purchases to the extent not refunded for export sales. 

Revenues are recognized at a point in time once
the Company has determined that the customer has obtained control over the product. Control is typically deemed to have been transferred
to the customer when the performance obligation is fulfilled, usually at the time of customers acceptance or consumption, at the
net sales price (transaction price) and each of the criteria under ASC 606 have been met. Contract terms may require the Company to deliver
the finished goods to the customers location or the customer may pick up the finished goods at the Company s factory. International
sales are recognized when shipment clears customs and leaves the port. 

The Company adopted ASC 606 on January 1, 2018,
using the transition method of Modified-Retrospective Method MRM ). The adoption of ASC 606 had no impact on the Company s
beginning balance of retained earnings. 

The Company s contracts are all short-term
in nature with a contract term of one year or less. Receivables are recorded when the Company has an unconditional right to consideration. 

Business Combination 

On October 24, 2019, we consummated our Business
Combination with Zhongchai Holding following a special meeting of the shareholders, where the shareholders of Greenland considered and
approved, among other matters, a proposal to adopt and entered into the Share Exchange Agreement, dated as of July 12, 2019, among (i)
Greenland, (ii) Zhongchai Holding, (iii) the Sponsor in the capacity as the Purchaser Representative, and (iv) Cenntro Holding Limited,
the sole member of Zhongchai Holding. 

Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, Greenland
acquired from Cenntro Holding Limited all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Zhongchai Holding in exchange for 7,500,000
newly issued ordinary shares, no par value of Greenland, to Cenntro Holding Limited. As a result, Cenntro Holding Limited became the then
controlling shareholder of Greenland, and Zhongchai Holding became a directly and wholly owned subsidiary of Greenland. The Business Combination
was accounted for as a reverse merger effected by a share exchange, wherein Zhongchai Holding is considered the acquirer for accounting
and financial reporting purposes. 

Pursuant to that certain finder agreement with
Hanyi Zhou dated May 29, 2019 (the Finder Agreement ), 50,000 newly issued ordinary shares issued to Hanyi Zhou as a finder
fee for the Business Combination. 

Inventories 

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or
net realizable value, which is based on estimated selling prices less any further costs expected to be incurred for completion and disposal.
Cost of raw materials is calculated using the weighted average method and is based on purchase cost. Work-in-progress and finished goods
costs are determined using the weighted average method and comprise direct materials, direct labor and an appropriate proportion of overhead. 

13 

Income Taxes 

The Company accounts for income taxes following
the liability method pursuant to FASB ASC 740 Income Taxes . Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined
based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in
effect in the period in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to offset deferred tax
assets if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets
will not be realized. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment
date. 

The Company also follows FASB ASC 740, which addresses
the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements.
The Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will
be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the
financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood
of being realized upon ultimate settlement. ASC 740 also provides guidance on recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income
taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not have any liability
for unrecognized tax benefits. It is the Company s policy to include penalties and interest expense related to income taxes as a
component of other expense and interest expense, respectively, as necessary. The Company s historical tax years will remain open
for examination by the local authorities until the statute of limitations has passed.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

The Company is not required to provide the information
required by this item as it is a smaller reporting company. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Disclosure controls, as defined under Rule 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act, are procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required
to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this report, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within
the time specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such
information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

14 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As of September 30, 2024, we carried out an evaluation,
under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer,
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based upon such evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer
concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective. Such conclusion
is based on the presence of the following material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024: 

Accounting and Financial Reporting Personnel
Material Weakness - As noted in Item 9A of our annual report on Form 10-K for the preceding fiscal year, management concluded
that in light of a lack of sufficient and competent financial reporting and accounting personnel with appropriate knowledge of U.S. GAAP
and SEC reporting requirements to prepare consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with U.S. GAAP and SEC
reporting requirements, we did not maintain effective controls and did not implement adequate and proper supervisory review to ensure
that significant internal control deficiencies can be detected or prevented. 

As a result, the Company has developed a remedial
plan to strengthen its accounting and financial reporting functions. To strengthen the Company s internal control over financial
reporting, the Company is currently implementing the following remedial actions: 

developing and formalizing of key accounting and financial reporting policies and procedures; 

recruiting more financial reporting and accounting personnel who have adequate U.S. GAAP knowledge; 

training key position staff by U.S. accountant with U.S. corporate accounting experiences, and gaining additional knowledge and professional skills about SEC regulations and U.S. GAAP; 

planning to acquire additional resources to strengthen the financial reporting function and set up a financial and system control framework; and 

establishing effective oversight and clarifying reporting requirements for non-recurring and complex transactions to ensure consolidated financial statements and related disclosures are accurate, complete and in compliance with U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting requirements. 

Inherent limitation on the effectiveness of
internal control 

The effectiveness of any system of internal control
over financial reporting, including ours, is subject to inherent limitations, including the exercise of judgment in designing, implementing,
operating, and evaluating the controls and procedures, and the inability to eliminate misconduct completely. Accordingly, any system of
internal control over financial reporting, including ours, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable, not
absolute assurances. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
We intend to continue to monitor and upgrade our internal controls as necessary or appropriate for our business but cannot assure you
that such improvements will be sufficient to provide us with effective internal control over financial reporting. 

Notwithstanding the material weakness in our internal
control over financial reporting, the consolidated unaudited financial statements included in this Quarter Report on Form 10-Q fairly
present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

During the most recently completed fiscal quarter,
there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Risks Related to our Business and Industry 

Our subsidiaries business operations
are cash intensive, and our subsidiaries business could be adversely affected if we fail to maintain sufficient levels of liquidity
and working capital. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately
 17.63 million of cash and cash equivalents. Historically, we have spent a significant amount of cash on our operational activities, principally
to procure raw materials for our subsidiaries products. Our short-term loans are from Chinese banks and are generally secured by
a portion of our fixed assets, land use rights and/or guarantees by related parties. Certain of these loans are secured against a portion
of the shares of our PRC subsidiaries. The term of a majority of such loans is one year. Historically, we rolled over such loans on an
annual basis. However, we may not have sufficient funds available to pay all of our borrowings upon maturity in the future. Failure to
roll over our short-term borrowings at maturity or to service our debt could result in a transfer of the ownership of a portion of the
shares of our PRC subsidiaries to secured lenders, the imposition of penalties, including increases in interest rates, legal actions against
us by our creditors, and even insolvency. 

Although we have been able to maintain adequate
working capital primarily through cash from operations and short-term and long-term borrowings, any failure by our customers to settle
outstanding accounts receivable, or our inability to borrow sufficient capital from local banks in the future could materially and adversely
affect our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations. 

We grant relatively long payment terms for
accounts receivable which can adversely affect our cash flow. 

As is customary in China, for competitive reasons,
we grant relatively long payment terms to most of our subsidiaries customers. The allowances we establish for our receivables may
not be adequate. We are subject to the risk that we may be unable to collect accounts receivable in a timely manner. If the accounts receivable
cannot be collected in time, or at all, a significant amount of expected credit losses will occur, and our business, financial condition
and results of operation will likely be materially and adversely affected. 

Our subsidiaries face short lead-times for
delivery of products to customers. Failure to meet delivery deadlines could result in the loss of customers and damage to our reputation
and goodwill. 

Most of our subsidiaries customers are
large manufacturers, who generally place large orders for our subsidiaries products and require prompt delivery. Our subsidiaries 
product sale agreements typically contain short lead-times for the delivery of products and tight production and manufacturer supply
schedules that can reduce our profit margins on the products procured from our subsidiaries suppliers. Our subsidiaries 
suppliers may lack sufficient capacity at any given time to meet all of the demands from our subsidiaries customers if orders exceed
their production capacity. Our subsidiaries strive for rapid response to customer demands, which can lead to reduced purchasing efficiency,
increased procurement costs and low profit margins. If our subsidiaries are unable to meet the customer demands, they may lose customers.
Moreover, failure to meet customer demands may damage our reputation and goodwill. 

Our subsidiaries face intense competition,
and, if our subsidiaries are unable to compete effectively, we may not be able to maintain profitability. 

Our subsidiaries compete with many other companies
located in the PRC and internationally that manufacture similar products. Many of our subsidiaries competitors are larger companies
with greater financial resources. Intense competition in a challenging economic environment in the PRC has, in the past, put pressure
on our margins and may adversely affect our future financial performance. Moreover, intense competition may result in potential or actual
litigation between our subsidiaries and their competitors relating to such activities as competitive sales practices, relationships with
key suppliers and customers or other matters. 

It is likely that our subsidiaries competitors
will seek to develop similar competing products in the near future. Some of our subsidiaries competitors may have more resources
than our subsidiaries do, operate in greater scale, be more capitalized than our subsidiaries are, have access to cheaper raw materials
than our subsidiaries do, or offer products at a more competitive price. There can be no assurance that our initial competitive advantage
will be retained and that one or more competitors will not develop products that are equal or superior in quality and are better priced
than our subsidiaries products. If our subsidiaries are unable to compete effectively, our results of operations and financial
position may be materially and adversely affected. 

19 

Our revenues are highly dependent on a limited
number of customers and the loss of any one of our subsidiaries major customers could materially and adversely affect our growth
and revenues. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, our subsidiaries five largest customers contributed 41.01 and 47.73 of our revenues, respectively. For the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Greenland s single largest customer, Hangcha Group, accounted for 13.81 and 16.14 , respectively,
of Greenland s total revenue, and Greenland s second largest customer, Longgong Forklift Truck, accounted for 12.55 and 11.39 ,
respectively, of Greenland s total revenue. As a result of our subsidiaries reliance on a limited number of customers, our
subsidiaries may face pricing and other competitive pressures, which may have a material adverse effect on our profits and our revenues.
The volume of products sold for specific customers varies from year to year, especially since our subsidiaries are not the exclusive provider
for any customers. In addition, there are a number of factors that could cause the loss of a customer or a substantial reduction in the
products that our subsidiaries provide to any customer that may not be predictable. For example, our subsidiaries customers may
decide to reduce spending on our subsidiaries products or a customer may no longer need our subsidiaries products following
the completion of a project. The loss of any one of our subsidiaries major customers, a decrease in the volume of sales to our
subsidiaries customers or a decrease in the price at which our subsidiaries sell their products to customers could materially adversely
affected our profits and revenues. 

In addition, this customer concentration may subject
our subsidiaries to perceived or actual leverage that our subsidiaries customers may have in negotiations, given their relative
size and importance to our subsidiaries. If our subsidiaries customers seek to negotiate their agreements on terms less favorable
to our subsidiaries and our subsidiaries accept such terms, such unfavorable terms may have a material adverse effect on our subsidiaries 
business and our financial condition and results of operations. Accordingly, unless and until our subsidiaries diversify and expand their
customer base, our future success will significantly depend upon the timing and volume of business from our subsidiaries largest
customers and the financial and operational success of these customers. 

As our subsidiaries expand their operations,
they may need to establish a more diverse supplier network for raw materials. The failure to secure a more diverse supplier network could
have an adverse effect on our financial condition. 

In the event that our subsidiaries need to diversify
their supplier network, our subsidiaries may not be able to procure a sufficient supply of raw materials at a competitive price, which
could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Furthermore, despite our subsidiaries 
efforts to control their supply of raw materials and maintain good relationships with their existing suppliers, our subsidiaries could
lose one or more of their existing suppliers at any time. The loss of one or more key suppliers could increase our subsidiaries 
reliance on higher cost or lower quality supplies, which could negative affect our profitability. Any interruptions to, or decline in,
the amount or quality of our subsidiaries raw materials supply could materially disrupt our subsidiaries production and
adversely affect our subsidiaries business and our financial condition and financial prospects. 

To remain competitive, our subsidiaries
have introduced new lines of business, including the production and sale of electric industrial heavy equipment. If these efforts are
not successful, our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. 

Prior to December 2020, through Zhongchai Holding
and its PRC subsidiaries, our products mainly included transmission systems and integrated powertrains for material handling machineries,
particularly for electric forklift trucks. In December 2020, through HEVI, we launched a new division to focus on the production and sale
of electric industrial heavy equipment a division that Greenland intends to develop to diversify its product offerings. HEVI s
electric industrial heavy equipment products currently include GEF-series electric forklifts, a series of lithium powered forklifts with
three models ranging in size from 1.8 tons to 3.5 tons, GEL-1800, a 1.8 ton rated load lithium powered electric wheeled front loader,
GEX-8000, an all-electric 8.0 ton rated load lithium powered wheeled excavator, and GEL-5000, an all-electric 5.0 ton rated load lithium
wheeled front loader. HEVI also introduced mobile DC battery chargers to support a growing market of EV applications requiring DC charging
capabilities in the North America market. These products are available for purchase in the U.S. market. In August 2022, HEVI launched
a 54,000 square foot industrial electric vehicle assembly site in Baltimore, Maryland to support local services, assembly and distribution
of its electric industrial heavy equipment product line. In July 2024, HEVI announced a partnership with Lonking Holdings Limited to develop
and distribute heavy electric machinery and related technology specialized for the U.S. market. In August 2024, HEVI launched its H55L
all-electric wheeled front-end loader, which can lift up to six tons in indoor and outdoor applications without the mess and emissions
of diesel, and the H65L all-electric wheeled front-end loader, the largest lithium battery powered electric wheel loader commercially
available in North America. 

20 

There are risks in connection with this new line
of business. HEVI may experience difficulties in the development and launch of electric industrial heavy equipment, and HEVI s products
may not be well-accepted by the market. As we have limited experience in the electric industrial heavy equipment business, our efforts
in developing such business may not succeed and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to cover our investment and become profitable.
During such process, our results of operations and financial conditions may not be improved in a timely manner, or at all. We cannot assure
you that we will successfully transition our business focus and it is possible that we remain in such transition period for an extended
period of time. During such period, our revenue may be very limited and we may continue to experience material and adverse effects to
our results of operations, financial condition and business prospects. 

New lines of business, including the production
and sale of electric industrial heavy equipment, may subject us and our subsidiaries to additional risks. 

From time to time, we may implement new lines
of business or offer new products within our subsidiaries existing lines of business. Currently, we plan to offer additional models
of electric industrial heavy equipment through HEVI. As such, we face significant challenges, uncertainties and risks, including, among
others, with respect to our subsidiaries ability to: 

build a well-recognized and respected brand; 

establish and expand our customer base; 

improve and maintain our operational efficiency for new lines of business; 

maintain a reliable, secure, high-performance and scalable technology infrastructure for our new lines of business; 

anticipate and adapt to changing market conditions, including technological development and changes in competitive landscape; 

navigate an evolving and complex regulatory environment, such as licensing and compliance requirements; and 

manage the resources and attention of management between our current core business and new lines of business. 

Moreover, there can be no assurance that the introduction
and development of new lines of business or new products and services would not encounter significant difficulties or delay or would achieve
the profitability as we expect. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business
or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our subsidiaries business and our results of operations and
prospects. For example, HEVI may experience difficulties in developing and launching additional models of electric industrial heavy equipment,
or may not be able to develop them at reasonable costs. Due to HEVI s limited experience with electric industrial heavy equipment,
HEVI also face challenges and uncertainties relating to the possibility of success of this new business. 

As our subsidiaries enter into new business sectors,
our subsidiaries are also subject to competition from such industries. There can be no assurance that our subsidiaries will be able to
compete effectively with respect to their new businesses. If our subsidiaries fail to establish their strengths or maintain their competitiveness
in those industries, our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. 

Volatile steel prices can cause significant
fluctuations in our operating results. Our revenues and operating income could decrease if steel prices increase or if our subsidiaries
are unable to pass price increases on to their customers. 

Our subsidiaries principal raw materials
are processed metal parts and components which are made of carburizing steel. The steel industry as a whole is cyclical and, at times,
pricing and availability of steel can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond our subsidiaries control, including general domestic
and international economic conditions, labor costs, sales levels, competition, levels of inventory, consolidation of steel producers,
higher raw material costs for steel producers, import duties and tariffs and currency exchange rates. This volatility can significantly
affect the availability and cost of raw materials. 

21 

Our subsidiaries suppliers, like many other
processed metal parts and components manufacturers, maintain substantial inventories of steel to accommodate the short lead times and
just-in-time delivery requirements of customers. Accordingly, our subsidiaries suppliers purchase steel in an effort to maintain
their inventory at levels that they believe to be appropriate to satisfy the anticipated needs of customers based upon historic buying
practices, supply agreements with customers and market conditions. When steel prices increase, competitive conditions will influence how
much of the price increase suppliers would pass on to our subsidiaries and how much our subsidiaries can pass on to their customers. To
the extent our subsidiaries are unable to pass on future price increases in raw materials to their customers, the revenues and profitability
of our business could be adversely affected. 

We are subject to various risks and uncertainties
that might affect our subsidiaries ability to procure raw materials . 

Our performance depends upon our subsidiaries 
ability to procure low cost, high quality raw materials on a timely basis from their suppliers. Our subsidiaries suppliers are
subject to certain risks, including the availability of raw materials, labor disputes, inclement weather, natural disasters, and general
economic and political conditions, which might limit the ability of our subsidiaries suppliers to provide low cost, high quality
merchandise on a timely basis. Furthermore, for these or other reasons, one or more of our subsidiaries suppliers might not adhere
to our subsidiaries quality control standards, and our subsidiaries might not identify the deficiency. Any failure by our subsidiaries 
suppliers to supply quality materials at a reasonable cost on a timely basis could reduce our net sales or profits, damage our reputation
and have an adverse effect on our financial condition. 

Our subsidiaries may lose their competitive
advantage, and their operations may suffer, if we fail to prevent the loss or misappropriation of, or disputes over, their intellectual
property. 

Our subsidiaries rely on a combination of patents,
trademarks, trade secrets and confidentiality agreements to protect their intellectual property rights. While our subsidiaries are not
currently aware of any infringement on their intellectual property rights, our subsidiaries ability to compete successfully and
to achieve future revenue growth will depend, in significant part, on their ability to protect their proprietary technology. Despite many
laws and regulations promulgated, as well as other efforts made, by China over the past several years in an attempt to protect intellectual
property rights, intellectual property rights are not as certain in China as they would be in many Western countries, including the United
States. Furthermore, enforcement of such laws and regulations in China has not been fully developed. Neither the administrative agencies
nor the court systems in China are as equipped as their counterparts in developed countries to deal with violations or handle the nuances
and complexities between compliant technological innovation and non-compliant infringement. 

Our subsidiaries transmission technology
is protected through a combination of patents, trade secrets, confidentiality agreements and other methods. However, our subsidiaries 
competitors may independently develop similar proprietary methodologies or duplicate our products, or develop alternatives, which could
have a material adverse effect on our subsidiaries business and our results of operations and financial condition. The misappropriation
or duplication of our subsidiaries intellectual property could disrupt their ongoing business, distract our management and employees,
reduce our revenues and increase our expenses. Our subsidiaries may need to litigate to enforce their intellectual property rights. Any
such litigation could be time consuming and costly and the outcome of any such litigation cannot be guaranteed. 

22 

Our PRC subsidiaries have limited insurance
coverage for their operations in China and may incur losses resulting from product liability claims, business interruption or natural
disasters. 

HEVI, an operating subsidiary of ours in the U.S.,
maintains commercial general liability insurance for its business operations. However, our PRC subsidiaries have limited insurance coverage
for their operations in China, and our PRC subsidiaries are therefore exposed to risks associated with product liability claims against
our PRC subsidiaries or otherwise against their operations in the PRC in the event that the use of our PRC subsidiaries products
results in property damage or personal injury. Since our subsidiaries transmission products are ultimately incorporated into forklifts,
it is possible that users of forklifts or people installing these products could be injured or killed, whether as a result of defects,
improper installation or other causes. We are unable to predict whether product liability claims will be brought against our PRC subsidiaries
in the future or to predict the impact of any resulting adverse publicity on our PRC subsidiaries business. The successful assertion
of product liability claims against our PRC subsidiaries could result in potentially significant monetary damages and require us to make
significant payments. Our subsidiaries do not carry product liability insurance and may not have adequate resources to satisfy a judgment
in the event of a successful claim against us. In addition, our subsidiaries do not currently, and may not in the future, maintain business
interruption insurance coverage. As such, our subsidiaries may suffer losses that result from interruptions in their operations as a result
of inability to operate or failures of equipment and infrastructure at our subsidiaries facilities. Our subsidiaries also do not
currently maintain catastrophe insurance. As such, any natural disaster or man-made disaster could result in substantial losses and diversion
of our subsidiaries resources to address the effects of such an occurrence, which could materially and adversely affect our subsidiaries 
business and our financial condition and results of operations. 

Failure to make adequate contributions to
various employee benefit plans as required by PRC regulations may subject us to penalties. 

Our PRC subsidiaries are required under PRC laws
to participate in various government sponsored employee benefit plans, including social security insurance, housing funds and other welfare-oriented
payments, and contribute to the plans in amounts equal to certain percentages of salaries, including bonuses and allowances, of their
employees up to a maximum amount specified by the local government from time to time at locations where our PRC subsidiaries operate their
businesses. Our PRC subsidiaries have not made adequate employee benefit payments to the social security insurance and the housing fund.
As a result, they may be required to make up the contributions for these plans within a stipulated period of time. In addition, our PRC
subsidiaries may be required to pay late fees equal to 0.05 of the shortage of the contributions to the social security fund for each
day our PRC subsidiaries fail to make up the contributions and may be imposed fines up to three times of such shortage if our PRC subsidiaries
fail to make up the difference within the time frame prescribed by relevant government authorities. The maximum amount of such penalties
that we anticipate could be imposed on our PRC subsidiaries with respect such employee benefits payments is approximately US 200,000.
If our PRC subsidiaries are subject to late fees or fines in relation to the underpaid employee benefits, our financial condition and
results of operations may be adversely affected. As of the date of this Report, our PRC subsidiaries have not been ordered to pay outstanding
contributions or related penalties. 

If labor costs in the PRC increase substantially,
our PRC subsidiaries business and our costs of operations may be adversely affected. 

In recent years, the Chinese economy has experienced
inflation and labor cost increases. Average wages are projected to continue to increase. Further, under PRC law an employer is required
to pay various statutory employee benefits, including pensions, housing funds, medical insurance, work-related injury insurance,
unemployment insurance and maternity insurance to designated government agencies for the benefit of its employees. The relevant government
agencies may examine whether an employer has made adequate payments to the statutory employee benefits, and those employers who fail to
make adequate payments may be subject to late payment fees, fines and/or other penalties. We expect that our labor costs, including wages
and employee benefits, will continue to increase based on the past trends. If we are unable to control our labor costs or pass such increased
labor costs on to our subsidiaries customers, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. 

23 

We may not be able to effectively protect
our intellectual property from unauthorized use by others. 

Through its subsidiaries, we hold patents, trademarks
and other intellectual properties that are critical to our business in the PRC. Any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged,
invalidated, circumvented or misappropriated, or such intellectual property may not be sufficient to provide us with competitive advantages.
We cannot assure you that (i) all of the intellectual property rights we owned will be adequately protected, or (ii) our intellectual
property rights will not be challenged by third parties or found by a judicial authority to be invalid or unenforceable. Moreover, there
can be no assurance that we will obtain such trademarks and any other trademarks that are crucial to our business in the future. Thus,
third parties may also take the position that we are infringing their rights, and we may not be successful in defending these claims.
Additionally, we may not be able to enforce and defend its proprietary rights or prevent infringement or misappropriation, without incurring
substantial expenses to us and a significant diversion of management time and attention from our business strategy. 

To protect our parents, trademarks and other proprietary
rights, we reply on and expect to continue to rely on a combination of physical and electronic security measures and trademark, patent
and trade secret protection laws. If the measures we have taken to protect our proprietary rights are inadequate to prevent the use or
misappropriation by third parties or such rights are diminished due to successful challenges, the value of our brand and other intangible
assets may be diminished and our ability to attract and retain customers may be adversely affected. 

Competition for our and our subsidiaries 
employees is intense, and we and our subsidiaries may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees needed to support
our subsidiaries business. 

As we continue to experience growth, our future
success depends on our and our subsidiaries ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees,
including engineers, financial personnel and marketing professionals. Competition for highly skilled engineering, sales, technical and
financial personnel is extremely intense. We and our subsidiaries may not be able to hire and retain these personnel at compensation levels
consistent with our existing compensation and salary structure. Many of the companies with which we and our subsidiaries compete for experienced
employees have greater resources than we and our subsidiaries have and may be able to offer more attractive terms of employment. 

In addition, we and our subsidiaries invest significant
time and expense in training our employees, which increases their value to competitors who may seek to recruit them. If we and our subsidiaries
fail to retain our employees, we could incur significant expenses in hiring and training their replacements, and the quality of our products
could decrease, resulting in a material adverse effect on our subsidiaries business. 

Our business depends on the continued efforts
of our senior management. If one or more of our key executives were unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, our business
may be severely disrupted. 

Our business operations depend on the continuing
services of our senior management. While we have provided different incentives to our management, we cannot assure you that we can continue
to retain their services. If one or more of our key executives were unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, we may
not be able to replace them easily or at all, our future growth may be constrained, business may be severely disrupted and our financial
condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected, and we may incur additional expenses to recruit, train and
retain qualified personnel. In addition, although we have entered into a non-competition agreement with Mr. Peter Zuguang Wang, the chairman
of our board of directors, there is no assurance that Mr. Wang will not join our competitors or form a competing business. If any dispute
arises between us and Mr. Wang, we may incur substantial costs and expenses in order to enforce the non-competition agreement in China,
and we may be unable to enforce it at all. 

We do not maintain key person 
insurance, and as a result, we may incur losses if any of our directors, executive officers, senior manager or other key employees chooses
to terminate his or her services with us. 

We do not maintain key person insurance
for our directors, executive officers, senior management or other key employees. If any of our key employees terminate his or her services
or otherwise becomes unable to provide continuous services to us, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially
and adversely affected and we may incur additional expenses to recruit, train and retain qualified personnel. If any of our executive
officers or key employees joins a competitor or forms a competing company, we may lose customers, operational know-how and key professionals
and staff members. 

24 

We are currently operating in a period of
economic uncertainty and capital markets disruption, which has been significantly impacted by geopolitical instability due to the ongoing
invasion of Ukraine by Russia and conflicts between Israel and Hamas. 

U.S. and global markets are experiencing volatility
and disruption as a result of the outbreak or escalation of wards including Russia s launch of a full-scale military invasion of
Ukraine, conflicts between Israel and Hamas. Although the length and impact of these ongoing conflicts are highly unpredictable, these
conflicts have led to market disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices, credit, and capital markets. In addition,
as a result of the ongoing conflicts around the world, we may experience other risks, difficulties and challenges in the way we conduct
our business and operations generally. For example, the conflict could adversely affect supply chains and impact our ability to control
raw material costs. A protracted conflict between Ukraine and Russia or between Israel and Hamas, any escalation of either conflict,
and the wider global economy and market conditions could, in turn, have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition,
cash flows and results of operations and could cause the market value of our ordinary shares to decline. 

High inflation rates may adversely affect
us by increasing costs beyond what we can recover through price increases and limit our ability to enter into future traditional debt
financing. 

Inflation can adversely affect us by increasing
costs of critical materials, equipment, labor, and other services. In addition, inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates.
Continued inflationary pressures could impact our profitability. Inflation may also affect our ability to enter into future traditional
debt financing, as high inflation may result in an increase in cost. 

The outcome of litigation, inquiries, investigations,
examinations, or other legal proceedings in which we are involved, in which we may become involved, or in which our clients or competitors
are involved could distract management, increase our expenses, or subject us to significant monetary damages or restrictions on our ability
to do business. 

From time to time, we are subject to litigations
or legal proceedings in connection with our business operations. The scope and outcome of these proceedings is often difficult to assess
or quantify. Plaintiffs in lawsuits may seek recovery of large amounts, and the cost to defend such litigation may be significant. 

For example, on April 26, 2024, all of the Company s
current directors, the Company s chief executive officer, and the Company s controlling shareholder, Cenntro Holding Limited,
were named as defendants (collectively, the Defendants ), and the Company was named as a nominal defendant in a shareholder
derivate action filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The compliant assets, inter alia, that Defendants
breached their fiduciary duties owed to the Company, committed waste and violated Section 16(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of
1934, as amended. The complainant seeks: (i) on behalf of the Company, monetary damages of no less than 38,060,365; (ii) to restrict
Mr. Peter Wang, the chairman of the Company s board of directors from selling ordinary shares of the Company until Cenntro Holding
Limited has paid off its amount due to the Company and setting up a trust over any future funds from sales of the Company s ordinary
shares by Mr. Peter Wang or Cenntro Holding Limited; (iii) that the Defendants disgorge profits obtained as a result of their wrongful
conduct; (iv) to enjoin of the Company s proposed spin-off transaction; (v) attorney fees and costs; and (vi) any other relief the
court may deem just and proper. 

On June 28, 2024, the Company s board of
directors held a board meeting, during which the directors of the Company unanimously approved a decision to terminate its previously
announced plan of spinning off its drivetrain systems segment. After due diligence review, the Company s board of directors has
identified that the spin-off would likely not generate significant value to its shareholders due to changing market conditions. On July
8, 2024, the Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the shareholder derivative action. 

Any negative outcomes from above material litigation
or any other regulatory actions or litigation or claims, including monetary penalties or damages or injunctive provisions regulating or
restricting how we conduct our business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations
and reputation. Regardless of whether any current or future claims in which we are involved have merit, or whether we are ultimately held
liable or subject to payment of penalties, such investigations and claims have been and may continue to be expensive to defend, may divert
management s time away from our operations and may result in changes to our business practices that adversely affect our results
of operations.

Risks Related to Doing Business in China 

Changes in China s economic, political
or social conditions or government policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. 

A substantial majority of our assets and operations
are located in China. Accordingly, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be influenced to a significant
degree by political, economic and social conditions in China generally. The PRC economy differs from the economies of most developed countries
in many respects, including with regard to the level of government involvement, level of development, growth rate, control of foreign
exchange and allocation of resources. Although the PRC government has implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces
for economic reform, the reduction of state ownership of productive assets, and the establishment of improved corporate governance in
business enterprises, a substantial portion of productive assets in China is still owned by the government. In addition, the PRC government
continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies. 

The PRC government also exercises significant
control over China s economic growth through allocating resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations,
setting monetary policy, and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies. 

While the PRC economy has experienced significant
growth over the past decades, growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy, and the rate of growth
has been slowing since 2012. Any adverse changes in economic conditions in China, in the policies of the PRC government or in the laws
and regulations in China could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of China. Such developments could adversely
affect our business and operating results, lead to reduction in demand for our subsidiaries products and adversely affect our subsidiaries 
competitive position. The PRC government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources.
Some of these measures may benefit the overall PRC economy, but may have a negative effect on us and our subsidiaries. For example, our
financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax
regulations. In addition, in the past the PRC government has implemented certain measures, including interest rate adjustment, to control
the pace of economic growth. These measures may cause decreased economic activity in China, which may adversely affect our business and
operating results. 

Uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal
system could adversely affect us and our PRC subsidiaries. 

The PRC legal system is a civil law system based
on written statutes. Unlike the common law system, prior court decisions under the civil law system may be cited for reference but have
limited precedential value. Since these laws and regulations are relatively new and the PRC legal system continues to rapidly evolve,
the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules are not always uniform and the enforcement of these laws, regulations and rules
involves uncertainties. 

In 1979, the PRC government began to promulgate
a comprehensive system of laws and regulations governing economic matters in general. The overall effect of legislation over the past
four decades has significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in China. However, China has
not developed a fully integrated legal system, and recently enacted laws and regulations may not sufficiently cover all aspects of economic
activities in China. In particular, the interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations involve uncertainties. Since PRC
administrative and court authorities have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory provisions and contractual
terms, it may be difficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative and court proceedings and the level of legal protection we enjoy.
These uncertainties may affect our and/or our PRC subsidiaries judgment on the relevance of legal requirements and our/our PRC
subsidiaries ability to enforce our/their contractual rights or tort claims. In addition, the regulatory uncertainties may be exploited
through unmerited or frivolous legal actions or threats in attempts to extract payments or benefits from us and our PRC subsidiaries. 

Furthermore, the PRC legal system is based in
part on government policies and internal rules, some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all and may have retroactive effect.
As a result, we and/or our PRC subsidiaries may not be aware of our/their violation of any of these policies and rules until sometime
after the violation. In addition, any administrative and court proceedings in China may be protracted, resulting in substantial costs
and diversion of resources and management attention. 

In addition, we and our PRC subsidiaries are subject
to risks and uncertainties of the interpretations and applications of PRC laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, limitations
on foreign ownership in the industry our PRC subsidiaries operate. We and our PRC subsidiaries are also subject to the risks and uncertainties
about any future actions of the PRC government. If any future actions of the PRC government result in a material change in our operations,
and the value of our ordinary shares may depreciate significantly or become worthless. 

26 

The PRC government exerts substantial influence
over the manner in which our PRC subsidiaries must conduct their business activities. If the Chinese government significantly regulates
the business operations of our PRC subsidiaries in the future and our PRC subsidiaries are not able to substantially comply with such
regulations, the business operations of our PRC subsidiaries may be materially and adversely affected and the value of our ordinary shares
may significantly decrease. 

The PRC government has exercised, and continues
to exercise, substantial control over virtually every sector of the Chinese economy through regulation and state ownership, including
steel sector where our PRC subsidiaries have been doing their business. Any government decisions or actions to change the way steel production
is regulated, or any decisions the government might make to cut spending, could adversely impact our PRC subsidiaries business
and our results of operations. In addition, the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to operate in China may be harmed by changes in PRC laws
and regulations, including those relating to taxation, environmental conditions, land use rights, property and other matters. The central
or local governments of these jurisdictions may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would
require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations. Accordingly,
government actions in the future, including any decision not to continue to support recent economic reforms and to return to a more centrally
planned economy or regional or local variations in the implementation of economic policies, could have a significant effect on economic
conditions in China or particular regions thereof, and could require us to divest ourselves of any interest we then hold in Chinese properties. 

We believe that our PRC subsidiaries operations
in China are in material compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the central or local governments of
the jurisdictions in which our PRC subsidiaries operate may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations
with little advance notice that would require additional expenditures and efforts on their part to ensure our subsidiaries compliance
with such regulations or interpretations. 

Our PRC subsidiaries may incur increased costs
necessary to comply with existing and newly adopted laws and regulations or penalties for any failure to comply. In the event that our
PRC subsidiaries are not able to substantially comply with any existing or newly adopted laws and regulations, our business operations
may be materially adversely affected and the value of our ordinary shares may significantly decrease. 

Furthermore, the PRC government authorities may
strengthen oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers like us.
Such actions taken by the PRC government authorities may intervene or influence the operations of our PRC subsidiaries at any time, which
may be beyond our control. Therefore, any such action may adversely affect the operations of our PRC subsidiaries and substantially limit
or hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to you and significantly reduce the value of such securities or cause the
value of such securities to be completely worthless. 

We are required under PRC laws to submit
filings to CSRC for our future offerings. However, we believe that we and our PRC subsidiaries are not currently required to obtain the
approval and/or comply with other requirements of the CSRC, the CAC, or other PRC governmental authorities under PRC rules, regulations
or policies in connection with our continued listing on Nasdaq. In the event that any such approval is required or that there are other
requirements we and/or our PRC subsidiaries are obligated to comply with, we cannot predict whether or how soon we and/or our PRC subsidiaries
will be able to obtain such approvals and/or comply with such requirements. 

The Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of
Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, or the M A Rules, purport to require offshore special purpose vehicles that are controlled
by PRC companies or individuals and that have been formed for the purpose of seeking a public listing on an overseas stock exchange through
acquisitions of PRC domestic companies or assets to obtain CSRC approval prior to publicly listing their securities on an overseas stock
exchange. The interpretation and application of those regulations remain unclear. 

27 

In addition, the PRC government authorities may
strengthen future oversight over offerings that are conducted overseas. For instance, on July 6, 2021, the relevant PRC governmental authorities
promulgated the Opinions on Strictly Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities, which emphasized the need to strengthen the PRC government s
supervision over overseas listings by PRC companies. Pursuant to the Opinions, effective measures, such as promoting the construction
of relevant regulatory systems, are to be taken to deal with the risks of China-based overseas-listed companies, cybersecurity and data
privacy protection requirements and similar matters. The Cybersecurity Review Measures (Decree No. 8 of the Cybersecurity Administration
of the PRC), or the revised Cybersecurity Review Measures, enacted on December 28, 2021 and came into effect on February 15, 2022, also
require online platform operators holding over one million users personal information to apply for a cybersecurity review before
any public offering on a foreign stock exchange. These statements and regulations are recently issued, and there remain substantial uncertainties
about their interpretation and implementation. See also Our PRC subsidiaries may be liable for improper use or appropriation
of personal information provided by their customers and any failure to comply with PRC laws and regulations over data security could result
in materially adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and our continued listing on Nasdaq. 

On February 17, 2023, the CSRC published the Regulations
of Trial Administrative Measures of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (the Trial Measures and its accompanying guidelines and instructions, which came into effect on March 31, 2023, and will apply if a domestic enterprise issues
shares, depositary receipts, corporate bonds convertible into shares, or other securities of an equity nature outside of the PRC, or lists
its securities for trading outside of the PRC. According to such regulations, a domestic enterprise that issues and lists its securities
outside of the PRC shall comply with the filing procedures and report the relevant information to the CSRC. A domestic enterprise shall
not be listed on an overseas stock exchange if any of the following circumstances exists: (i) where such securities offering and listing
is explicitly prohibited by provisions in laws, administrative regulations and relevant state rules; (ii) where the intended securities
offering and listing may endanger national security as reviewed and determined by competent authorities under the State Council in accordance
with law; (iii) where the domestic company intending to make the securities offering and listing, or its controlling shareholders and
the actual controller, have committed crimes such as corruption, bribery, embezzlement, misappropriation of property or undermining the
order of the socialist market economy during the latest three years; (iv) where the domestic company intending to make the securities
offering and listing is suspected of committing crimes or major violations of laws and regulations, and is under investigation according
to law, and no conclusion has yet been made thereof; (v) where there are material ownership disputes over equity held by the domestic
company s controlling shareholder or by other shareholders that are controlled by the controlling shareholder and/or actual controller.
The Trial Measures changes the management of licensing to record management, strengthen the supervision in the aftermath, create a more
transparent and predictable institutional environment, and support the standardized development of enterprises using the overseas capital
market. 

According to the Notice on Filing Management Arrangements
for Overseas Listings of Domestic Enterprises issued and implemented by the CSRC on February 17, 2023, since the date of effectiveness
of the Trial Measures, the domestic enterprises falling within the scope of filing that have been listed overseas or met the following
circumstances are existing enterprises: Before the effectiveness of the Trial Measures, the application for indirect overseas issuance
and listing has been agreed by the overseas regulators or overseas stock exchanges (such as having passed the hearing on the Hong Kong
market or registration become effective as agreed on the U.S. market, etc.), and it is not required to perform issuance and listing supervision
procedures of the overseas regulators or overseas stock exchanges (such as rehearing on the Hong Kong market, etc.), and the overseas
issuance and listing will be completed by September 30, 2023. According to the above regulations, the Company is an existing enterprise,
which do not be required to file immediately, and filing should be made as required if they involve refinancing and other filing matters. 

As of the date of this Report, we believe we and
our PRC subsidiaries are not required to obtain any permission from PRC authorities (including the CSRC and the CAC) to operate our PRC
subsidiaries business as presently conducted or listing on Nasdaq. Therefore, as of the date of this Report, we and our PRC subsidiaries
have not applied for any permission or approval from any PRC governmental authority in connection with our offshore listing or offering
and, as such, no such permission or approval has been granted or denied. However, if it fails to comply with the Trial Measures during
future issuance of securities or listing on other stock exchanges outside of China, we may be subjected sanctions imposed by the PRC regulatory
authorities, and our reputation, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. 

To the extent cash in the business is in
the PRC/Hong Kong or a PRC/Hong Kong entity, the funds may not be available to fund operations or for other use outside of the PRC/Hong
Kong due to interventions in or the imposition of restrictions and limitations on the ability of our Company or our subsidiaries by the
PRC government to transfer cash. 

Relevant mainland PRC laws and regulations permit
the companies in mainland China to pay dividends only out of their respective retained earnings, if any, as determined in accordance with
mainland China accounting standards and regulations. Additionally, each of the companies in mainland China are required to set aside at
least 10 of its after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a statutory reserve until such reserve reaches 50 of its registered
capital. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. Furthermore, in order for us to pay dividends to our shareholders, we
may rely on payments made from our mainland PRC subsidiaries to their respective shareholders and then to our Company. If our these entities
incur debt on their own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other
payments to us. 

28 

Our cash dividends, if any, will be paid in U.S. dollars.
If we are considered a tax resident enterprise of mainland China for tax purposes, any dividends we pay to our overseas shareholders may
be regarded as mainland China-sourced income and as a result may be subject to mainland PRC withholding tax. See Risks
Related to Doing Business in China Under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, we may
be classified as a Resident Enterprise of China. Such classification will likely result in unfavorable tax consequences
to us and our non-PRC shareholders. The PRC government also imposes controls on the convertibility of Renminbi into foreign
currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of mainland China. Shortages in foreign currencies may restrict our ability
to pay dividends or other payments, or otherwise satisfy our foreign currency denominated obligations, if any. Under existing PRC foreign
exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and expenditures from trade-related transactions,
can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange as long as certain procedural
requirements are met. Approval from appropriate government authorities is required if Renminbi is converted into foreign currency and
remitted out of mainland China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies. The PRC government
may, at its discretion, impose restrictions on access to foreign currencies for current account transactions and if this occurs in the
future, we may not be able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to our shareholders. 

As of the date of this Report, there are no restrictions
or limitations imposed by the Hong Kong government on the transfer of capital within, into, and out of Hong Kong (including
funds from Hong Kong to mainland China), except for the transfer of funds involving money laundering and criminal activities. However,
there is no guarantee that the Hong Kong government will not promulgate new laws or regulations that may impose such restrictions
in the future. If there is a significant change to current political arrangements between mainland China and Hong Kong, or the applicable
laws, regulations, or interpretations change, our Hong Kong subsidiary may become subject to PRC laws or authorities. As a result,
our Hong Kong subsidiary could be subject to similar government controls on the convertibility of foreign currency and the remittance
of currency out of Hong Kong as described above. 

As a result of the above, to the extent cash in
the business is in the PRC/Hong Kong or a PRC/Hong Kong entity, such funds or assets may not be available to fund operations or for
other use outside of the PRC/Hong Kong, due to interventions in or the imposition of restrictions and limitations on the ability
of us or our subsidiaries by the competent government to the transfer of cash. 

Our PRC subsidiaries may be liable for improper
use or appropriation of personal information provided by their customers and any failure to comply with PRC laws and regulations over
data security could result in materially adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and our continued listing on Nasdaq. 

Our PRC subsidiaries business involves
collecting and retaining certain internal and customer data. Our PRC subsidiaries also maintain information about various aspects of their
operations. The integrity and protection of customer and company data is critical to our business. Our subsidiaries customers expect
that our subsidiaries will adequately protect their personal information. Our PRC subsidiaries are required by applicable laws to keep
strictly confidential the personal information that they collect, and to take adequate security measures to safeguard such information. 

The PRC Criminal Law, as amended by its Amendment
7 (effective on February 28, 2009) and Amendment 9 (effective on November 1, 2015), prohibits institutions, companies and their employees
from selling or otherwise illegally disclosing a citizen s personal information obtained in performing duties or providing services
or obtaining such information through theft or other illegal ways. On November 7, 2016, the Standing Committee of the PRC National People s
Congress issued the Cyber Security Law of the PRC, or Cyber Security Law, which became effective on June 1, 2017. Pursuant to the Cyber
Security Law, network operators must not, without users consent, collect their personal information, and may only collect users 
personal information necessary to provide their services. Providers are also obliged to provide security maintenance for their products
and services and shall comply with provisions regarding the protection of personal information as stipulated under the relevant laws and
regulations. 

The Civil Code of the PRC (issued by the PRC National
People s Congress on May 28, 2020 and effective from January 1, 2021) provides the legal basis for privacy and personal information
infringement claims under the Chinese civil laws. PRC regulators, including the CAC, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology,
and the Ministry of Public Security, have been increasingly focused on regulation in data security and data protection. 

The PRC regulatory requirements regarding cybersecurity
are evolving. For instance, various regulatory bodies in China, including the CAC, the Ministry of Public Security and the State Administration
for Market Regulation, have enforced data privacy and protection laws and regulations with varying and evolving standards and interpretations.
In April 2020, the Chinese government promulgated Cybersecurity Review Measures, which came into effect on June 1, 2020. According to
the Cybersecurity Review Measures, operators of critical information infrastructure must pass a cybersecurity review when purchasing network
products and services which do or may affect national security. 

In December 2021, the CAC and other related authorities
promulgated the revised Cybersecurity Review Measures, which came into effect on February 15, 2022. The revised Cybersecurity Review Measures
propose the following key changes: 

online platform operators who are engaged in data processing are also subject to the regulatory scope; 

the CSRC is included as one of the regulatory authorities for purposes of jointly establishing the state cybersecurity review working mechanism; 

the online platform operators holding more than one million users individual information and seeking a listing outside China shall file for cybersecurity review with the Cybersecurity Review Office; and 

the risks of core data, material data or large amounts of personal information being stolen, leaked, destroyed, damaged, illegally used or transmitted to overseas parties and the risks of critical information infrastructure, core data, material data or large amounts of personal information being influenced, controlled or used maliciously shall be collectively taken into consideration during the cybersecurity review process. 

29 

Certain internet platforms in China have reportedly
become subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny in relation to cybersecurity matters. As of the date of this Report, we have not been
included within the definition of operator of critical information infrastructure by a competent authority, nor have we
been informed by any PRC governmental authority of any requirement that we file for a cybersecurity review. However, if we are deemed
to be a critical information infrastructure operator or an online platform operator that is engaged in data processing and holds personal
information of more than one million users, we could be subject to PRC cybersecurity review in the future. 

As there remains significant uncertainty in the
interpretation and enforcement of relevant PRC cybersecurity laws and regulations, we could be subject to cybersecurity review. In addition,
we could become subject to enhanced cybersecurity review or investigations launched by PRC regulators in the future. Any failure or delay
in the completion of the cybersecurity review procedures or any other non-compliance with the related laws and regulations may result
in fines or other penalties, including suspension of business, website closure and revocation of prerequisite licenses, as well as reputational
damage or legal proceedings or actions against us and/or our PRC subsidiaries, which may have material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition or results of operations. As of the date of this Report, we and our PRC subsidiaries have not been involved in any
investigations on cybersecurity review initiated by the CAC or related governmental regulatory authorities, and we and our PRC subsidiaries
have not received any inquiry, notice, warning, or sanction in such respect. 

On June 10, 2021, the Standing Committee of the
National People s Congress of China, or the SCNPC, promulgated the PRC Data Security Law, which took effect in September 2021. The
PRC Data Security Law imposes data security and privacy obligations on entities and individuals carrying out data activities, and introduces
a data classification and hierarchical protection system based on the importance of data in economic and social development, and the degree
of harm it will cause to national security, public interests, or legitimate rights and interests of individuals or organizations when
such data is tampered with, destroyed, leaked, illegally acquired or used. The PRC Data Security Law also provides for a national security
review procedure for data activities that may affect national security and imposes export restrictions on certain data an information. 

As of the date of this Report, we do not expect
that the current PRC laws on cybersecurity or data security would have a material adverse impact on our business operations. However,
as the scope of the PRC Data Security Law is broad and includes the collection, storage, use, processing, transmission, availability and
disclosure of data, among others, and uncertainties remain regarding the interpretation and implementation of these laws and regulations,
we cannot assure you that we and our PRC subsidiaries will comply with such regulations in all respects and we and/or our PRC subsidiaries
may be ordered to rectify or terminate any actions that are deemed illegal by regulatory authorities. Any directly liable person within
our Company for violations or alleged violations of the PRC Data Security Law may become subject to fines. We and/or our PRC subsidiaries
may also become subject to fines and/or other sanctions that may have material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial
condition. 

On September 24, 2024, the CAC released the Administrative
Regulations on the Network Data Security, or the Data Security Regulations, which will become effective on January 1, 2025. The Data Security
Regulations may apply to the use of networks to carry out data processing activities and the supervision and administration of network
data security in mainland China and apply to activities outside mainland China to process personal information of any natural persons
in mainland China under any of the following circumstances: (i) for the purpose of providing products or services to natural persons in
mainland China; (ii) analyze and evaluate the behavior of natural persons in mainland China; and (iii) other circumstances stipulated
by laws and administrative regulations. The Data Security Regulations further stipulate that where it is indeed necessary to transfer
 important data collected and generated by a network data processor during its operation within the territory of mainland
China to overseas parties, it shall pass the security assessment for cross-border data transfer organized by the CAC. Network data processors
should identify and declare important data in accordance with the relevant provisions, but they are not required to conduct
security assessment for outbound data transfer for data that has not been notified or published as important data by relevant
departments or regions. In addition, the Data Security Regulations provides that data processors that process important data 
must conduct an annual data security assessment with regard to the data process activities, and submit the assessment report to relevant
competent authorities at or above the provincial level. Since the Data Security Regulations is newly promulgated, there remains uncertainty
as to how it will be implemented and interpreted by the competent authorities and whether the PRC regulatory agencies, including the CAC,
will adopt new laws, regulations, rules, or detailed implementation and interpretation related to security assessment. We cannot predict
the impact of the Data Security Regulations on us, if any, at this stage, and we will closely monitor and assess any development in the
implementation and interpretation of the Data Security Regulations. Even though we do not believe our business activities fall under the
scope of Data Security Regulations, in the event that a competent PRC governmental authority concludes otherwise, we face uncertainties
as to whether such clearance can be timely obtained, or at all.

A severe or prolonged downturn in the PRC
or global economy could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition. 

The global macroeconomic environment is facing
challenges. There is considerable uncertainty over the long-term effects of the expansionary monetary and fiscal policies adopted
by the central banks and financial authorities of some of the world s leading economies, including the United States and China.
There have been concerns over unrest and terrorist threats in the Middle East, Europe and Africa and over the conflicts involving Ukraine,
Syria, Russia and North Korea. There have also been concerns on the relationship among China and other Asian countries, which may result
in, or intensify potential conflicts in relation to, territorial disputes, and the trade disputes between China and other countries. It
is unclear whether these challenges and uncertainties will be contained or resolved, and what effects they may have on the global political
and economic conditions in the long term. 

Economic conditions in China are sensitive to
global economic conditions, changes in domestic economic and political policies and the expected or perceived overall economic growth
rate in China. While the economy in China has grown significantly over the past decades, growth has been uneven, both geographically and
among various sectors of the economy, and the rate of growth has been slowing in recent years. Although growth of China s economy
remained relatively stable, there is a possibility that China s economic growth may materially decline in the near future. Any severe
or prolonged slowdown in the global or PRC economy may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial
condition. 

You may have difficulty enforcing judgments
against us. 

A significant portion of our assets are located,
and a substantial amount of our subsidiaries operations are conducted, in the PRC. In addition, some of our directors and officers
are nationals or residents of the PRC, including our chief financial officer, Mr. Jing Jin, and independent director, Mr. Ming Zhao, and
a substantial majority of their assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult to effect service of process
within the United States upon these persons. In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the PRC would recognize or
enforce judgments of U.S. courts because China does not have any treaties or other arrangements that provide for the reciprocal recognition
and enforcement of foreign judgments with the United States. In addition, according to the PRC Civil Procedures Law, courts in the PRC
will not enforce a foreign judgment against us or our directors and officers if they decide that the judgment violates basic principles
of PRC law or national sovereignty, security, or the public interest. 

Under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law,
we may be classified as a Resident Enterprise of China. Any classification as such will likely result in unfavorable tax
consequences to us and our non-PRC shareholders. 

Under the PRC EIT Law, an enterprise established
outside of China with de facto management bodies within China is considered a resident enterprise, meaning
that it can be subject to an enterprise income tax, or EIT, rate of 25.0 on its global income. In April 2009, the SAT promulgated a circular,
known as Circular 82, and partially amended by Circular 9 promulgated in January 2014, to clarify the certain criteria for the determination
of the de facto management bodies for foreign enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC enterprise groups. Under
Circular 82, a foreign enterprise is considered a PRC resident enterprise if all of the following apply: (1) the senior management and
core management departments in charge of daily operations are located mainly within China; (2) decisions relating to the enterprise s
financial and human resource matters are made or subject to approval by organizations or personnel in China; (3) the enterprise s
primary assets, accounting books and records, company seals, and board and shareholders meeting minutes are located or maintained
in China; and (4) 50.0 or more of voting board members or senior executives of the enterprise habitually reside in China. Further to
Circular 82, the SAT issued a bulletin, known as Bulletin 45, effective in September 2011 and amended on June 1, 2015 and October 1, 2016,
to provide more guidance on the implementation of Circular 82 and clarify the reporting and filing obligations of such Chinese
controlled offshore incorporated resident enterprises. Bulletin 45 provides for, among other matters, procedures for the determination
of resident status and administration of post-determination matters. Although Circular 82 and Bulletin 45 explicitly provide that the
above standards apply to enterprises that are registered outside China and controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC enterprise groups, Circular
82 may reflect the SAT s criteria for determining the tax residence of foreign enterprises in general. 

31 

If the PRC tax authorities determine that we are
a resident enterprise for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, a number of unfavorable PRC tax consequences could follow.
First, we may be subject to the enterprise income tax at a rate of 25 on our worldwide taxable income as well as PRC enterprise income
tax reporting obligations. In our case, this would mean that income such as non-China source income would be subject to PRC enterprise
income tax at a rate of 25 . Second, under the PRC EIT Law, dividends paid to us from our PRC subsidiaries would be deemed as qualified
investment income between resident enterprises and therefore qualify as tax-exempt income pursuant to the clause
26 of the PRC EIT Law. Finally, it is possible that future guidance issued with respect to the new resident enterprise classification
could result in a situation in which the dividends we pay with respect to our ordinary shares, or the gain our non-PRC shareholders may
realize from the transfer of our ordinary shares, may be treated as PRC-sourced income and may therefore be subject to a 10 PRC withholding
tax. The PRC EIT Law is, however, relatively new and ambiguities exist with respect to the interpretation and identification of PRC-sourced
income, and the application and assessment of withholding taxes. If we are required under the PRC EIT Law to withhold PRC income tax on
dividends payable to our non-PRC shareholders, should there be a determination in the future to pay dividends, or if non-PRC shareholders
are required to pay PRC income tax on gains on the transfer of their ordinary shares, our business could be negatively impacted and the
value of your investment may be materially reduced. Further, if we were treated as a resident enterprise by PRC tax authorities,
we would be subject to taxation in both China and such countries in which we have taxable income, and our PRC tax may not be creditable
against such other taxes. 

PRC regulation of loans to, and direct investments
in, PRC entities by offshore holding companies may delay or prevent us from using proceeds from our future financing activities to make
loans or additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries. 

As an offshore holding company with PRC subsidiaries,
we may transfer funds to our PRC subsidiaries or finance our PRC entities by means of loans or capital contributions. Any capital contributions
or loans that we, as an offshore entity, make to our PRC subsidiaries, are subject to PRC regulations. Any loans to our PRC subsidiaries,
which are foreign-invested enterprises, cannot exceed statutory limits based on the difference between the amount of our investments and
registered capital in such subsidiaries, and shall be registered with State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, or its local
counterparts. Furthermore, any capital increase contributions we make to our PRC subsidiaries, which are foreign-invested enterprises,
are subject to the requirement of making necessary reports in Foreign Investment Comprehensive Management Information System, and registration
with other government authorities in China. We may not be able to obtain these government registrations or approvals on a timely basis,
if at all. If we fail to obtain such approvals or make such registration, our ability to make equity contributions or provide loans to
our PRC subsidiaries or to fund their operations may be negatively affected, which may adversely affect their liquidity and ability to
fund their working capital and expansion projects and meet their obligations and commitments. As a result, our liquidity and our ability
to fund and expand our business may be negatively affected. 

We may rely on dividends paid by our subsidiaries
for our cash needs, and any limitation on the ability of our subsidiaries to make payments to us could have a material adverse effect
on our ability to conduct business. 

As a holding company, we conduct a substantial
amount of our business through our subsidiaries in China. We may rely on dividends paid by these PRC subsidiaries for our cash needs,
including the funds necessary to pay any dividends and other cash distributions to our shareholders, to service any debt we may incur
and to pay our operating expenses. The payment of dividends by entities established in China is subject to limitations. Regulations in
China currently permit payment of dividends only out of accumulated profits as determined in accordance with accounting standards and
regulations in China. In accordance with the Article 210, 214 of the Company Law of the PRC (Revised in 2023), each of our PRC subsidiaries
is required to allocate 10 of their profits to their statutory common reserve when they distribute their after-tax profits for the current
year. A company shall no longer be required to make allocations to their statutory common reserve once the aggregate amount of such reserve
exceeds 50 of their registered capital. The statutory common reserve fund of a company may only be used to cover the losses of the company,
expand the business and production of the company or be converted into additional capital. As a result, our PRC subsidiaries are restricted
in their ability to transfer a portion of their net assets to us in the form of dividends. In addition, if any of our PRC subsidiaries
incurs debt on its own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict such subsidiary s ability to pay dividends
or make other distributions to us. Any limitations on the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to transfer funds to us could materially and
adversely limit our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our business, pay dividends and otherwise
fund and conduct our business. 

32 

You may be subject to PRC income tax on
dividends from us or on any gain realized on the transfer of our ordinary shares. 

Under the PRC EIT Law, subject to any applicable
tax treaty or similar arrangement between the PRC and your jurisdiction of residence that provides for a different income tax arrangement,
PRC withholding tax at the rate of 10.0 is normally applicable to dividends from PRC sources payable to investors that are non-PRC resident
enterprises, which do not have an establishment or place of business in China, or which have such establishment or place of business if
the relevant income is not effectively connected with the establishment or place of business. Any gain realized on the transfer of shares
by such investors is subject to 10.0 PRC income tax if such gain is regarded as income derived from sources within China unless a treaty
or similar arrangement otherwise provides. Under the Individual Income Tax Law of the PRC and its implementation rules, dividends from
sources within China paid to foreign individual investors who are not PRC residents are generally subject to a PRC withholding tax at
a rate of 20 and gains from PRC sources realized by such investors on the transfer of shares are generally subject to 20 PRC income
tax, in each case, subject to any reduction or exemption set forth in applicable tax treaties and PRC laws. 

There is a risk that we will be treated by the
PRC tax authorities as a PRC tax resident enterprise. In that case, any dividends we pay to our shareholders may be regarded as income
derived from sources within China and we may be required to withhold a 10.0 PRC withholding tax for the dividends we pay to our investors
who are non-PRC corporate shareholders, or a 20.0 withholding tax for the dividends we pay to our investors who are non-PRC individual
shareholders, including the holders of our Shares. In addition, our non-PRC shareholders may be subject to PRC tax on gains realized on
the sale or other disposition of our ordinary shares, if such income is treated as sourced from within China. It is unclear whether our
non-PRC shareholders would be able to claim the benefits of any tax treaties between their tax residence and China in the event that we
are considered as a PRC resident enterprise. If PRC income tax is imposed on gains realized through the transfer of our ordinary shares
or on dividends paid to our non-resident investors, should there be a determination in the future to pay dividends, the value of your
investment in our ordinary shares may be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, our shareholders whose jurisdictions of residence
have tax treaties or arrangements with China may not qualify for benefits under such tax treaties or arrangements. 

We may be unable to complete a business
combination transaction efficiently or on favorable terms due to complicated merger and acquisition regulations and certain other PRC
regulations. 

On August 8, 2006, six PRC regulatory authorities,
including Ministry of Commerce, the State Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the SAT, the Administration for Industry and
Commerce, the CSRC and SAFE, jointly issued the M A Rules, which became effective on September 8, 2006 and were amended in June 2009.
The M A Rules, governing the approval process by which a PRC company may participate in an acquisition of assets or equity interests
by foreign investors, requires the PRC parties to make a series of applications and supplemental applications to the government agencies,
depending on the structure of the transaction. In some instances, the application process may require presentation of economic data concerning
a transaction, including appraisals of the target business and evaluations of the acquirer, which are designed to allow the government
to assess the transaction. Accordingly, due to the M A Rules, our ability to engage in business combination transactions has become
significantly more complicated, time-consuming and expensive, and we may not be able to negotiate a transaction that is acceptable to
our shareholders or sufficiently protective of their interests in a transaction. 

The M A Rules allow PRC government agencies
to assess the economic terms of a business combination transaction. Parties to a business combination transaction may have to submit to
Ministry of Commerce and other relevant government agencies an appraisal report, an evaluation report and the acquisition agreement, all
of which form part of the application for approval, depending on the structure of the transaction. The M A Rules also prohibit a transaction
at an acquisition price obviously lower than the appraised value of the business or assets in China and in certain transaction structures,
require that consideration must be paid within defined periods, generally not in excess of a year. In addition, the M A Rules also
limit our ability to negotiate various terms of the acquisition, including aspects of the initial consideration, contingent consideration,
holdback provisions, indemnification provisions and provisions relating to the assumption and allocation of assets and liabilities. Transaction
structures involving trusts, nominees and similar entities are prohibited. Therefore, such regulations may impede our ability to negotiate
and complete a business combination transaction on legal and/or financial terms that satisfy our investors and protect our shareholders 
economic interests.

Fluctuations in exchange rates could have
a material adverse impact on our results of operations and the value of your investment. 

The conversion of Renminbi into foreign currencies,
including U.S. dollars, is based on rates set by the People s Bank of China. The Renminbi has fluctuated against the U.S. dollar,
at times significantly and unpredictably. The value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is
affected by, among other things, changes in political and economic conditions in China and by China s foreign exchange policies,
among other things. We cannot assure you that Renminbi will not appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the U.S. dollar
in the future. It is difficult to predict how market forces or PRC or U.S. government policy may impact the exchange rate between the
Renminbi and the U.S. dollar in the future. 

Significant fluctuation of the Renminbi may have
a material adverse effect on your investment. For example, to the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars into Renminbi for our operations,
appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar would have an adverse effect on the Renminbi amount we would receive from the conversion.
Conversely, if we decide to convert our Renminbi into U.S. dollars for the purpose of making payments for dividends on our ordinary shares
or for other business purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Renminbi would have a negative effect on the U.S. dollar amount
available to us. 

Very limited hedging options are available in
China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. As of the date of this Report, we have not entered into any material hedging
transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. While we may decide to enter into hedging transactions
in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these hedges may be limited and we may not be able to adequately hedge our exposure
or at all. In addition, our currency exchange losses may be magnified by PRC exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to
convert Renminbi into foreign currency. 

Governmental control of currency conversion
may limit our ability to utilize our revenues effectively and affect the value of your investment. 

The PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility
of the Renminbi into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of China. We receive a significant portion
of our revenues in Renminbi. Under our current corporate structure, our British Virgin Islands holding company may rely on dividend payments
from our PRC subsidiaries to fund any cash and financing requirements we may have. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments
of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions,
can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval of SAFE, by complying with certain procedural requirements. Specifically, under
the existing exchange restrictions, without prior approval of SAFE, cash generated from the operations of our PRC subsidiaries in China
may be used to pay dividends to our Company. However, approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is required
where Renminbi is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of loans
denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, we need to obtain SAFE approval to use cash generated from the operations of our PRC subsidiaries
to pay off their respective debt in a currency other than Renminbi owed to entities outside China, or to make other capital expenditure
payments outside China in a currency other than Renminbi. If such approval is withheld or the PRC government imposes other restrictions
on the convertibility of Renminbi into foreign currencies, we may not be able to utilize our revenues effectively, and as a result, our
business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected, and the value of our ordinary shares may decrease. 

34 

U.S. regulatory bodies may be limited in
their ability to conduct investigations or inspections of our operations in China. 

The SEC, the U.S. Department of Justice and other
U.S. authorities may also have difficulties in bringing and enforcing actions against us or our directors or executive officers in the
PRC. The SEC has stated that there are significant legal and other obstacles to obtaining information needed for investigations or litigation
in China. China has recently adopted a revised securities law that became effective on March 1, 2020, Article 177 of which provides, among
other things, that no overseas securities regulator is allowed to directly conduct an investigation or evidence collection activities
within the territory of the PRC. Accordingly, without governmental approval in China, no entity or individual in China may provide documents
and information relating to securities business activities to overseas regulators when it is under direct investigation or evidence discovery
conducted by overseas regulators, which could present significant legal and other obstacles to obtaining information needed for investigations
and litigation conducted outside of China. 

Our ordinary shares may be delisted and
prohibited from being traded under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act if the PCAOB is unable to inspect our auditors. The delisting
and the cessation of trading of our ordinary shares, or the treat of their being delisted and prohibited from being traded, may materially
and adversely affect the value of your investment. Additionally, any inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections deprives our investors
with the benefits of such inspections. 

Pursuant to the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable
Act, as amended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2023, if the SEC determines that we have filed audit reports issued by a registered
public accounting firm that has not been subject to inspections by the PCAOB for two consecutive years, the SEC will prohibit our Ordinary
Shares from being traded on a national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter trading market in the United States. 

Our auditor, Enrome LLP, as an auditor of companies
that are traded publicly in the United States and a firm registered with the PCAOB, is subject to laws in the United States pursuant to
which the PCAOB conducts regular inspections to assess its compliance with the applicable professional standards and was not identified
in PCAOB s determination report as a firm subject to the PCAOB s determination. Our current auditor, Enrome LLP, is headquartered
in the Republic of Singapore and subject to inspect by the PCAOB. 

If the PCAOB determines in the future that it
no longer has full access to inspect and investigate completely accounting firms in mainland China and Hong Kong and we use an accounting
firm headquartered in one of these jurisdictions to issue an audit report on our financial statements filed with the SEC, we would be
identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer following the filing of the annual report on Form 20-F for the relevant fiscal year. In accordance
with the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, our securities would be prohibited from being traded on a national securities exchange
or in the over-the-counter trading market in the United States if we are identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer for two consecutive
years in the future. A prohibition of being able to trade in the United States would substantially impair or completely hinder your ability
to sell or purchase our Ordinary Shares when you wish to do so, and the risk and uncertainty associated with delisting would have a negative
impact on the price of our Ordinary Shares or render them worthless. Also, such a prohibition would significantly affect our ability to
raise capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and
prospects. 

Additionally, we cannot assure you whether the
national securities exchange we are listed on or regulatory authorities would apply additional and more stringent criteria to us after
considering the effectiveness of our auditor s audit procedures and quality control procedures, adequacy of personnel and training,
or sufficiency of resources, geographic reach, or experience as it relates to our audit. 

35 

Risks Related to Our Ordinary Shares 

Future sales of our ordinary shares, whether
by us or our shareholders, could cause the price of our ordinary shares to decline. 

If our existing shareholders sell, or indicate
an intent to sell, substantial amounts of our ordinary shares in the public market, the trading price of our ordinary shares could decline
significantly. Similarly, the perception in the public market that our shareholders might sell our ordinary shares could also depress
the market price of our shares. A decline in the price of our ordinary shares might impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance
of additional ordinary shares or other equity securities. In addition, the issuance and sale by us of additional ordinary shares, or securities
convertible into or exercisable for our ordinary shares, or the perception that we will issue such securities, could reduce the trading
price for our ordinary shares as well as make future sales of equity securities by us less attractive or not feasible. The sale of ordinary
shares issued upon the exercise of our outstanding warrants could further dilute the holdings of our then existing shareholders. 

We do not know whether a market for the
ordinary shares will be sustained or what the trading price of the ordinary shares will be and as a result it may be difficult for you
to sell your ordinary shares. 

Although our ordinary shares trade on Nasdaq,
an active trading market for the ordinary shares may not be sustained. It may be difficult for you to sell your ordinary shares without
depressing the market price for the ordinary shares. As a result of these and other factors, you may not be able to sell your ordinary
shares. Further, an inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling ordinary shares, or may impair our ability
to enter into strategic partnerships or acquire companies or products by using our ordinary shares as consideration. 

Securities analysts may not cover our ordinary
shares and this may have a negative impact on the market price of our ordinary shares. 

The trading market for our ordinary shares will
depend, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any
control over independent analysts (provided that we have engaged various non-independent analysts). We do not currently have and may never
obtain research coverage by independent securities and industry analysts. If no independent securities or industry analysts commence coverage
of us, the trading price for our ordinary shares would be negatively impacted. If we obtain independent securities or industry analyst
coverage and if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our ordinary shares, changes their opinion of our shares or publishes
inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our ordinary shares would likely decline. If one or more of these
analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our ordinary shares could decrease and we could
lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause the price and trading volume of our ordinary shares to decline. 

Because we do not expect to pay dividends
in the foreseeable future, you must rely on the price appreciation of our ordinary shares for a return on your investment. 

We currently intend to retain most, if not all,
of our available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, we do not expect to pay
any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Therefore, you should not rely on an investment in our ordinary shares as a source for any
future dividend income. 

Our board of directors has complete discretion
as to whether to distribute dividends, subject to certain requirements of British Virgin Islands law. In addition, our shareholders may
by ordinary resolution declare a dividend, but no dividend may exceed the amount recommended by our board of directors. Under British
Virgin Islands law, a British Virgin Islands company may pay a dividend out of either profit or share premium account, provided that in
no circumstances may a dividend be paid if this would result in the company being unable to pay its debts as they fall due in the ordinary
course of business. Even if our board of directors decides to declare and pay dividends, the timing, amount and form of future dividends,
if any, will depend on, among other things, our future results of operations and cash flow, our capital requirements and surplus, the
amount of distributions, if any, received by us from our subsidiaries, our financial condition, contractual restrictions, and other factors
deemed relevant by our board of directors. Accordingly, the return on your investment in our ordinary shares will likely depend entirely
upon any future price appreciation of our ordinary shares. There is no guarantee that our ordinary shares will appreciate in value or
even maintain the price at which you purchased the ordinary shares. You may not realize a return on your investment in our ordinary shares
and you may even lose your entire investment in our ordinary shares. 

36 

Techniques employed by short sellers may
drive down the market price of our ordinary shares. 

Short selling is the practice of selling securities
that the seller does not own but rather has borrowed from a third party with the intention of buying identical securities back at a later
date to return to the lender. The short seller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed
securities and the purchase of the replacement shares, as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received in the
sale. As it is in the short seller s interest for the price of the security to decline, many short sellers publish, or arrange for
the publication of, negative opinions regarding the relevant issuer and its business prospects in order to create negative market momentum
and generate profits for themselves after selling a security short. These short attacks have, in the past, led to selling of shares in
the market. 

Other public companies listed in the United States
that have substantial operations in China have been the subject of short selling. Much of the scrutiny and negative publicity has centered
on allegations of a lack of effective internal control over financial reporting resulting in financial and accounting irregularities and
mistakes, inadequate corporate governance policies or a lack of adherence thereto and, in many cases, allegations of fraud. As a result,
many of these companies are now conducting internal and external investigations into the allegations and, in the interim, are subject
to shareholder lawsuits and/or SEC enforcement actions. 

We may in the future be the subject of unfavorable
allegations made by short sellers. Any such allegations may be followed by periods of instability in the market price of our ordinary
shares and negative publicity. If and when we become the subject of any unfavorable allegations, whether such allegations are proven to
be true or untrue, we could be required to expend a significant amount of resources to investigate such allegations and/or defend ourselves.
While we would strongly defend against any such short seller attacks, we may be constrained in the manner in which we can proceed against
the relevant short seller by principles of freedom of speech, applicable federal or state law or issues of commercial confidentiality.
Such a situation could be costly and time- consuming and could distract our management from growing our business. Even if such allegations
are ultimately proven to be groundless, allegations against us could severely impact our business operations and shareholder s equity,
and the value of any investment in our ordinary shares could be greatly reduced or rendered worthless.
