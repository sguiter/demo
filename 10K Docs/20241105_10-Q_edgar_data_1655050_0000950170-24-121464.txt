 shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share. Shares of common stock of the Company began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol BCSF on November 15, 2018. The Company s primary focus is capitalizing on opportunities within the Advisor s Senior Direct Lending Strategy, which seeks to provide risk-adjusted returns and current income to its stockholders by investing primarily in middle-market companies with between million and million in annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"). The Company focuses on senior investments with a first or second lien on collateral and strong structures and documentation intended to protect the lender. The Company generally seeks to retain voting control in respect of the loans or particular classes of securities in which the Company invests through maintaining affirmative voting positions or negotiating consent rights that allow the Company to retain a blocking position. The Company may also invest in mezzanine debt and other junior securities and in secondary purchases of assets or portfolios, as described below. Investments are likely to include, among other things, (i) senior first lien, stretch senior, senior second lien, unitranche, (ii) mezzanine debt and other junior investments and (iii) secondary purchases of assets or portfolios that primarily consist of middle-market corporate debt. The Company may also invest, from time to time, in equity securities, distressed debt, debtor-in-possession loans, structured products, structurally subordinate loans, investments with deferred interest features, zero-coupon securities and defaulted securities. Our operations comprise only a single reportable segment.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded million and million, respectively, of dividend income, of which related to PIK dividends. If at any point the Company believes PIK is not expected to be realized, the investment generating PIK will be placed on non-accrual status. Certain structuring fees and amendment fees are recorded as other income when earned. Administrative agent fees received by the Company are recorded as other income when the services are rendered. Expenses are recorded on an accrual basis. 
 loans from issuers on non-accrual. As of December 31, 2023, there were loans from issuers on non-accrual. 
 million and million , respectively for U.S. federal excise tax. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded an expense of million and million , respectively for U.S. federal excise tax. The specific tax characteristics of the Company s distributions will be reported to stockholders after the end of the calendar year. All distributions will be subject to available funds, and no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to declare such distributions in future periods. The Company distributes net capital gains (i.e., net long-term capital gains in excess of net short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually out of the assets legally available for such distributions. However, the Company may decide in the future to retain such capital gains for investment, incur a corporate-level tax on such capital gains, and elect to treat such capital gains as deemed distributions to stockholders.

provision for income taxes is required in the consolidated financial statements. For income tax purposes, distributions made to stockholders are reported as ordinary income, capital gains, non-taxable return of capital, or a combination thereof. The tax character of distributions paid to stockholders through September 30, 2024 may include return of capital, however, the exact amount cannot be determined at this point. The final determination of the tax character of distributions will not be made until the Company files our tax return for the tax year ending December 31, 2024. The character of income and gains that the Company distributes is determined in accordance with income tax regulations that may differ from US GAAP. BCSF CFSH, LLC, BCSF CFS, LLC, and BCC Middle Market CLO 2019 1, LLC are disregarded entities for tax purposes and are consolidated with the tax return of the Company. The Company evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing its consolidated financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are reversed and recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. All penalties and interest associated with income taxes, if any, are included in income tax expense. Conclusions regarding tax positions are subject to review and may be adjusted at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going analyses of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. Management has analyzed the Company s tax positions, and has concluded that liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions on returns to be filed by the Company for all open tax years should be recorded. The Company identifies its major tax jurisdiction as the United States, and the Company is not aware of any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will change materially in the next 12 months. As of September 30, 2024 , the tax years that remain subject to examination are from 2020 forward.

In future periods, the Company may sell certain of its investments or a participating interest in certain of its investments to ISLP. Since inception, the Company has sold million of its investments to ISLP. The sale of the investments met the criteria set forth in ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing for treatment as a sale. The Company has determined that ISLP is an investment company under ASC 946; however, in accordance with such guidance, the Company will generally not consolidate its investment in a company other than a wholly or substantially owned investment company subsidiary, which is an extension of the operations of the Company, or a controlled operating company whose business consists of providing services to the Company. The Company does not consolidate its investments in ISLP as it is not a substantially wholly owned investment company subsidiary. In addition, the Company does not control ISLP due to the allocation of voting rights among ISLP members. The Company measures the fair value of ISLP in accordance with ASC 820, using the net asset value (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient. The Company and Pantheon each appointed two members to ISLP s four-person Member Designees Committee.

On February 4, 2022, ISLP entered into the second amended and restated credit agreement, which among other things formed an additional tranche ISLP Credit Facility Tranche B and collectively with ISLP Credit Facility Tranche A, the ISLP Credit Facilities with an initial financing limit of million on May 31, 2022, and million on August 31, 2022, bringing the total facility size to million. On June 30, 2023, ISLP entered into the third amendment and restated credit agreement, which among other things, replaced LIBOR with Term SOFR and consolidated Tranche A and Tranche B, with a size of million. On September 11, 2023, ISLP entered into the fourth amended and restated credit agreement, which among other things, extended the maturity to February 9, 2027, modified concentration limitations and changed the interest rate to SOFR (or an alternative risk-free interest rate index) plus basis points. As of September 30, 2024, the ISLP Credit Facilities had million of outstanding debt under the credit facility. As of December 31, 2023 the ISLP Credit Facilities had million of outstanding debt under the credit facility.

Amberstone s initial capital commitments to SLP are million, with each party expected to maintain their pro rata proportionate share for each capital contribution. SLP will seek to invest primarily in senior secured first lien loans of U.S. borrowers. Through these capital contributions, SLP acquired of the membership equity interests of the Company s 2018 1 portfolio 2018 1 ).

The Company used the income approach and market approach to determine the fair value of certain Level 3 assets as of September 30, 2024. The significant unobservable inputs used in the income approach are the comparative yield and discount rate. The comparative yield and discount rate are used to discount the estimated future cash flows expected to be received from the underlying investment. An increase/decrease in the comparative yield or discount rate would result in a decrease/increase, respectively, in the fair value. The significant unobservable inputs used in the market approach are the comparable company multiple and the recovery rate. The multiple is used to estimate the enterprise value of the underlying investment. An increase/decrease in the multiple would result in an increase/decrease, respectively, in the fair value. The recovery rate represents the extent to which proceeds can be recovered. An increase/decrease in the recovery rate would result in an increase/decrease, respectively, in the fair value.

per quarter) of the average value of the Company s gross assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents, but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts) at the end of each of the most recently completed calendar quarters. Such amount shall be appropriately adjusted (based on the actual number of days elapsed relative to the total number of days in such calendar quarter) for any share issuance or repurchases by the Company during a calendar quarter. The Base Management Fee for any partial quarter will be appropriately prorated. Effective February 1, 2019, the base management fee has been revised to a tiered management fee structure so that the base management fee of per quarter) of the average value of the Company s gross assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents, but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts) will continue to apply to assets held at an asset coverage ratio down to , but a lower base management fee of per quarter) of the average value of the Company s gross assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents, but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts) will apply to any amount of assets attributable to leverage decreasing the Company s asset coverage ratio below . For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, management fees were million and million , respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, management fees were million and million , respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, million and million , respectively, remained payable related to the base management fee accrued in base management fee payable on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. Incentive Fee The incentive fee consists of two parts that are determined independently of each other such that component may be payable even if the other is not. The first part, the Incentive Fee based on income is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears as detailed below. The second part, the capital gains incentive fee, is determined and payable in arrears as detailed below. Incentive Fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Company receives from portfolio companies but excluding fees for providing managerial assistance) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus operating expenses for the quarter (including the Base Management Fee, any expenses payable under the Administration Agreement, and any interest expense and dividends paid on any outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature such as market discount, original issue discount OID ), debt instruments with PIK interest, preferred stock with PIK dividends and zero-coupon securities, accrued income that the Company has not yet received in cash. Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized or unrealized capital gains or losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Because of the structure of the incentive fee, it is possible that the Company may pay an incentive fee in a quarter where the Company incurs a loss. For example, if the Company receives pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the Hurdle rate for a quarter, the Company will pay the applicable incentive fee even if the Company has incurred a loss in that quarter due to realized and unrealized capital losses.

preceding calendar quarters (the Trailing Quarters ). This calculation is referred to as the Lookback. Pre-incentive fee net investment income in respect of the relevant Trailing Quarters is compared to a Hurdle Amount equal to the product of (i) the hurdle rate of per quarter annualized) and (ii) the sum of our net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness and before taking into account any incentive fees payable during the period) at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising the relevant Trailing Quarters. The Hurdle Amount will be calculated after making appropriate adjustments to our NAV at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter for our subscriptions (which shall include all issuances by us of shares of our Common Stock, including issuances pursuant to the Company s dividend reinvestment plan) and distributions during the applicable calendar quarter. The quarterly incentive fee based on income is calculated, subject to the Incentive Fee Cap (as defined below), based on the amount by which (A) aggregate pre-incentive fee net investment income in respect of the relevant Trailing Quarters exceeds (B) the Hurdle Amount for such Trailing Quarters. The amount of the excess of (A) over (B) described in this paragraph for such Trailing Quarters is referred to as the Excess Income Amount. The incentive fee based on income that is paid to the Advisor in respect of a particular calendar quarter will equal the Excess Income Amount less the aggregate incentive fees based on income that were paid to the Advisor in the preceding calendar quarters (or portion thereof) comprising the relevant Trailing Quarters. The incentive fee based on income for each calendar quarter is determined as follows: (i) incentive fee based on income is payable to the Advisor for any calendar quarter for which there is no Excess Income Amount; 

 (ii) of the aggregate pre-incentive fee net investment income in respect of the Trailing Quarters with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the Hurdle Amount, but is less than or equal to an amount, which the Company refers to as the Catch-up Amount, determined as the sum of multiplied by our NAV at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising the relevant Trailing Quarters; and 

 (iii) of the aggregate pre-incentive fee net investment income in respect of the Trailing Quarters that exceeds the Catch-up Amount. 

 Incentive Fee Cap The incentive fee based on income is subject to a cap (the Incentive Fee Cap ). The Incentive Fee Cap in respect of any calendar quarter is an amount equal to of the Cumulative Net Return (as defined below) during the relevant Trailing Quarters less the aggregate incentive fees based on income that were paid to the Advisor in the preceding eleven calendar quarters (or portion thereof) comprising the relevant Trailing Quarters. Cumulative Net Return during the relevant Trailing Quarters means (x) the pre-incentive fee net investment income in respect of the relevant Trailing Quarters less (y) any Net Capital Loss, if any, in respect of the relevant Trailing Quarters. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap is zero or a negative value, the Company will pay incentive fee based on income to the Advisor in respect of that quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter is a positive value but is less than the incentive fee based on income that is payable to the Advisor for such quarter calculated as described above, the Company will pay an incentive fee based on income to the Advisor equal to the Incentive Fee Cap in respect of such quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter is equal to or greater than the incentive fee based on income that is payable to the Advisor for such quarter calculated as described above, the Company will pay an incentive fee based on income to the Advisor equal to the incentive fee calculated as described above for such quarter without regard to the Incentive Fee Cap. Net Capital Loss in respect of a particular period means the difference, if positive, between (i) aggregate capital losses, whether realized or unrealized, in respect of such period and (ii) aggregate capital gains, whether realized or unrealized, in respect of such period. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred million and million , respectively, of income incentive fees (before waivers), which are included in incentive fees on the consolidated statements of operations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred million and million , respectively, of income incentive fees (before waivers), which are included in incentive fees on the consolidated statements of operations.

million and million , respectively, related to the income incentive fee accrued in incentive fee payable on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. The Amended Advisory Agreement approved by Stockholders on February 1, 2019 incorporates (i) a lookback provision and (ii) a cap on quarterly income incentive fee payments based on net realized or unrealized capital loss, if any, during the applicable lookback period. Annual Incentive Fee Based on Capital Gains The second part of the incentive fee is a capital gains incentive fee that will be determined and payable in arrears in cash as of the end of each fiscal year (or upon termination of the Amended Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), and equals to of our realized capital gains as of the end of the fiscal year. In determining the capital gains incentive fee payable to the Advisor, the Company calculates the cumulative aggregate realized capital gains and cumulative aggregate realized capital losses since our inception, and the aggregate unrealized capital depreciation as of the date of the calculation, as applicable, with respect to each of the investments in our portfolio. For this purpose, cumulative aggregate realized capital gains, if any, equals the sum of the differences between the net sales price of each investment, when sold, and the cost of such investment. Cumulative aggregate realized capital losses equals the sum of the amounts by which the net sales price of each investment, when sold, is less than the cost of such investment. Aggregate unrealized capital depreciation equals the sum of the difference, if negative, between the valuation of each investment as of the applicable calculation date and the cost of such investment. At the end of the applicable year, the amount of capital gains that serves as the basis for our calculation of the capital gains incentive fee equals the cumulative aggregate realized capital gains less cumulative aggregate realized capital losses, less aggregate unrealized capital depreciation, with respect to our portfolio of investments. If this number is positive at the end of such year, then the capital gains incentive fee for such year will equal to of such amount, less the aggregate amount of any capital gains incentive fees paid in respect of our portfolio in all prior years. There was capital gains incentive fee payable to the Advisor under the Amended Advisory Agreement as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. US GAAP requires that the incentive fee accrual consider the cumulative aggregate unrealized capital appreciation of investments or other financial instruments in the calculation, as an incentive fee would be payable if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the fee actually payable under the Amended Advisory Agreement GAAP Incentive Fee ). There can be no assurance that such unrealized appreciation will be realized in the future. Accordingly, such fee, as calculated and accrued, would not necessarily be payable under the Amended Advisory Agreement, and may never be paid based upon the computation of incentive fees in subsequent period. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company accrued million and million of incentive fees related to the GAAP Incentive Fee, which is included in incentive fees on the consolidated statements of operations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company accrued million and million of incentive fees related to the GAAP Incentive Fee, which is included in incentive fees on the consolidated statements of operations. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was million and million related to the GAAP Incentive Fee accrued in incentive fee payable on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities, respectively.

Pursuant to the Administration Agreement, the Administrator has agreed to oversee our public reporting requirements and tax reporting and monitor our expenses and the performance of professional services rendered to us by others.

Resource Sharing Agreement The Company s investment activities are managed by the Advisor, an investment adviser that is registered with the SEC under the Advisers Act.

Through the Resource Sharing Agreement, the Advisor intends to capitalize on the significant deal origination, credit underwriting, due diligence, investment structuring, execution, portfolio management and monitoring experience of Bain Capital Credit s investment professionals. There can be no assurance that Bain Capital Credit will perform its obligations under the Resource Sharing Agreement. The Resource Sharing Agreement may be terminated by either party on notice, which if terminated may have a material adverse consequence on the Company s operations. Co-investments The Company will invest alongside our affiliates, subject to compliance with applicable regulations and our allocation procedures. Certain types of negotiated co-investments will be made only in accordance with the terms of the exemptive order the Company received from the SEC initially on August 23, 2016, as amended on March 23, 2018 and December 22, 2021 (the Order ).

In certain situations where co-investment with one or more funds managed by the Advisor or its affiliates is not covered by the Order, the personnel of the Advisor or its affiliates will need to decide which funds will proceed with the investment. Such personnel will make these determinations based on policies and procedures, which are designed to reasonably ensure that investment opportunities are allocated fairly and equitably among affiliated funds over time and in a manner that is consistent with applicable laws, rules and regulations.

 Overview 
 Bain Capital Specialty Finance, Inc. (the Company , we , our and us is an externally managed specialty finance company focused on lending to middle market companies. We have elected to be regulated as a business development company (a BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the 1940 Act ). We are managed by the Advisor, a subsidiary of Bain Capital Credit, LP Bain Capital Credit ). Our Advisor is registered as an investment adviser with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the Advisers Act ). Our Advisor also provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate (in such capacity, our Administrator ). Since we commenced operations on October 13, 2016 through September 30, 2024, we have invested approximately 8,132.9 million in aggregate principal amount of debt and equity investments prior to any subsequent exits or repayments. We seek to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation through direct originations of secured debt, including first lien, first lien/last-out, unitranche and second lien debt, investments in strategic joint ventures, equity investments and, to a lesser extent, corporate bonds. 
 On November 19, 2018, we closed our initial public offering (the IPO issuing 7,500,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of 20.25 per share. Shares of common stock of the Company began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol BCSF on November 15, 2018. 
 Our primary focus is capitalizing on opportunities within our Senior Direct Lending strategy, which seeks to provide risk-adjusted returns and current income to our stockholders by investing primarily in middle-market companies with between 10.0 million and 150.0 million in annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA ). However, we may, from time to time, invest in larger or smaller companies. We generally seek to retain effective voting control in respect of the loans or particular classes of securities in which we invest through maintaining affirmative voting positions or negotiating consent rights that allow us to retain a blocking position. We focus on senior investments with a first or second lien on collateral and strong structures and documentation intended to protect the lender. We may also invest in mezzanine debt and other junior securities, including common and preferred equity, on an opportunistic basis, and in secondary purchases of assets or portfolios but such investments are not the principal focus of our investment strategy. In addition, we may invest, from time to time, in distressed debt, debtor-in-possession loans, structured products, structurally subordinate loans, investments with deferred interest features, zero-coupon securities and defaulted securities. 
 We generate revenues primarily through receipt of interest income from the investments we hold. In addition, we generate income from various loan origination and other fees, dividends on direct equity investments and capital gains on the sales of investments. The companies in which we invest use our capital for a variety of reasons, including to support organic growth, to fund changes of control, to fund acquisitions, to make capital investments and for refinancing and recapitalizations. 
 Investments 
 Our level of investment activity may vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the level of investment and capital expenditures of such companies, the general economic environment, the amount of capital we have available to us and the competitive environment for the type of investments we make. 
 As a BDC, we may not acquire any assets other than qualifying assets specified in the 1940 Act, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70 of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). Qualifying assets include investments in eligible portfolio companies. Pursuant to rules adopted by the SEC, eligible portfolio companies include certain companies that do not have any securities listed on a national securities exchange and public companies whose securities are listed on a national securities exchange but whose market capitalization is less than 250 million. 
 114 

As a BDC, we may also invest up to 30 of our portfolio opportunistically in non-qualifying portfolio investments, such as investments in non-U.S. companies. 
 Revenues 
 We primarily generate revenue in the form of interest income on debt investments and distributions on equity investments and, to a lesser extent, capital gains, if any, on equity securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies. Some of our investments may provide for deferred interest payments or payment-in-kind PIK interest. The principal amount of the debt investments and any accrued but unpaid interest generally becomes due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, structuring or diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts into or against income over the life of the loan. We record contractual prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income. 
 Our debt investment portfolio consists of primarily floating rate loans. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 90.8 and 93.8 , respectively, of our debt investments, based on fair value, bore interest at floating rates, which may be subject to interest rate floors. Variable-rate investments subject to a floor generally reset periodically to the applicable floor, only if the floor exceeds the index. Trends in base interest rates, such as SOFR, may affect our net investment income over the long term. In addition, our results may vary from period to period depending on the interest rates of new investments made during the period compared to investments that were sold or repaid during the period; these results reflect the characteristics of the particular portfolio companies that we invested in or exited during the period and not necessarily any trends in our business or macroeconomic trends. 
 Dividend income on preferred equity investments is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity investments is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies and on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. 
 Expenses 
 Our primary operating expenses include the payment of fees to our Advisor under the Amended Advisory Agreement, our allocable portion of overhead expenses under the administration agreement (the Administration Agreement and other operating costs, including those described below. The Base Management Fee and Incentive Fee compensate our Advisor for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, closing and monitoring our investments. We bear all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including: 
 our operational and organizational costs; 

the costs of any public offerings of our common stock and other securities, including registration and listing fees; 

costs of calculating our net asset value (including the cost and expenses of any third-party valuation services); 

fees and expenses payable to third parties relating to evaluating, making and disposing of investments, including our Advisor s or its affiliates travel expenses, research costs and out-of-pocket fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence and reviews of prospective investments, monitoring our investments and, if necessary, enforcing our rights; 

interest payable on debt and other borrowing costs, if any, incurred to finance our investments; 

costs of effecting sales and repurchases of our common stock and other securities; 

distributions on our common stock; 

transfer agent and custody fees and expenses; 

the allocated costs incurred by the Administrator in providing managerial assistance to those portfolio companies that request it; 

other expenses incurred by the Administrator or us in connection with administering our business, including payments made to third-party providers of goods or services; 

brokerage fees and commissions; 

115 

federal and state registration fees; 

U.S. federal, state and local taxes; 

Independent Director fees and expenses; 

costs associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act and applicable U.S. federal and state securities laws; 

costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to our stockholders, including printing costs; 

costs of holding stockholder meetings; 

our fidelity bond; 

directors and officers errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums; 

litigation, indemnification and other non-recurring or extraordinary expenses; 

direct costs and expenses of administration and operation, including printing, mailing, long distance telephone, staff, audit, compliance, tax and legal costs; 

fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts; 

dues, fees and charges of any trade association of which we are a member; and 

all other expenses reasonably incurred by us or the Administrator in connection with administering our business. 

To the extent that expenses to be borne by us are paid by the Administrator, we will generally reimburse the Administrator for such expenses. To the extent the Administrator outsources any of its functions, the Company will pay the fees associated with such functions on a direct basis without profit to the Administrator. We will also reimburse the Administrator for its costs and expenses and our allocable portion of overhead incurred by it in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including certain rent and compensation paid to or compensatory distributions received by our officers (including our Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer) and any of their respective staff who provide services to us, operations staff who provide services to us, internal audit staff, if any, to the extent internal audit performs a role in our Sarbanes-Oxley internal control assessment and fees paid to third-party providers for goods or services. Our allocable portion of overhead will be determined by the Administrator, which expects to use various methodologies such as allocation based on the percentage of time certain individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to our business and affairs, and will be subject to oversight by our Board. We incurred expenses related to the Administrator of 0.7 million and 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which is included in other general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. We incurred expenses related to the Administrator of 1.8 million and 0.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which is included in other general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. The sub-administrator is paid its compensation for performing its sub-administrative services under the sub-administration agreement. We incurred expenses related to the sub-administrator of 0.1 million and 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which is included in other general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. The sub-administrator is paid its compensation for performing its sub-administrative services under the sub-administration agreement. We incurred expenses related to the sub-administrator of 0.4 million and 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which is included in other general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. The Administrator will not be reimbursed to the extent that such reimbursements would cause any distributions to our stockholders to constitute a return of capital. All of the foregoing expenses are ultimately borne by our stockholders. 
 Leverage 
 We may borrow money from time to time. However, our ability to incur indebtedness (including by issuing preferred stock), is limited by applicable regulations such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, must equal at least 150 . In determining whether to borrow money, we will analyze the maturity, covenant package and rate structure of the proposed borrowings as well as the risks of such borrowings compared to our investment outlook. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s asset coverage was 187.8 .

Investment Decision Process 
 The Advisor s investment process can be broken into five processes: (1) Sourcing and Idea Generation, (2) Investment Diligence Recommendation, (3) Credit Committee Approval, (4) Portfolio Construction and (5) Portfolio Risk Management. 
 Sourcing and Idea Generation 
 The investment decision-making process begins with sourcing ideas. Bain Capital Credit s Private Credit Group interacts with a broad and deep set of global sourcing contacts, enabling the group to generate a large set of middle-market investment opportunities. Further enhancing the sourcing capability of the core Private Credit Group are Bain Capital Credit s industry groups, Trading Desk, and the Bain Capital Special Situations team. The team has extensive contacts with private equity firms. Relationships with banks, a variety of advisors and intermediaries and a handful of unique independent sponsors compose the remainder of the relationships. Through these sourcing efforts the Private Credit Group has built a sustainable deal funnel, which has generated hundreds of opportunities to review annually. 
 Investment Diligence Recommendation 
 Our Advisor utilizes Bain Capital Credit s bottom-up approach to investing, and it starts with the due diligence. The Private Credit Group works with the close support of Bain Capital Credit s industry groups on performing due diligence. This process typically begins with a detailed review of the offering memorandum as well as Bain Capital Credit s own independent diligence efforts, including in-house materials and expertise, third-party independent research and interviews, and hands-on field checks where appropriate. For deals that progress beyond an initial stage, the team will schedule one or more meetings with company management, facilities visits and also meetings with the sponsor in order to ask more detailed questions and to better understand the sponsor s view of the business and plans for it going forward. The team s diligence work is summarized in investment memorandums and accompanying credit packs. Work product also includes full models and covenant analysis. The approval process itself is iterative, involving multiple levels of discussion and approval. 
 Credit Committee Approval 
 Given Bain Capital Credit s broad and diverse range of investment strategies, we tailor our investment decision-making process by strategy to provide a robust and comprehensive discussion of both individual investments and the applicable portfolio(s) under consideration. We believe that this flexible approach provides a rigorous investment decision-making process that allows us to be nimble across a variety of market environments while still maintaining high credit underwriting standards. 
 Our investments require approval from at least the Private Credit Investment Committee, which includes three Partners in the Private Credit Group as standing members: Michael Ewald, Mike Boyle, and Carolyn Hastings. Ad hoc members may also be included in the Private Credit Investment Committee for certain types of investments. 
 Portfolio Construction 
 Portfolio construction is largely the responsibility of the portfolio managers. The portfolio managers will construct the portfolio using a set of approved investments. While the decision to buy generally requires approval from at least the Private Credit Investment Committee, the decision to sell securities is at the sole discretion of the portfolio managers. For middle-market holdings, the path to exit an investment is discussed at credit committee meetings, including restructurings, acquisitions and sale to strategic buyers. Since most middle-market investments are illiquid, exits are driven primarily by a sale of the portfolio company or a refinancing of the portfolio company s debt. 
 Portfolio Risk Management 
 Our Advisor utilizes Bain Capital Credit s Private Credit Group for the daily monitoring of its respective credits after an investment has been made. Our Advisor believes that the ongoing monitoring of financial performance and market developments of portfolio investments is critical to successful investment management. Accordingly, our Advisor is actively involved in an on-going portfolio review process and attends board meetings. To the extent a portfolio investment is not meeting our Advisor s expectations, our Advisor takes corrective action when it deems appropriate, which may include raising interest rates, gaining a more influential role on its board, taking warrants and, where appropriate, restructuring the balance sheet to take control of the company. Our Advisor will utilize the Bain Capital Credit Risk and Oversight Committee. The Risk and Oversight Committee is responsible for monitoring and reviewing risk management, including portfolio risk, counterparty risk and firm-wide risk issues. In addition to the methods noted above, there are a number of proprietary methods and tools used through all levels of Bain Capital Credit to manage portfolio risk.

Loans or debt securities are placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected. Accrued interest generally is reversed when a loan or debt security is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans or debt securities may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment. Non-accrual loans and debt securities are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in management s judgment, are likely to remain current. We may make exceptions to this treatment if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. As of September 30, 2024, there were nine loans from five issuers placed on non-accrual in the Company s portfolio. As of December 31, 2023, there were five loans from three issuers placed on non-accrual in the Company s portfolio.

Our Advisor monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. It monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if they are meeting their respective business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action for each company. The Advisor has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include the following: 
 assessment of success in adhering to the portfolio company s business plan and compliance with covenants; 

periodic or regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; 

comparisons to our other portfolio companies in the industry, if any; 

attendance at and participation in board meetings or presentations by portfolio companies; and 

review of monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections of portfolio companies. 

Our Advisor rates the investments in our portfolio at least quarterly and it is possible that the rating of a portfolio investment may be reduced or increased over time. For investments rated 3 or 4, our Advisor enhances its level of scrutiny over the monitoring of such portfolio company. Our internal performance ratings do not constitute any rating of investments by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or represent or reflect any third-party assessment of any of our investments. 
 An investment is rated 1 if, in the opinion of our Advisor, it is performing above underwriting expectations, and the business trends and risk factors are generally favorable, which may include the performance of the portfolio company or the likelihood of a potential exit. 

An investment is rated 2 if, in the opinion of our Advisor, it is performing as expected at the time of our underwriting and there are generally no concerns about the portfolio company s performance or ability to meet covenant requirements, interest payments or principal amortization, if applicable. All new investments or acquired investments in new portfolio companies are initially given a rating of 2. 

An investment is rated 3 if, in the opinion of our Advisor, the investment is performing below underwriting expectations and there may be concerns about the portfolio company s performance or trends in the industry, including as a result of factors such as declining performance, non-compliance with debt covenants or delinquency in loan payments (but generally not more than 180 days past due). 

121 

An investment is rated 4 if, in the opinion of our Advisor, the investment is performing materially below underwriting expectations. For debt investments, most of or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. Investments rated 4 are not anticipated to be repaid in full, if applicable, and there is significant risk that we may realize a substantial loss on our investment.

Net Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets Resulting from Operations 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the net increase in net assets resulting from operations was 33.1 million and 33.9 million, respectively. Based on the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our per share net increase in net assets resulting from operations was 0.51 and 0.52, respectively. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the increase in net assets resulting from operations was 97.3 million and 92.3 million, respectively. Based on the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our per share net increase in net assets resulting from operations was 1.51 and 1.43, respectively. 
 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our liquidity and capital resources are derived primarily from proceeds from equity issuances, advances from our credit facilities, 2019 1 Debt, March 2026 Notes, October 2026 Notes, the Sumitomo Credit Facility and cash flows from operations. The primary uses of our cash are for (1) investments in portfolio companies and other investments and to comply with certain portfolio diversification requirements; (2) the cost of operations (including payments to the Advisor under the Investment Advisory and Administration Agreements); (3) debt service, repayment, and other financing costs; and (4) cash distributions to the holders of our common shares. 
 We intend to continue to generate cash primarily from cash flows from operations, future borrowings and future offerings of securities. We may from time to time raise additional equity or debt capital through registered offerings, enter into additional debt facilities, or increase the size of existing facilities or issue debt securities. Any such incurrence or issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. We are required to meet an asset coverage ratio, defined under the 1940 Act as the ratio of our total assets (less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities) to our outstanding senior securities, of at least 150 after each issuance of senior securities. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our asset coverage ratio was 187.8 and 189.9 , respectively. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 59.8 million and 112.5 million in cash, foreign cash, restricted cash and cash equivalents, respectively. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had approximately 501.3 million of availability on our Sumitomo Credit Facility, subject to existing terms and regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2023 we had approximately 343.3 million of availability on our Sumitomo Credit Facility subject to existing terms and regulatory requirements. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash, foreign cash, restricted cash, and cash equivalents decreased by 52.7 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used 7.1) million in cash for operating activities. The increase in cash used in operating activities was primarily related to purchases of investments of 1,097.8 million, which was offset by proceeds from principal payments and sales of investments of 1,001.5 million and a net increase in assets resulting from operations of 97.3 million. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used 45.7 million for financing activities, primarily on repayments of our Sumitomo Credit Facility of 522.3 million and distributions paid during the period of 85.2 million, partially offset by borrowings of 565.0 million. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash, foreign cash, restricted cash, and cash equivalents decreased by 20.3 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we provided 70.6 million in cash for operating activities. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily related to cash generated from earnings of 92.3 million outpacing net increase in investments of 14.6 million. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we used 89.3 million for financing activities, primarily due to borrowings and repayments on our Sumitomo Credit Facility and paying our quarterly dividend to shareholders. 
 
 Equity 
 On November 19, 2018, we closed our IPO issuing 7,500,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of 20.25 per share. Shares of common stock of the Company began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol BCSF on November 15, 2018. The offering generated net proceeds, after expenses, of 145.4 million. All outstanding capital commitments from the Company s Private Offering were cancelled as of the completion of the IPO. 
 128 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not issue shares of our common stock to investors who have opted into our dividend reinvestment plan. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we did not issue shares of our common stock to investors who have opted into our dividend reinvestment plan. 
 On May 7, 2019, the Company s Board authorized the Company to repurchase up to 50 million of its outstanding common stock in accordance with safe harbor rules under the Exchange Act. Any such repurchases will depend upon market conditions and there is no guarantee that the Company will repurchase any particular number of shares or any shares at all. As of September 30, 2024, there have been no repurchases of common stock.

Distributions to common stockholders are recorded on the record date. To the extent that we have income available, we intend to distribute quarterly distributions to our stockholders. Our quarterly distributions, if any, will be determined by the Board. Any distributions to our stockholders will be declared out of assets legally available for distribution. 
 129 

We have elected to be treated, and intend to operate in a manner so as to continuously qualify, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2016. To qualify for and maintain RIC tax treatment, among other things, we must distribute dividends to our stockholders in respect of each taxable year of an amount generally at least equal to 90 of the sum of our net ordinary income and net short-term capital gains in excess of our net long-term capital losses. In order to avoid the imposition of certain excise taxes imposed on RICs, we must distribute dividends to our stockholders in respect of each calendar year of an amount at least equal to the sum of: (1) 98 of our net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for such calendar year; (2) 98.2 of our capital gains in excess of capital losses, adjusted for certain ordinary losses, generally for the one-year period ending on October 31 of such calendar year; and (3) the sum of any net ordinary income plus capital gains net income for preceding years that were not distributed during such years and on which we paid no federal income tax. 
 We intend to distribute net capital gains (i.e., net long-term capital gains in excess of net short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually out of the assets legally available for such distributions. However, we may decide in the future to retain all or a portion of our net capital gains for investment, incur a corporate-level tax on such capital gains, and elect to treat such capital gains as deemed distributions to our stockholders. 
 We have adopted a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for the reinvestment of cash dividends and distributions. Prior to the IPO, stockholders who opted in to our dividend reinvestment plan had their cash dividends and distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, rather than receiving cash dividends and distributions. Subsequent to the IPO, stockholders who do not opt out of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash dividends and distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, rather than receiving cash dividends and distributions. Stockholders could elect to opt in or opt out of our dividend reinvestment plan in their subscription agreements, through the private offering. The elections of stockholders prior to the IPO shall remain effective after the IPO. 
 The U.S. federal income tax characterization of distributions declared and paid for the fiscal year will be determined at fiscal year-end based upon our investment company taxable income for the full fiscal year and distributions paid during the full year. 
 Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We may become a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of our business to fund investments and to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. These instruments may include commitments to extend credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized on the statements of assets and liabilities. 
 Related Party Transactions 
 We have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the Amended Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement. 
 In addition to the aforementioned agreements, we, our Advisor and Bain Capital Credit have been granted exemptive relief from the SEC to permit greater flexibility to negotiate the terms of co-investments if the Board determines that it would be advantageous for us to co-invest with other Bain Capital Credit Clients in a manner consistent with our investment objectives, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent Bain Capital Credit Clients funds, accounts and investment vehicles managed by Bain Capital Credit may afford us additional investment opportunities and an ability to achieve greater diversification. Accordingly, our exemptive order permits us to invest with Bain Capital Credit Clients in the same portfolio companies under circumstances in which such investments would otherwise not be permitted by the 1940 Act. Our exemptive relief permitting co-investment transactions generally applies only if our Independent Directors and Directors who have no financial interest in such transaction review and approve in advance each co-investment transaction. The exemptive relief imposes other conditions with which we must comply to engage in co-investment transactions.

Significant Accounting Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies 
 Basis of Presentation 
 The Company s unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP. The Company s unaudited consolidated financial statements and related financial information have been prepared pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10 Q and Articles 1, 6, 10 and 12 of Regulation S-X. These consolidated financial statements reflect adjustments that in the opinion of the Company are necessary for the fair statement of the financial position and results of operations for the periods presented herein and are not necessarily indicative of the full fiscal year. We have determined we meet the definition of an investment company and follow the accounting and reporting guidance in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 946 Financial Services Investment Companies ASC 946 ). Our financial currency is U.S. dollars and these consolidated financial statements have been prepared in that currency. 
 Use of Estimates 
 The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and decreases in net assets from operations during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences could be material. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 We record our investment transactions on a trade date basis. We record realized gains and losses based on the specific identification method. We record interest income, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount, on an accrual basis. Discount and premium to par value on investments acquired are accreted and amortized, respectively, into interest income over the life of the respective investment using the effective interest method. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized and amortized into or against interest income using the effective interest method or straight-line method, as applicable. We record any prepayment premiums, unamortized upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts received upon prepayment of a loan or debt security as interest income. 
 Dividend income on preferred equity investments is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity investments is recorded on the record date for such distributions in the case of private portfolio companies, and on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. Distributions received from a limited liability company or limited partnership investment are evaluated to determine if the distribution should be recorded as dividend income or a return of capital. 
 Certain investments may have contractual PIK interest or dividends. PIK represents accrued interest or accumulated dividends that are added to the loan principal of the investment on the respective interest or dividend payment dates rather than being paid in cash and generally becomes due at maturity or upon being called by the issuer. We record PIK as interest or dividend income, as applicable. If at any point we believe PIK may not be realized, we place the investment generating PIK on non-accrual status. 
 Certain structuring fees and amendment fees are recorded as other income when earned. We record administrative agent fees received as other income when the services are rendered. 
 Valuation of Portfolio Investments 
 The Advisor shall value the investments owned by the Company, subject at all times to the oversight of the Board. The Advisor shall follow its own written valuation policies and procedures as approved by the Board when determining valuations. A short summary of the Advisor s valuation policies is below. 
 131 

Investments for which market quotations are readily available are typically valued at such market quotations. Pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, the Board designates the Advisor as Valuation Designee to perform fair value determinations for the Company for investments that do not have readily available market quotations. Market quotations are obtained from an independent pricing service, where available. If a price cannot be obtained from an independent pricing service or if the independent pricing service is not deemed to be current with the market, certain investments held by the Company will be valued on the basis of prices provided by principal market makers. Generally, investments marked in this manner will be marked at the mean of the bid and ask of the independent broker quotes obtained. To validate market quotations, the Company utilizes a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and number of quotations. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available will be valued at a price that reflects such security s fair value. 
 With respect to unquoted portfolio investments, the Company will value each investment considering, among other measures, discounted cash flow models, comparable company multiple models, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public, and other factors. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, the Company will use the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate and/or assist us in our valuation. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments, and the differences could be material. 
 With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, in particular, illiquid/hard to value assets, the Advisor will typically undertake a multi-step valuation process, which includes among other things, the below: 
 The Company s quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of the Advisor responsible for the portfolio investment; 

Preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with the Company s senior management and the Advisor; 

Generally investments that constitute a material portion of the Company s portfolio are periodically reviewed by an independent valuation firm; and 

The Board and Audit Committee provide oversight with respect to the valuation process, including requesting such materials as they deem appropriate. 

In following this approach, the types of factors that are taken into account in the fair value pricing of investments include, as relevant, but are not limited to: comparison to publicly traded securities, including factors such as yield, maturity and measures of credit quality; the enterprise value of a portfolio company; the nature and realizable value of any collateral; the portfolio company s ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flows; and the markets in which the portfolio company does business. In cases where an independent valuation firm provides fair valuations for investments, the independent valuation firm provides a fair valuation report, a description of the methodology used to determine the fair value and their analysis and calculations to support their concluded ranges. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 We have entered into the Amended Advisory Agreement with our Advisor (which supersedes the Prior Investment Advisory Agreement dated November 14, 2018 we had previously entered into). Our Advisor has agreed to serve as our investment adviser in accordance with the terms of the Amended Advisory Agreement. Under the Amended Advisory Agreement, we have agreed to pay an annual base management fee as well as an incentive fee based on our investment performance. 
 On November 28, 2018, our Board, including a majority of our Independent Directors, approved the Amended Advisory Agreement. On February 1, 2019 the Company s stockholders approved the Amended Advisory Agreement. Pursuant to this Agreement, effective February 1, 2019, the base management fee of 1.5 (0.375 per quarter) of the average value of the Company s gross assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents, but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts) will continue to apply to assets held at an asset coverage ratio of 200 , but a lower base management fee of 1.0 (0.25 per quarter) of the average value of the Company s gross assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents, but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts) will apply to any amount of assets attributable to leverage decreasing the Company s asset coverage ratio below 200 . The Amended Advisory Agreement incorporates (i) a three-year lookback provision and (ii) a cap on quarterly income incentive fee payments based on net realized or unrealized capital loss, if any, during the applicable three-year lookback period. 
 We have entered into an Administration Agreement with the Administrator pursuant to which the Administrator will furnish us with administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. We reimburse the Administrator for its costs and expenses and our allocable portion of overhead incurred by it in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, 
 132 

including certain compensation paid to or compensatory distributions received by our officers (including our Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer) and any of their respective staff who provide services to us, operations staff who provide services to us, and internal audit staff, if any, to the extent internal audit performs a role in our Sarbanes-Oxley internal control assessment. 
 If any of our contractual obligations discussed above are terminated, our costs may increase under any new agreements that we enter into as replacements. We would also likely incur expenses in locating alternative parties to provide the services we expect to receive under our Amended Advisory Agreement and Administration Agreement. 
 The following table shows the contractual maturities of our debt obligations as of September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands):

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. We will generally invest in illiquid loans and securities including debt and equity securities of middle-market companies. Because we expect that there will not be a readily available market for many of the investments in our portfolio, we expect to value many of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the Board using a documented valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments, and the differences could be material. There have been no material quantitative changes in reported market risk exposures in comparison to the information reported in the prior period. 
 Assuming that the statement of financial condition as of September 30, 2024 were to remain constant and that we took no actions to alter our existing interest rate sensitivity, the following table shows the annualized impact of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates (dollars in thousands):

From time to time, we may make investments that are denominated in a foreign currency. These investments are translated into U.S. dollars at the balance sheet date, exposing us to movements in foreign exchange rates. We may employ hedging techniques to minimize these risks, but we cannot assure you that such strategies will be effective or without risk to us. We may seek to utilize instruments such as, but not limited to, forward contracts to seek to hedge against fluctuations in the relative values of our portfolio positions from changes in currency exchange rates.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of September 30, 2024 (the end of the period covered by this report), our management has carried out an evaluation, under the supervision of and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a 15 and 15d 15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our current disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a 15(f) and 15d 15(f) under the Exchange Act, that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, is any material legal proceeding threatened against us.
