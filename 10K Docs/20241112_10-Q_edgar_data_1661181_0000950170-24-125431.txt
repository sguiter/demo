At such time, the Company determined that certain other modules within the ERP system and other internal-use software had no future use, and accordingly the Company recorded a write down of of costs related to this internal-use software. During the second quarter of 2024, the Company decided to pursue the potential sale of a purchased building, located on the Company s Canton, Massachusetts campus, on which it had previously paused construction work. The Company identified this change in expectation regarding the use of the building as an impairment indicator. The Company determined the asset group to be comprised of the building and associated construction, and performed the impairment assessment at the asset group level. The Company determined the impairment charge by comparing the fair value of the asset group to its book value and recorded an impairment charge of related to the building and associated unfinished construction work, allocated to each asset class within the asset group based on its relative carrying value. See Note 14, Fair Value Measurements . During the second quarter of 2024, the Company determined that the factors above constituted an impairment trigger relating to its remaining company-wide asset group. The Company performed a recoverability test in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment . The estimated undiscounted cash flows directly attributable to the asset group exceeded its carrying value, and accordingly the Company did not record any impairment related to this asset group. The Company did t record any impairment relating to its long-lived asset groups during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

The anti-dilutive potential common stock equivalents of for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share attributable to common stockholders because those stock options to purchase common stock and restricted stock units had an anti-dilutive impact due to the assumed proceeds per share using the treasury stock method being greater than the average fair value of the Company s common shares for such period. The anti-dilutive potential common stock equivalents of for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders because those options to purchase common stock and unvested restricted stock units had an anti-dilutive impact as the Company reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders for such period. The anti-dilutive potential common stock equivalents of for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share attributable to common stockholders because those stock options to purchase common stock and restricted stock units had an anti-dilutive impact due to the assumed proceeds per share using the treasury stock method being greater than the average fair value of the Company s common shares for those periods.

 and can be renewed for up to five additional terms. The Company recorded and in prepaid and other current assets and other assets for the payment of the upfront licensing fee and the VIA option payment, respectively, each of which is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the arrangement beginning at the time of payment and ending on December 31, 2026. In December 2023, the Company recorded in prepaid and other current assets, other assets, and accrued expenses and other current liabilities for the milestone payment, as the Company determined it is probable of owing such payment to Vivex. Royalties The Company entered into a license agreement with a university for certain patent rights related to the development, use, and production of one of its advanced wound care products. Under this agreement, the Company incurred a royalty based on a percentage of net product sales, for the use of these patents until the patents expired, which was in November 2006. In October 2017, the Company entered into a license agreement with a third party. Under the license agreement, the Company is required to pay royalties based on a percentage of net sales of the licensed product that occur, after December 31, 2017, through the expiration of the underlying patent in October 2026, subject to minimum royalty payment provisions. The Company recorded total royalty expense of , , , and during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, within selling, general and administrative expenses on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Legal Matters In conducting its activities, the Company, from time to time, is subject to various claims and also has claims against others. In management s opinion, the ultimate resolution of such claims would not have a material effect on the financial position, operating results or cash flows of the Company. The Company accrues for these claims when amounts due are probable and estimable.

The net proceeds will be used to fund strategic growth initiatives including, but not limited to, operating and commercial activities, clinical development programs, working capital, capital expenditures, debt repayment and for general corporate purposes. In addition, approximately of the net proceeds will be used to fund the repurchase of an aggregate of shares of Class A common stock from certain existing stockholders of the Company, including certain of its directors and their affiliates, at a price per share equal to , which represents the 10-day trailing volume weighted average price of the Common Stock as of market close on November 11, 2024, pursuant to stock repurchase agreements entered into on November 12, 2024 between the Company and such stockholders (Stock Repurchase Agreements and each stock repurchase thereunder, a Repurchase). Pursuant to the Certificate of Designations of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (Certificate of Designation), each share of Convertible Preferred Stock is initially convertible into shares of Common Stock, subject to adjustment as provided therein. The Convertible Preferred Stock ranks senior to shares of Class A common stock with respect to payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. The Convertible Preferred Stock will initially have a liquidation preference of per share; provided that the liquidation preference upon a change of control on or before November 12, 2026 will be increased to be no less than per share. Holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock will be entitled to a regular dividend at the rate of per annum, compounding and payable quarterly in kind or in cash, at the Company s election, subject to the ownership limitations described below. Any accrued but unpaid dividends will become part of the liquidation preference of such share, as set forth in the Certificate of Designation. Until the Company receives stockholder approval, as contemplated by Nasdaq listing rules, with respect to the issuance of shares of Class A common stock upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock in excess of the limitations imposed by such rules, holders of Convertible Preferred Stock (Preferred Stock Holders) the Investors cannot convert the Convertible Preferred Stock into a number of shares of Common Stock in excess of shares, which represents of the outstanding shares of Common Stock at the time of signing the Subscription Agreement, or to the extent such conversion will result in a Preferred Stock Holder beneficially owning greater than of the Company s then-outstanding shares. If, prior to receipt of the stockholder approval, a Preferred Stock Holder elects to convert any Convertible Preferred Stock that would result in the issuance, when aggregated with the number of shares previously issued upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock, of more than of the outstanding shares of Common Stock at the time of signing the Subscription Agreement, then the Company will, in lieu of issuing shares of Common Stock, pay the Preferred Stock Holder a cash amount equal to the product of the number of shares of Common Stock that could not be issued due to such limitation and the 10-day trailing volume weighted average price of the Common Stock as of the trading day immediately prior to the conversion date (Cash-in-Lieu Payments), which Cash-in-Lieu Payments shall be paid no later than November 4, 2026, together with accrued interest of per annum, to the extent an earlier cash payment is prohibited pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement. The Convertible Preferred Stock is subject to certain transfer restrictions, and contain terms regarding anti-dilution, liquidation preference, and preemptive rights, and its holders will vote together with the Class A common stock on an as-converted basis. The Convertible Preferred Stock is redeemable at the option of the Preferred Stock Holders at any time after November 12, 2031, and is convertible at the option of the Company after the second anniversary of issuance if the closing price of the Company s common stock equals or exceeds of the conversion price for twenty trading days out of a period of thirty consecutive trading days. The Preferred Stock Holders are entitled to elect one member and one observer to the Company s Board of Directors, subject to the terms of the Convertible Preferred Stock. Repurchase Agreements On November 12, 2024, the Company entered into the Stock Repurchase Agreements with certain existing stockholders, including certain directors and affiliates of the Company, pursuant to which the Company will repurchase shares of Common Stock from the Selling Stockholders for a purchase price of per share.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes included in this Form 10-Q and the financial statements and accompanying notes thereto and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC, on February 29, 2024. Please refer to our cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements on page 3 of this Form 10-Q, which is incorporated herein by this reference. 
 Overview 
 We are a leading regenerative medicine company focused on the development, manufacture, and commercialization of solutions for the Advanced Wound Care and Surgical Sports Medicine markets. Our products have been shown through clinical and scientific studies to support and in some cases accelerate tissue healing and improve patient outcomes. We are advancing the standard of care in each phase of the healing process through multiple breakthroughs in tissue engineering and cell therapy. Our solutions address large and growing markets driven by aging demographics and increases in comorbidities such as diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular and peripheral vascular disease. We offer our differentiated products and in-house customer support to a wide range of health care customers including hospitals, wound care centers, government facilities, ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) and physician offices. Our mission is to provide integrated healing solutions that substantially improve medical outcomes and the lives of patients while lowering the overall cost of care. 
 We offer a comprehensive portfolio of products in the markets we serve that address patient needs across the continuum of care. We have and intend to continue to generate data from clinical trials, real-world outcomes and health economics research that validate the clinical efficacy and value proposition offered by our products. Several of our existing and pipeline products in our portfolio have PMA approval, or 510(k) clearance from the FDA. Given the extensive time and cost required to conduct clinical trials and receive FDA approvals, we believe that our data and regulatory approvals provide us with a strong competitive advantage. Our product development expertise and multiple technology platforms provide a robust product pipeline, which we believe will drive future growth. 
 In the Advanced Wound Care market, we focus on the development and commercialization of advanced wound care products for the treatment of chronic and acute wounds in various treatment settings. We have a comprehensive portfolio of regenerative medicine products, capable of supporting patients from early in the wound healing process through wound closure regardless of wound type. Our Advanced Wound Care products include Apligraf for the treatment of venous leg ulcers (VLUs) and diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs); Dermagraft for the treatment of DFUs (manufacturing and distribution currently suspended pending transition to a new manufacturing facility or engagement of a third-party manufacturer); PuraPly AM and PuraPly XT as antimicrobial barriers and native, cross-linked extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffolds for a broad variety of wound types; and Affinity, Novachor, NuShield, and CYGNUS placental allografts to address a variety of wound sizes and types as a protective barrier and ECM scaffold. We have a highly trained and specialized direct wound care sales force paired with comprehensive customer support services. 
 In the Surgical Sports Medicine market, we are leveraging our broad regenerative medicine capabilities to address chronic and acute surgical wounds and tendon and ligament injuries. Our Sports Medicine products include NuShield for surgical applications in targeted soft tissue repairs; and Affinity, Novachor, PuraPly AM, PuraPly MZ, and PuraPly SX for management of open wounds in the surgical setting. We currently sell these products through independent agencies and our direct sales force. 
 In May 2024, we announced that our Phase 3 randomized control trial (RCT) evaluating the safety and efficacy of ReNu, a cryopreserved amniotic suspension allograft (ASA) for the management of symptoms associated with knee osteoarthritis (OA), achieved its primary endpoint upon the analysis of positive top line data. Specifically, as previously announced, the first Phase 3 RCT achieved the pre-defined requirements - statistically significant reduction in knee pain (p=0.0177) and statistically significant maintenance of function (p 
 We completed a Type-B meeting with the FDA on July 25, 2024. The FDA typically requires two well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to support regulatory approval. The FDA indicated that a second Phase 3 study would be needed to support biologics license application (BLA) submission. We recently completed enrollment in the second Phase 3 multi-center RCT evaluating the safety and efficacy of ReNu with 594 patients, outperforming enrollment expectations. We expect to receive the outcome of the pre-specified interim analysis of the first 50 of the required patients by the end of November, and are still on track to submit the BLA by the end of 2025. 
 Dermagraft 
 As previously disclosed, we have not manufactured or sold Dermagraft since 2022. During this time, we have successfully leveraged our highly differentiated broad cellular and tissue-based products (CTPs), including Apligraf and Affinity, as substitutes for Dermagraft. Accordingly, the suspension of Dermagraft sales has not had a material impact on our net revenue. We currently plan to transition our Dermagraft manufacturing to a new facility, which we expect will result in substantial long-term cost savings. If we do 
 20 

Table of Contents 

not realize these expected substantial long-term cost savings or if recommencement of manufacture and sale of Dermagraft is significantly delayed, our net revenue and results of operations could be adversely impacted. 
 Local Coverage Determinations 
 In August 2023, three Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) issued local coverage determinations (LCDs) eliminating coverage for DFUs and VLUs for over 130 products, including five of our commercially marketed products. The LCDs were scheduled to take effect on September 17, 2023, and subsequently delayed to October 1, 2023. Given the potential adverse impact these LCDs could have on patients and on our business, we worked with our advisors to convince the MACs to withdraw the LCDs and incurred legal expenses and compensation expenses related to retention for impacted sales employees. On September 28, 2023, the three MACs withdrew the LCDs. Notwithstanding the ultimate withdrawal of the LCDs, we believe that some of our customers elected to purchase covered products from our competitors, reducing our revenue for the third and fourth quarters of the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 On April 25, 2024, seven MACs published proposed LCDs for skin substitute grafts/CTPs for the treatment of DFUs and VLUs in the Medicare population, that propose to cover three of our products, and to non-cover five of our commercially marketed product lines. We have engaged with the MACs, reiterated our support of the evidence-based approach reflected in the draft LCDs and requested that the final LCD include certain of our products for which we have provided clinical evidence, demonstrating their efficacy for the treatment of DFUs and VLUs, as covered products. There is no guarantee that the MACs will agree to cover these products in the final LCDs. 
 License And Manufacturing Agreement 
 In November 2023, we entered into a trademark license and manufacturing agreement with Vivex Biologics, Inc. (Vivex) to sell its CYGNUS Dual (Dual) and CYGNUS Matrix (Matrix) products, with the option to license the VIA Matrix (VIA) products. In March 2024, we exercised the option to license VIA, and accordingly in July 2024, entered into the first amendment to the trademark license and manufacturing agreement (together with the original agreement, the Vivex Agreement). 
 We paid an upfront licensing fee to Vivex to sell Dual and Matrix, and also agreed to pay a fixed milestone payment for Dual in the event that its average sales price (ASP) is published by certain government agencies for a specified period of time. We remitted the option payment for VIA in April 2024. Additionally, we are required to pay a low double-digit royalty on the Net Sales of Dual and VIA, and a high single-digit royalty on the Net Sales of Matrix, respectively, during the royalty term, as defined in the Vivex Agreement. The royalty term is commensurate with the initial term of the contract and will continue for each subsequent renewal period. The initial term of the agreement expires on December 31, 2026 and can be renewed for up to five additional one-year terms. 
 Components of Our Condensed Consolidated Results of Operations 
 In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. We believe the items discussed below provide insight into the factors that affect these key measures. 
 Revenue 
 We derive our net revenue from our portfolio of Advanced Wound Care and Surgical Sports Medicine products. We primarily sell our Advanced Wound Care products through direct sales representatives who manage and maintain the sales relationships with hospitals, wound care centers, government facilities, ASCs and physician offices. We primarily sell our Surgical Sports Medicine products through third party agencies. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 262 direct sales representatives and approximately 161 independent agencies. 
 We recognize revenue from sales of our Advanced Wound Care and Surgical Sports Medicine products when the customer obtains control of our product, which occurs at a point in time and may be upon procedure date, shipment, or delivery, based on the contractual terms of a contract. We record revenue net of a reserve for returns, discounts and Group Purchasing Organization (GPO) rebates, which represent a direct reduction to the revenue we recognize. 
 Several factors affect our reported revenue in any period, including product, payer and geographic sales mix, operational effectiveness, pricing realization, marketing and promotional efforts, the timing of orders and shipments, regulatory actions including healthcare reimbursement scenarios, competition and business acquisitions. 
 Cost of goods sold and gross profit 
 Cost of goods sold includes personnel costs, product testing costs, quality assurance costs, raw materials and product costs, manufacturing costs, and the costs associated with our manufacturing and warehouse facilities. The changes in our cost of goods sold correspond with the changes in sales units and are also affected by product mix. 
 21 

Table of Contents 

Gross profit is calculated as net revenue less cost of goods sold and generally increases as revenue increases. Our gross profit is affected by product and geographic sales mix, realized pricing of our products, the efficiency of our manufacturing operations, and the costs of materials used and fees charged by third-party manufacturers to produce our products. Regulatory actions, including healthcare reimbursement scenarios, which may require costly expenditures or result in pricing pressures, may decrease our gross profit. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses generally include personnel costs for sales, marketing, sales support, customer support, and general and administrative personnel, sales commissions, incentive compensation, insurance, professional fees, depreciation, amortization, bad debt expense, royalties, information systems costs, gain or loss on disposal of long-lived assets, and costs associated with our administrative facilities. We generally expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to continue to increase due to increased investments in market development and the geographic expansion of our sales forces as we drive for continued revenue growth. 
 Research and development expenses 
 Research and development expenses include expenses for clinical trials, personnel costs for our research and development personnel, expenses related to improvements in our manufacturing processes, enhancements to our currently available products, and additional investments in our product and platform development pipeline. We expense research and development costs as incurred. We generally expect that research and development expenses will increase as we continue to conduct clinical trials on new and existing products, move products through the regulatory pathway (e.g., seek biologics license application approval), add personnel to support product enhancements as well as to bring new products to market, and enhance our manufacturing process and procedures. 
 Impairment and write down expenses 
 Impairment of property and construction relates to the potential sale of one of our buildings located on our Canton, Massachusetts campus and consists of the building and associated unfinished construction costs. Write down of capitalized internal-use software costs consists of the development costs for certain modules of our ERP system that were determined to have no future value. 
 Other expense, net 
 Other expense, net consists primarily of interest expense, which is interest on our outstanding indebtedness, including amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs, net of interest income recognized. 
 Income taxes 
 We account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce net deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. 
 In determining whether a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is necessary, we analyze both positive and negative evidence related to the realization of deferred tax assets including projected future taxable income, recent financial results and estimates of future reversals of deferred tax assets and liabilities. We expect to realize the benefit of our federal and state deferred tax assets, and accordingly have not recorded a valuation allowance for these deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 We account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the condensed consolidated financial statements by applying a two-step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. First, the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination by the taxing authorities. If the tax position is deemed more-likely-than-not to be sustained, the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the condensed consolidated financial statements. The amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any resulting tax reserves, or unrecognized tax benefits, that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
 Our management uses financial measures that are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (non-GAAP), in addition to financial measures in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) to evaluate our operating results. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, our reported financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our operating performance and trends and make planning decisions. Our management believes Adjusted EBITDA helps identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the items that we exclude. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results, enhancing the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects, and allowing for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making.

 Gross profit increased by 5.6 million to 88.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 82.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Gross profit increased by 15.9 million to 270.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 254.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to a shift in product mix.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 7.6 million, or 12 , to 71.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 64.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in royalty expense of 4.8 million, an increase in travel-related expenses of 1.1 million, an increase in facilities and supplies expense of 1.1 million, and an increase in our allowance for expected credit losses of 0.6 million. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 12.3 million, or 6 , to 220.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 208.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in royalty expense of 14.0 million, an increase in our allowance for expected credit losses of 2.5 million, an increase in building and other facilities expenses of 3.8 million, and an increase in consulting expenses of 2.2 million; partially offset by a decrease of 8.1 million in salaries, restructuring, and other headcount-related expenses, and a decrease of 2.1 million in other marketing expenses.

Research and development expenses decreased by approximately 0.1 million, or 1 , to 10.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 10.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Research and development expenses increased by 6.1 million, or 19 , to 38.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 32.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Research and development expenses were generally consistent in the three months ended September 30, 2024 from the three months ended September 30, 2023, and the increase in research and development expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to expenses associated with clinical research and trials, primarily related to ReNu, and support of Biologics License Application (BLA) efforts. 
 Impairment and Write Down Expenses 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a 4.0 million write down of costs related to internal-use software and an 18.8 million impairment of a purchased building and associated unfinished construction work. There were no such costs recorded in the three months ended September 30, 2024, or in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Income tax expense decreased by 11.0 million, or approximately 246 , to a benefit of 6.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 from expense of 4.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Income tax expense decreased by 12.9 million, or approximately 194 , to a benefit of 6.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from expense of 6.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the income tax expense is primarily attributable to a lower estimated effective tax rate for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 due to our research and development tax credits, as well as a reduction in expected pre-tax income in 2024 compared to 2023. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had working capital of 161.2 million, which included 94.3 million in cash and cash equivalents. We also have 125.0 million available for future revolving borrowings under our Revolving Facility (see Note 10, Long-Term Debt Obligations to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). We expect that our cash on hand and other components of working capital as of September 30, 2024, availability under the 2021 Credit Agreement, proceeds received in connection with our offering of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value 0.0001 per share, which closed on November 12, 2024, plus net cash flows from product sales, will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditure requirements and debt service payments for at least 12 months beyond the filing date of this quarterly report. 
 Our primary uses of cash are working capital requirements, capital expenditure and debt service payments. Additionally, from time to time, we may use capital for acquisitions and other investing and financing activities. Working capital is used principally for our personnel as well as manufacturing costs related to the production of our products and research and development costs. Our working capital requirements vary from period to period depending on manufacturing volumes, the timing of shipments and the payment cycles of our customers and payers. Our capital expenditures consist primarily of building improvements, manufacturing equipment, and computer hardware and software. 
 To the extent additional funds are necessary to meet our long-term liquidity needs as we continue to execute on our business

strategy, we anticipate that they will be obtained through additional equity or debt financings, other strategic transactions or a combination of these potential sources of funds. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funds on terms acceptable to us, on a timely basis, or at all.

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we used 21.0 million of cash in investing activities consisting exclusively of capital expenditures.

This consisted of the principal payment on our term loan of 4.2 million, principal payments on finance lease obligations of 0.8 million, and net cash payments associated with our stock awards activities of 1.0 million. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in financing activities was 3.7 million.

 Indebtedness 
 2021 Credit Agreement 
 In August 2021, we and our subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement with SVB and several other lenders, which we refer to as the 2021 Credit Agreement. The 2021 Credit Agreement, as amended, provides for a term loan facility not to exceed 75.0 million (the Term Loan Facility) and a revolving credit facility not to exceed 125.0 million (the Revolving Facility). 
 Advances made under the 2021 Credit Agreement may be either SOFR Loans or ABR Loans, at our option. For SOFR Loans, the interest rate is a per annum interest rate equal to the Adjusted Term SOFR plus an Applicable Margin between 2.00 to 3.25 based on the Total Net Leverage Ratio. For ABR Loans, the interest rate is equal to (1) the highest of (a) the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate, (b) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50 and (c) the Adjusted Term SOFR rate plus 1.0 , plus (2) an Applicable Margin between 
 27 

Table of Contents 

1.00 to 2.25 based on the Total Net Leverage Ratio. On September 30, 2024, the applicable interest rate for outstanding borrowings is 7.56 . 
 The 2021 Credit Agreement requires us to make consecutive quarterly installment payments equal to the following: (a) from September 30, 2021 through and including June 30, 2022, 0.5 million; (b) from September 30, 2022 through and including June 30, 2023, 0.9 million; (c) from September 30, 2023 through and including June 30, 2025, 1.4 million and (d) from September 30, 2025 and the last day of each quarter thereafter until August 6, 2026 (the Term Loan Maturity Date), 1.9 million. The remaining principal balance of 50.6 million is also due on the Term Loan Maturity Date. We may prepay the Term Loan Facility. Once repaid, amounts borrowed under the Term Loan Facility may not be re-borrowed. 
 We must pay in arrears, on the first day of each quarter prior to August 6, 2026 (the Revolving Termination Date) and on the Revolving Termination Date, a fee for our non-use of available funds (the Commitment Fee). The Commitment Fee rate is between 0.25 to 0.45 based on the Total Net Leverage Ratio. We may elect to reduce or terminate the Revolving Facility in its entirety at any time by repaying all outstanding principal and unpaid accrued interest. 
 Under the 2021 Credit Agreement, we are required to comply with certain financial covenants including the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, tested quarterly. In addition, we are also required to make representations and warranties and comply with certain non-financial covenants that are customary in loan agreements of this type, including restrictions on the payment of dividends, repurchase of stock, incurrence of indebtedness, dispositions and acquisitions. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants under the 2021 Credit Agreement. We had outstanding borrowings of 62.3 million under our Term Loan Facility and no borrowings outstanding under our Revolving Facility with 125.0 million available for future revolving borrowings, respectively. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 
 Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and the disclosure at the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, as well as revenue and expenses recorded during the reporting periods. Management bases its estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which, in turn, could materially change our results from those reported. Management evaluates its estimates, assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis. Historically, our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results. However, if our assumptions change, we may need to revise our estimates, or take other corrective actions, either of which may also have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), liquidity and financial condition. See also our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, for information about these accounting policies as well as a description of our other significant accounting policies. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We did not have, during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC. 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 We have reviewed all recently issued standards as disclosed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to our market risk disclosures as set forth in Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms promulgated by the SEC. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 Based on that evaluation, our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective because, as disclosed in the Company s Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, we did not design and maintain effective controls over information technology general controls and proper segregation of duties to support the proper initiation and recording of transactions and the resulting impact on business process controls and applications that rely on such data. 
 Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in the SEC guidance on conducting such assessments as of the end of the period covered by this report. Management conducted the assessment based on certain criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013 (COSO framework). Although it has made progress in remediating the remaining material weakness, as a result of its assessment, management concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective based on the criteria of the COSO framework, and the continued existence of the material weakness described above. 
 Plans for Remediation of Material Weakness 
 Management has taken actions to remediate the deficiencies in its internal controls over financial reporting and implemented additional processes and controls designed to address the underlying causes associated with the above-mentioned material weakness. Management s internal control remediation efforts include the following: 
 During the second quarter of 2024, we completed the implementation of certain modules in a new company-wide enterprise resource planning (ERP) system to provide additional systematic controls and segregation of duties for our accounting processes. We have implemented additional controls to mitigate existing risks of proper segregation and change configurations. 

An outside firm will continue to assist management with performing control operating effectiveness testing throughout the year. 

We regularly reported the results of control testing to the key stakeholders across our organization, including our audit committee, on testing progress and defined corrective actions, and we monitored and reported on the results of control remediation. We have strengthened our internal policies, processes, and reviews through these actions. 

We have continued working on documenting and remediating weaknesses and structuring the Company s processes to meet Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) 404(b) requirements. 

We believe the appropriate controls have been implemented in remediating the remaining material weakness. Until the controls have been operating for a sufficient period of time during 2024 and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are executed consistently and operating effectively, the material weakness described above will continue to exist. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting other than those described above related to remediation efforts of the remaining material weakness. As the implementation of the remaining modules of the new ERP system continues, and management continues to test its aforementioned new controls throughout 2024, we will change our processes and procedures, which in turn, could result in changes to our internal control over financial reporting. As such changes occur, we will evaluate quarterly whether such changes materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are not a party to any material legal proceedings. From time to time, we may become involved in litigation or other legal proceedings relating to claims arising from the ordinary course of business. These matters may include intellectual property, employment and other general claims. With respect to our outstanding legal matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the outcome of such legal matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. 
 Item 1A. Ri sk Factors 
 Investing in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, includes a detailed discussion of our risk factors under the heading Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors . Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes from such risk factors during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. You should consider carefully the risk factors discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and all other information contained in or incorporated by reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q before making an investment decision. If any of the risks discussed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, or herein actually occur, they may materially harm our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows or growth prospects. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not yet identified or that we think are immaterial may also materially harm our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows or growth prospects and could result in a complete loss of your investment. 
 Seven MACs published new proposed LCDs, for skin substitute grafts/CTPs for the treatment of DFUs and VLUs in the Medicare population that list certain of our products as non-covered. If the final LCDs include this non-coverage determination, it could, at least in the near term, have a material adverse effect on utilization of these products, our business and our revenue. 
 On April 25, 2024, seven MACs (CGS, WPS, NGS, Palmetto, Novitas, First Coast Services, and Noridian) published new proposed LCDs for skin substitute grafts/CTPs for the treatment of DFUs and VLUs in the Medicare population. While our Affinity, Apligraf and Dermagraft products remain covered, the proposed LCDs classify our PuraPly, Novachor, TransCyte, NuShield, Dual, and Matrix products as non-covered. If the final LCDs do not include coverage for these products, it would present a significant amount of uncertainty, at least in the near term, regarding future revenue for these products. Although we have engaged with the MACs and provided clinical evidence for certain of these non-covered products demonstrating their efficacy for the treatment of DFUs and VLUs, there is no guarantee that the MACs will agree to cover these products in the final LCDs. If these products are not covered in the final LCDs, it could, at least in the near term, materially and adversely impact utilization of these products, our business and our revenue.

 (v)	If the Preferred Designation Right Condition is no longer satisfied and the Subscribers hold Conversion Shares representing at least five percent (5 of the then-outstanding shares of Common Stock (the Subscriber Designation Right Condition and together with the Preferred Designation Right Condition, the Designation Right Conditions ), if requested by the Subscribers, the Company shall grant substantially similar rights provided by this Section 8 to the Subscribers (the Subscriber Designation Right ).

 (e)	 Settlement upon Conversion . 
 
 (i)	 Generally . Subject to Section 9(e)(ii) , Section 9(h) , Section 9(i) and 
 - 32 - 

Section 13(b) , the consideration due upon settlement of the conversion of each share of Convertible Preferred Stock will consist of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the product of (A) the Conversion Rate in effect immediately before the Close of Business on the Conversion Date for such conversion; and (B) the quotient obtained by dividing (I) the sum of (x) the Liquidation Preference of such share of Convertible Preferred Stock immediately before the Close of Business on such Conversion Date and (y) an amount equal to accumulated and unpaid Regular Dividends on such share of Convertible Preferred Stock to, but excluding, such Conversion Date (but only to the extent such accumulated and unpaid Regular Dividends are not included in the Liquidation Preference referred to in the preceding clause (x) ), by (II) the Initial Liquidation Preference per share of Convertible Preferred Stock.

 (iii)	 Delivery of Conversion Consideration . The Company will pay or deliver, as applicable, the Conversion Consideration due upon conversion of any Convertible Preferred Stock on or before the number of Trading Days comprising the Standard Settlement Period after the Conversion Date for such conversion (the Share Delivery Date ). The Company understands that a delay in the delivery of the shares of Common Stock after the Share Delivery Date could result in economic loss to the Holder. As compensation to the Holder for such loss, if (i) the Company fails to deliver the number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder is entitled upon the Holder s conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock within the time period specified above and (ii) the Holder has not exercised its Buy-In rights as provided below with respect to such shares, the Company agrees to pay (as liquidated damages and not as a penalty) to the Holder for late issuance of the shares of Common Stock upon exercise of the Convertible Preferred Stock the proportionate amount of 100 per Trading Day (increasing to 200 per Trading Day after the third (3rd) Trading Day and increasing to 300 per Trading Day after the sixth (6th) Trading Day) after the Share Delivery Date for each 10,000 of shares of Common Stock for which the Convertible Preferred Stock is converted which are not timely delivered. For purposes of clarification, if the Company is obligated to make payments of liquidated damages pursuant to this Section 9(e)(iii) for late issuance of shares of Common Stock, then it shall not also be obligated to make Buy-In payments as described below with respect to those same shares of Common Stock. The Company shall pay any payments incurred under this Section 9(e)(iii) in immediately available funds upon demand. 
 (iv)	 Buy-In . In addition to any other rights available to the Holder, if the Company fails for any reason to effect delivery of the shares of Common Stock to the holder by the Share Delivery Date and if after such date the Holder is required by its broker to purchase (in an open market transaction or otherwise) or the Holder or its brokerage firm otherwise purchases, shares of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of the Common Stock which the holder anticipated receiving upon such exercise (a 
 - 33 - 

Buy-In ), then the Company shall (A) pay in cash to the Holder the amount, if any, by which (x) the Holder s total purchase price (including brokerage commissions, if any) for the shares of Common Stock so purchased, minus any amounts paid to the Holder by the Company as liquidated damages as described in Section 9(e)(iii) above, exceeds (y) the amount obtained by multiplying (1) the number of shares of Common Stock that the Company was required to deliver to the Holder in connection with the conversion at issue times (2) the price at which the sell order giving rise to such purchase obligation was executed, and (B) at the option of the Holder, either reinstate the portion of the Convertible Preferred Stock and equivalent number of shares of Common Stock for which such conversion was not honored (in which case such conversion shall be deemed rescinded) or deliver to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been issued had the Company timely complied with its exercise and delivery obligations hereunder. For example, if the Holder purchases Common Stock having a total purchase price of 11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted conversion of shares of Common Stock with an aggregate sale price giving rise to such purchase obligation of 10,000, under clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence the Company shall be required to pay the Holder 1,000, assuming no liquidated damages. The Holder shall provide the Company written notice indicating the amounts payable to the Holder in respect of the Buy-In and, upon request of the Company, evidence of the amount of such loss. Nothing herein shall limit a Holder s right to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Company s failure to timely deliver certificates representing shares of Common Stock upon exercise of Convertible Preferred Stock as required pursuant to the terms hereof. 
 (f)	 Conversion Rate Adjustments . 
 
 (i)	 Events Requiring an Adjustment to the Conversion Rate . The Conversion Rate will be adjusted from time to time as follows, in each case subject to Section 8 hereof: 
 (1)	 Stock Dividends, Splits and Combinations . If the Company issues solely shares of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution on all or substantially all shares of the Common Stock, or if the Company effects a stock split or a stock combination of the Common Stock (in each case excluding an issuance solely pursuant to a Common Stock Change Event, as to which Section 9(j) will apply), then the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula: 
 
 where: 
 CR 0 	=	the Conversion Rate in effect immediately before the Close of Business on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution, or immediately before the Close of Business on the effective date of such stock split or stock combination, as applicable; 
 - 34 - 

CR 1 	=	the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Close of Business on such Record Date or effective date, as applicable; 
 
 OS 0 	=	the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before the Close of Business on such Record Date or effective date, as applicable, without giving effect to such dividend, distribution, stock split or stock combination; and 
 
 OS 1 	=	the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such dividend, distribution, stock split or stock combination. 
 
 If any dividend, distribution, stock split or stock combination of the type described in this Section 9(f)(i)(1) is declared or announced, but not so paid or made, then the Conversion Rate will be readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors, or any Officer acting pursuant to authority conferred by the Board of Directors, determines not to pay such dividend or distribution or to effect such stock split or stock combination, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had such dividend, distribution, stock split or stock combination not been declared or announced. 
 
 (2)	 Degressive Issuances . If, at any time after the Initial Issue Date, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries issues or otherwise sells any shares of Common Stock, or any Equity-Linked Securities, in each case at an Effective Price per share of Common Stock that is less than the Conversion Price in effect (before giving effect to the adjustment required by this Section 9(f)(i)(2) as of the date of the issuance or sale of such shares or Equity-Linked Securities (such an issuance or sale, a Degressive Issuance ), then, effective as of the Close of Business on such date, the Conversion Rate will be increased to an amount equal to (x) the Initial Liquidation Preference per share of Convertible Preferred Stock, divided by (y) the Weighted Average Issuance Price; provided , however , that (A) the Conversion Rate will not be adjusted pursuant to this Section 9(f)(i)(2) as a result of an Exempt Issuance; (B) the issuance of shares of Common Stock pursuant to any such Equity-Linked Securities will not constitute an additional issuance or sale of shares of Common Stock for purposes of this Section 9(f)(i)(2) (it being understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that the issuance or sale of such Equity-Linked Securities, or any re-pricing or amendment thereof, will be subject to this Section 9(f)(i)(2) ); and (C) in no event will the Conversion Rate be decreased pursuant to this Section 9(f)(i)(2) . 
 For purposes of this Section 9(f)(i)(2) , any re-pricing or amendment of any Equity-Linked Securities (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Equity-Linked Securities existing as of the Initial Issue Date) will be deemed to be the issuance of additional Equity-Linked Securities, without affecting any prior adjustments theretofore made to the Conversion Rate. 
 
 - 35 - 

(ii)	 No Other Required Adjustments . Without limiting the operation of Sections 5(a)(ii)(1) and 9(e)(i) , the Company will not be required to adjust the Conversion Rate except pursuant to Section 9(f)(i) . 
 (iii)	 Determination of the Number of Outstanding Shares of Common Stock . For purposes of Section 9(f)(i) , the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any time will (1) include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock; and (2) exclude shares of Common Stock held in the Company s treasury (unless the Company pays any dividend or makes any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in its treasury). 
 (iv)	 Calculations . All calculations with respect to the Conversion Rate and adjustments thereto will be made to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share of Common Stock (with 5/100,000ths rounded upward). 
 (v)	 Notice of Conversion Rate Adjustments . Upon the effectiveness of any adjustment to the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 9(f)(i) , the Company will promptly send notice to the Holders containing (1) a brief description of the transaction or other event on account of which such adjustment was made; (2) the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after such adjustment; and (3) the effective time of such adjustment. 
 (g)	 Voluntary Conversion Rate Increases . 
 
 (i)	 Generally . To the extent permitted by law and applicable stock exchange rules, the Company, from time to time, may (but is not required to) increase the Conversion Rate by any amount if (1) the Board of Directors determines that such increase is in the Company s best interest or that such increase is advisable to avoid or diminish any income tax imposed on holders of Common Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock as a result of any dividend or distribution of shares (or rights to acquire shares) of Common Stock or any similar event; (2) such increase is in effect for a period of at least twenty (20) Business Days; and (3) such increase is irrevocable during such period; provided, however , that any such increase that would be reasonably expected to result in any income tax imposed on holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock shall require the affirmative vote or consent of Holders representing a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock. 
 (ii)	 Notice of Voluntary Increase . If the Board of Directors determines to increase the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 9(g)(i) , then, no later than the first Business Day of the related twenty (20) Business Day period referred to in Section 9(g)(i) , the Company will send notice to each Holder of such increase to the Conversion Rate, the amount thereof and the period during which such increase will be in effect. 
 (h)	 Restriction on Conversions . 
 
 (i)	 Limitation on Conversion Right . Subject to Section 9(i) , notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Certificate of Designations, unless and until the Requisite 
 - 36 - 

Stockholder Approval is obtained, no shares of Common Stock will be issued or delivered upon conversion of any Convertible Preferred Stock of any Holder, and no Convertible Preferred Stock of any Holder will be convertible, in each case to the extent, and only to the extent, that such issuance, delivery, conversion or convertibility would result in such Holder or a person or group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) beneficially owning in excess of nineteen and ninety-nine one hundredths percent (19.99 of the then-outstanding Stockholder Voting Power (the restrictions set forth in this sentence, the Ownership Limitation ). For these purposes, beneficial ownership and calculations of percentage ownership will be determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act. 
 Any purported delivery of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock will be void and have no effect to the extent, but only to the extent, that such delivery would result in any Holder becoming the beneficial owner of shares of Common Stock outstanding at such time in excess of the Ownership Limitation. For the avoidance of doubt, a Holder may effect an Optional Conversion, and the Company may, upon exercise of its Forced Conversion Right, force conversion of, such Holder s Convertible Preferred Stock, up to the Ownership Limitation, subject to Section 9(i) . 
 
 (i)	 Cash In Lieu of Shares Upon Optional Conversion . If, at any time after the Initial Issue Date but prior to the receipt of Requisite Stockholder Approval, a Holder elects to convert shares of Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to an Optional Conversion, as a result of which the number of shares of Common Stock that would be issued would, when aggregated with the number of shares of Common Stock previously issued upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock, exceed the Share Cap, then the Company shall, in lieu of issuing shares of Common Stock in excess of the Share Cap, pay to the Holder upon conversion an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Common Stock that could not be issued due to such limitation, multiplied by (ii) the 10-Day VWAP as of the Trading Day immediately prior to the conversion date (such amount, the Cash In Lieu Amount ); provided, however, that solely to the extent the Company is prohibited from paying the Cash in Lieu Amount to the Holder on the Share Delivery Date pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement in effect as of the date hereof, the Company shall pay the Cash In Lieu Amount to the Holder as soon as possible thereafter without violation of the terms of the Credit Agreement in effect as of the date hereof, but no later than November 5, 2026, together with interest on the Cash In Lieu Amount accrued at a rate of ten percent (10 per annum from the conversion date through the date the Cash In Lieu Amount is actually received by the Holder. 
 
 (j)	 Effect of Common Stock Change Event . 
 
 (i)	 Generally . If there occurs any: 
 (1)	recapitalization, reclassification or change of the Common Stock, other than (x) changes solely resulting from a subdivision or combination of the Common Stock, (y) a change only in par value or from par value to no par value or no par value to par value or (z) stock splits and stock combinations that do not 
 - 37 - 

involve the issuance of any other series or class of securities; 
 (2)	consolidation, merger, combination or binding or statutory share exchange involving the Company; 
 (3)	sale, lease or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person; or 
 (4)	other similar event, 
 and, as a result of which, the Common Stock is converted into, or is exchanged for, or represents solely the right to receive, other securities, cash or other property, or any combination of the foregoing (such an event, a Common Stock Change Event , and such other securities, cash or property, the Reference Property , and the amount and kind of Reference Property that a holder of one (1) share of Common Stock would be entitled to receive on account of such Common Stock Change Event (without giving effect to any arrangement not to issue or deliver a fractional portion of any security or other property), a Reference Property Unit ), then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Certificate of Designations, 
 (A)	from and after the effective time of such Common Stock Change Event, (I) the consideration due upon conversion of any Convertible Preferred Stock will be determined in the same manner as if each reference to any number of shares of Common Stock in this Section 9 or in Section 10 , or in any related definitions, were instead a reference to the same number of Reference Property Units; (II) for purposes of Section 9(c) , each reference to any number of shares of Common Stock in such Section (or in any related definitions) will instead be deemed to be a reference to the same number of Reference Property Units; and (III) for purposes of the definition of Change of Control, the terms Common Stock and common equity will be deemed to mean the common equity (including depositary receipts representing common equity), if any, forming part of such Reference Property; and 
 
 (B)	for these purposes, the Last Reported Sale Price of any Reference Property Unit or portion thereof that does not consist of a class of securities will be the fair value of such Reference Property Unit or portion thereof, as applicable, determined in good faith by the Company (or, in the case of cash denominated in U.S. dollars, the face amount thereof). 
 
 If the Reference Property consists of more than a single type of consideration to be determined based in part upon any form of stockholder election, then the composition of the Reference Property Unit will be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration actually received, per share of Common Stock, by the holders of Common Stock. The Company will notify the Holders of such weighted average as soon as practicable after such determination is made. 
 
 (ii)	 Compliance Covenant . The Company will not become a party to any 
 - 38 - 

Common Stock Change Event unless its terms are consistent with this Section 9(j) .

 Section 10.	Certain Provisions Relating to the Issuance of Common Stock . 
 
 (a)	 Equitable Adjustments to Prices . Whenever this Certificate of Designations requires the Company to calculate the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices, or any function thereof, over a period of multiple days (including to calculate an adjustment to the Conversion Rate), the Company will make appropriate adjustments, if any, to those calculations to account for any adjustment to the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 9(f)(i) that becomes effective, or any event requiring such an adjustment to the Conversion Rate where the Ex-Dividend Date, effective date or Expiration Date, as applicable, of such event occurs, at any time during such period. 
 - 39 - 

(b)	 Reservation of Shares of Common Stock . The Company will reserve, out of its authorized, unreserved and not outstanding shares of Common Stock, for delivery upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock, a number of shares of Common Stock that would be sufficient to settle the conversion of all shares of Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding, if any. To the extent the Company delivers shares of Common Stock held in the Company s treasury in settlement of any obligation under this Certificate of Designations to deliver shares of Common Stock, each reference in this Certificate of Designations to the issuance of shares of Common Stock in connection therewith will be deemed to include such delivery.

If the Common Stock is then listed on any securities exchange, or quoted on any inter-dealer quotation system, then the Company will cause each such share of Common Stock, when so delivered, to be admitted for listing on such exchange or quotation on such system. 
 
 (d)	 Taxes Upon Issuance of Common Stock . The Company will pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax or duty due on the issue of any shares of Common Stock upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock of any Holder, except any tax or duty that is due because such Holder requests those shares to be registered in a name other than such Holder s name. 
 
 Section 11.	Preemptive Rights . 
 
 (a)	 Generally . If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries offers to issue or sell, or to enter into any agreement providing for the issuance or sale (contingent or otherwise) of, any capital stock or securities convertible into capital stock of the Company New Securities to any Person Offeree ), other than pursuant to an Exempt Issuance, the Company shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, offer to sell to each Holder that is an accredited investor, as defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D of the Securities Act (each, an Entitled Stockholder ), on the terms set forth in this Section 11 a pro rata portion of such New Securities equal to (i) the number of such New Securities being offered to such Offeree multiplied by (ii) a fraction (A) the numerator of which is the aggregate number of outstanding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock held by such Entitled Stockholder on an as converted to Common Stock basis (without regard to the Share Cap) and (B) the denominator of which is the aggregate number of outstanding shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding at the time of such offering and including all shares of Common Stock issuable (directly or indirectly) upon conversion and/or exercise, as applicable, of the outstanding Convertible Preferred Stock (without regard to the Share Cap) and any other outstanding securities or rights convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for (in each case, directly or indirectly), Common Stock, including awards under the Company s equity plans and warrants; provided , 
 - 40 - 

however , that if the Company requires an Offeree to also purchase other equity securities or debt securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, any Entitled Stockholder shall also, as a condition to the exercise of such stockholder s preemptive rights pursuant to this Section 11 , be required to purchase the same class and type of securities of the Company or its subsidiaries on the same terms and conditions. 
 
 (b)	 Notice and Procedures . If the Company proposes to offer New Securities for cash, it shall deliver to each Entitled Stockholder a written notice (the Offer Notice of its intention, describing the anticipated price (or range of anticipated prices), anticipated amount of New Securities and other material terms and timing upon which the Company proposes to offer the same (including, in the case of a registered public offering and to the extent possible, a copy of the prospectus included in the registration statement filed with respect to such offering) as promptly as reasonably practicable but in any event, with respect to any offering other than a registered public offering, no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to such issuance. The Company may provide such notice to each Entitled Stockholder on a confidential basis prior to public disclosure of such offering. Other than in the case of a registered public offering, the Entitled Stockholder may notify the Company in writing at any time on or prior to the eighth (8th) Business Day following receipt of the Offer Notice whether the Entitled Stockholder will exercise such preemptive rights and as to the amount of New Securities the Entitled Stockholder desires to purchase, up to the maximum amount calculated pursuant to Section 11(a) . In the case of a registered public offering, the Entitled Stockholder shall notify the Company in writing at any time prior to the second (2nd) Business Day immediately preceding the date of commencement of such registered public offering (or, if notice of all such terms has not been given prior to the second (2nd) Business Day immediately preceding the date of commencement of such registered public offering, at any time prior to the date of commencement of such registered public offering) whether the Entitled Stockholder will exercise such preemptive rights and as to the amount of New Securities the Entitled Stockholder desires to purchase, up to the maximum amount calculated pursuant to Section 11(a) . Such notice to the Company shall constitute a binding commitment by the Entitled Stockholder to purchase the amount of New Securities so specified at the price and other terms set forth in the Company s notice to it; provided, however, if the proposed issuance by the Company of New Securities which gave rise to the exercise by the Entitled Stockholder of its preemptive rights pursuant to this Section 11 has not been consummated by the date that is sixty (60) calendar days following such Entitled Stockholder s receipt of applicable Offer Notice (the New Securities Offering Deadline ), then the Entitled Stockholder's commitment to purchase New Securities shall automatically terminate as of the New Securities Offering Deadline and the Company may not consummate the issuance of New Securities specified in the Offer Notice without again complying the provisions of this Section 11 , including providing a new Offer Notice. Subject to receipt of the requisite notice of such issuance by the Company, the failure of an Entitled Stockholder to respond prior to the time a response is required pursuant to this Section 11(b) shall be deemed to be a waiver of the Entitled Stockholder s purchase rights under this Section 11 only with respect to the offering described in the applicable notice. Purchase of New Securities . The Entitled Stockholder shall purchase the New Securities that it has elected to purchase under this Section 11 concurrently with the related issuance of such New Securities by the Company (subject to the receipt of any required approvals). If the proposed issuance by the Company of securities which gave rise to the exercise by the Entitled Stockholder of its preemptive rights pursuant to this Section 11 shall not have been consummated by the New Securities Offering 
 - 41 - 

Deadline or shall have otherwise been terminated or abandoned by the Company without the issuance of any New Securities, then the purchase rights of the Entitled Stockholder pursuant to this Section 11 shall also terminate as of such applicable date as to such proposed issuance by the Company (but not any subsequent or future issuance), and any funds in respect thereof paid to the Company by the Entitled Stockholder in respect thereof shall be promptly refunded in full. 
 
 (d)	 Waiver . For the avoidance of doubt, the preemptive rights of all Entitled Stockholders pursuant to this Section 11 may be waived on behalf of all Entitled Stockholders pursuant to a written instrument signed by the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock. 
 Section 12.	Tax Treatment . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Certificate of Designations, for U.S. federal and other applicable state and local income tax purposes, it is intended that (a) the Convertible Preferred Stock will not be treated as preferred stock within the meaning of Section 305(b)(4) of Code and Treasury Regulations Section 1.305-5(a), (b) if a conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock into Common Stock is effected, such transaction will be treated as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(E) of the Code (or similar or analogous state or local income tax law) whereby the Holder of each exchanged share of Convertible Preferred Stock is treated as transferring such share to the Company in exchange for Common Stock, and (c) the Holders of Convertible Preferred Stock will not be required to include as dividend income any amounts in respect of the Convertible Preferred Stock unless and until, and only to the extent that, dividends on the Convertible Preferred Stock are paid in cash (together, the Tax Treatment ). The Company will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Subsidiaries to, issue any securities, pay any dividend or make any other distribution (within the meaning of Code Section 305 and the Treasury Regulations thereunder) on any share of capital stock or other security convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, any capital stock of the Company, or otherwise take any action that could, in each case, reasonably be expected to affect the Tax Treatment of the Convertible Preferred Stock. The Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and agents to, report consistently with, and take no positions inconsistent with, the Tax Treatment, including on any IRS Form 1099 or IRS Form 1042-S, unless otherwise required by a change in law following the date hereof or a determination within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code. Each Holder agrees to provide, at the time it becomes a party hereto and thereinafter upon reasonable request or as required under applicable law (including if such form becomes inaccurate, expired, or obsolete), a valid and duly completed Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 certifying that such Person is a U.S. Person, or the applicable version of IRS Form W-8 (or successor form), evidencing that such Person is either (x) a withholding foreign partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes or (y) eligible for a 0 rate of withholding with respect to U.S.-source dividends under Section 892 of the Code or applicable treaty. 
 
 Section 13.	Calculations . 
 
 (a)	 Responsibility; Schedule of Calculations . Except as otherwise provided in this Certificate of Designations, the Company will be responsible for making all calculations called for under this Certificate of Designations or the Convertible Preferred Stock, including determinations 
 - 42 - 

of the Conversion Rate, the Last Reported Sale Prices and accumulated Regular Dividends on the Convertible Preferred Stock. The Company will make all calculations in good faith, and, absent manifest error, its calculations will be final and binding on all Holders. The Company will provide a schedule of such calculations to any Holder upon written request. 
 
 (b)	 Calculations Aggregated for Each Holder . The composition of the Conversion Consideration due upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock of any Holder will be computed based on the total number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock of such Holder being converted with the same Conversion Date. For these purposes, any cash amounts due to such Holder in respect thereof will be rounded to the nearest cent. 
 
 Section 14.	Notices . The Company will send all notices or communications to Holders pursuant to this Certificate of Designations in writing and delivered personally, by facsimile or e-mail (with confirmation of receipt from the recipient, in the case of e-mail), or sent by a nationally recognized overnight courier service to the Holders respective addresses shown on the Register. Notwithstanding anything in the Certificate of Designations to the contrary, any defect in the delivery of any such notice or communication will not impair or affect the validity of such notice or communication and the failure to give any such notice or communication to all the Holders will not impair or affect the validity of such notice or communication to whom such notice is sent. 
 
 Section 15.	Legally Available Funds . Without limiting the rights of any Holder (including pursuant to Section 6 ), if the Company does not have sufficient funds legally available to fully pay any cash amount otherwise due on the Convertible Preferred Stock, then the Company will pay the deficiency promptly after funds thereafter become legally available therefor. 
 
 Section 16.	No Other Rights . The Convertible Preferred Stock will have no rights, preferences or voting powers except as provided in this Certificate of Designations, the Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws of the Company, the Subscription Agreement or as required by applicable law.
