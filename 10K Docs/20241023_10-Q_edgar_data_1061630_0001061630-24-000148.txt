During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a net increase of million in the CECL reserves against our loans receivable portfolio, due to a million increase in CECL reserves, offset by charge-offs of our CECL reserves of million, bringing our total loans receivable CECL reserve to billion as of September 30, 2024. This increase primarily relates to loans impaired during the three months ended September 30, 2024, both of which were secured by office buildings. The office sector is generally facing reduced tenant and capital markets demand in recent years. These impairments are each determined individually as a result of changes in the specific credit quality factors for such loans. These factors included, among others, (i) the underlying collateral performance, (ii) discussions with the borrower, (iii) borrower events of default, and (iv) other facts that impact the borrower s ability to pay the contractual amounts due under the terms of the loan. As of September 30, 2024, the income accrual was suspended on the additional loans that were impaired as the recovery of income and principal was doubtful. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded million of interest income on these loans. In addition, our general CECL reserves decreased primarily as a result of loan repayments reducing the size of our portfolio during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The charge-offs primarily related to previously impaired loan that was resolved during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The resolution was the result of the consolidation of an office property located in Burlington, MA as a result of a loan modification that provided us an equity interest in the property. Refer to Note 19 for additional information. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had an aggregate million asset-specific CECL reserve related to of our loans receivable, with an aggregate amortized cost basis of billion, net of cost-recovery proceeds. This CECL reserve was recorded based on our estimation of the fair value of each of the loan's underlying collateral as of September 30, 2024. No income was recorded on our impaired loans subsequent to determining that they were impaired. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we received an aggregate million of cash proceeds from such loans that were applied as a

Secured Credit Facilities 
 Our secured credit facilities are bilateral agreements we use to finance diversified pools of senior loan collateral with sufficient flexibility to accommodate our investment and asset management strategy. The facilities are uniformly structured to provide currency, index, and term-matched financing without capital markets based mark-to-market provisions. Our credit facilities are diversified across counterparties, primarily consisting of top global financial institutions to minimize our counterparty risk exposure.

 The availability of funding under our secured credit facilities is based on the amount of approved collateral, which collateral is proposed by us in our discretion and approved by the respective counterparty in its discretion, resulting in a mutually agreed collateral portfolio construction. Certain structural elements of our secured credit facilities, including the limitation on recourse to us and facility economics, are influenced by the specific collateral portfolio construction of each facility, and therefore vary within and among the facilities.

 Introduction 
 Blackstone Mortgage Trust is a real estate finance company that originates senior loans collateralized by commercial real estate in North America, Europe, and Australia. Our portfolio is composed primarily of loans secured by high-quality, institutional assets in major markets, sponsored by experienced, well-capitalized real estate investment owners and operators. These senior loans are capitalized by accessing a variety of financing options, including borrowing under our credit facilities, issuing CLOs or single-asset securitizations, and corporate financing, depending on our view of the most prudent financing option available for each of our investments. We are not in the business of buying or trading securities, and the only securities we own are the retained interests from our securitization financing transactions, which we have not financed. We are externally managed by BXMT Advisors L.L.C., or our Manager, a subsidiary of Blackstone Inc., or Blackstone, and are a real estate investment trust, or REIT, traded on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, under the symbol BXMT. 
 We benefit from the deep knowledge, experience and information advantages of our Manager, which is a part of Blackstone s real estate platform. Blackstone has built the world's preeminent global real estate business, with a proven track record of successfully navigating market cycles and emerging stronger through periods of volatility. The market-leading real estate expertise derived from the strength of the Blackstone platform deeply informs our credit and underwriting process, and we believe gives us the tools to expertly manage the assets in our portfolio and work with our borrowers throughout periods of economic stress and uncertainty. 
 We conduct our operations as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income to the extent that we annually distribute all of our net taxable income to stockholders and maintain our qualification as a REIT. We also operate our business in a manner that permits us to maintain an exclusion from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. We are organized as a holding company and conduct our business primarily through our various subsidiaries. 
 
 I. Key Financial Measures and Indicators 
 As a real estate finance company, we believe the key financial measures and indicators for our business are earnings per share, dividends declared, Distributable Earnings, and book value per share. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a basic net loss per share of 0.32, declared a dividend of 0.47 per share, and reported 0.39 per share of Distributable Earnings. In addition, our book value as of September 30, 2024 was 22.17 per share, which is net of cumulative CECL reserves of 5.89 per share. 
 As further described below, Distributable Earnings is a measure that is not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. Distributable Earnings helps us to evaluate our performance excluding the effects of certain transactions and GAAP adjustments that we believe are not necessarily indicative of our current loan portfolio and operations. In addition, Distributable Earnings is a performance metric we consider when declaring our dividends.

 Distributable Earnings 
 Distributable Earnings is a non-GAAP measure, which we define as GAAP net income (loss), including realized gains and losses not otherwise recognized in current period GAAP net income (loss), and excluding (i) non-cash equity compensation expense, (ii) depreciation and amortization, (iii) unrealized gains (losses), and (iv) certain non-cash items. Distributable Earnings may also be adjusted from time to time to exclude one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain other non-cash charges as determined by our Manager, subject to approval by a majority of our independent directors. Distributable Earnings mirrors the terms of our management agreement between our Manager and us, or our Management Agreement, for purposes of calculating our incentive fee expense. 
 Our CECL reserves have been excluded from Distributable Earnings consistent with other unrealized gains (losses) pursuant to our existing policy for reporting Distributable Earnings. We expect to only recognize such potential credit losses in Distributable Earnings if and when such amounts are realized and deemed non-recoverable upon a realization event. This is generally at the time a loan is repaid, or in the case of foreclosure, when the underlying asset is sold, but realization and non-recoverability may also be concluded if, in our determination, it is nearly certain that all amounts due will not be collected. The timing of any such credit loss realization in our Distributable Earnings may differ materially from the timing of CECL reserves or charge-offs in our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. The realized loss amount reflected in Distributable Earnings will equal the difference between the cash received, or expected to be received, and the book value of the asset, and is reflective of our economic experience as it relates to the ultimate realization of the loan. 
 We believe that Distributable Earnings provides meaningful information to consider in addition to our net income (loss) and cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. We believe Distributable Earnings is a useful financial metric for existing and potential future holders of our class A common stock as historically, over time, Distributable Earnings has been a strong indicator of our dividends per share. As a REIT, we generally must distribute annually at least 90 of our net taxable income, subject to certain adjustments, and therefore we believe our dividends are one of the principal reasons stockholders may invest in our class A common stock. Refer to Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our distribution requirements as a REIT. Further, Distributable Earnings helps us to evaluate our performance excluding the effects of certain transactions and GAAP adjustments that we believe are not necessarily indicative of our current loan portfolio and operations, and is a performance metric we consider when declaring our dividends. 
 Furthermore, we believe it is useful to present Distributable Earnings prior to charge-offs of CECL reserves to reflect our direct operating results and help existing and potential future holders of our class A common stock assess the performance of our business excluding such charge-offs. We utilize Distributable Earnings prior to charge-offs of CECL reserves as an additional performance metric to consider when declaring our dividends. Distributable Earnings mirrors the terms of our Management Agreement for purposes of calculating our incentive fee expense. Therefore, Distributable Earnings prior to charge-offs of CECL reserves is calculated net of the incentive fee expense that would have been recognized if such charge-offs had not occurred. 
 Distributable Earnings and Distributable Earnings prior to charge-offs of CECL reserves do not represent net income (loss) or cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as alternatives to GAAP net income (loss), or indicators of our GAAP cash flows from operations, measures of our liquidity, or indicators of funds available for our cash needs. In addition, our methodology for calculating Distributable Earnings and Distributable Earnings prior to charge-offs 
 54 

of CECL reserves may differ from the methodologies employed by other companies to calculate the same or similar supplemental performance measures, and accordingly, our reported Distributable Earnings and Distributable Earnings prior to charge-offs of CECL reserves may not be comparable to similar metrics reported by other companies.

 (1) Total loan exposure reflects our aggregate exposure to each loan investment. As of September 30, 2024, total loan exposure, includes (i) loans with an outstanding principal balance of 21.8 billion that are included in our consolidated financial statements, (ii) 770.2 million of non-consolidated senior interests in loans we have sold, which are not included in our consolidated financial statements, and excludes (iii) 103.5 million of junior loan interests that we have sold, but that remain included in our consolidated financial statements. We have retained an aggregate 199.5 million of subordinate mezzanine loans, as of September 30, 2024, related to non-consolidated senior interests that are included in our balance sheet portfolio. 
 (2) Unfunded commitments will primarily be funded to finance our borrowers construction or development of real estate-related assets, capital improvements of existing assets, or lease-related expenditures. These commitments will generally be funded over the term of each loan, subject in certain cases to an expiration date. Excludes 247.1 million of unfunded loan commitments related to our non-consolidated senior interests, as these commitments will not require cash outlays from us. 
 (3) The weighted-average cash coupon and all-in yield are expressed as a spread over the relevant floating benchmark rates, which include SOFR, SONIA, EURIBOR, and other indices as applicable to each investment. As of September 30, 2024, all of our loans by total loan exposure earned a floating rate of interest, primarily indexed to SOFR. Floating rate exposure includes an interest rate swap we entered into with a notional amount of 229.9 million that effectively converts certain of our fixed rate loan exposure to floating rate exposure. In addition to cash coupon, all-in yield includes the amortization of deferred origination and extension fees, loan origination costs, and purchase discounts, as well as the accrual of exit fees. Excludes loans accounted for under the cost-recovery and nonaccrual methods, if any. 
 (4) Maximum maturity assumes all extension options are exercised by the borrower, however our loans and other investments may be repaid prior to such date. Excludes loans accounted for under the cost-recovery and nonaccrual methods, if any. As of September 30, 2024, 14 of our loans by total loan exposure were subject to yield maintenance or other prepayment restrictions and 86 were open to repayment by the borrower without penalty. 
 (5) Based on LTV as of the dates loans were originated or acquired by us, excluding any loans that are impaired and any junior participations sold.

 Geographic Diversification 
 (Net Loan Exposure) (1) 

Collateral Diversification 
 (Net Loan Exposure) (1)(2) 

______________ 
 (1) Net loan exposure reflects the amount of each loan that is subject to risk of credit loss to us as of September 30, 2024, which is our total loan exposure net of (i) 770.2 million of non-consolidated senior interests, (ii) 1.2 billion of asset-specific debt, (iii) 99.0 million of cost-recovery proceeds, and (iv) our total loans receivable CECL reserve of 1.0 billion. Our non-consolidated senior interests, asset-specific debt, and loan participations sold are structurally non-recourse and term-matched to the corresponding collateral loans. Geographic locations that represent less than 1 of net loan exposure are excluded from the chart above. 
 (2) Assets with multiple components are proportioned into the relevant collateral types based on the allocated value of each collateral type. 
 Refer to section VI of this Item 2 for details of our loan portfolio, on a loan-by-loan basis. 
 Portfolio Management 
 As of September 30, 2024, 88 of our loans were performing with risk ratings of 1 through 4, and the remaining 12 were impaired with a risk rating of 5. All of the performing loans were in compliance with the applicable contractual terms. We believe this demonstrates the overall strength of our loan portfolio and the commitment and financial wherewithal of our borrowers generally, which are primarily affiliated with large real estate private equity funds and other strong, well-capitalized, and experienced sponsors. 
 We maintain a robust asset management relationship with our borrowers and utilize these relationships to maximize the performance of our portfolio, including during periods of volatility. We believe that we benefit from these relationships and from our long-standing core business model of originating senior loans collateralized by large assets in major markets with experienced, well-capitalized institutional sponsors. Our loan portfolio s low weighted-average origination LTV is 62.8 , excluding any loans that are impaired and any junior participations sold, as of September 30, 2024. While we believe the principal amounts of our loans are generally adequately protected by underlying collateral value, there is a risk that we will 
 59 

not realize the entire principal value of certain investments. As of September 30, 2024, we had an aggregate 883.6 million asset-specific CECL reserve related to 20 of our loans receivable, with an aggregate amortized cost basis of 3.2 billion, net of cost-recovery proceeds. This CECL reserve was recorded based on our estimation of the fair value of each of the loan's underlying collateral as of September 30, 2024. 
 Our portfolio monitoring and asset management operations benefit from the deep knowledge, experience, and information advantages derived from our position as part of Blackstone s real estate platform. Blackstone has built the world's preeminent global real estate business, with a proven track record of successfully navigating market cycles and emerging stronger through periods of volatility. The market-leading real estate expertise derived from the strength of the Blackstone platform deeply informs our credit and underwriting process, and gives us the tools to expertly asset manage our portfolio and work with our borrowers throughout periods of economic stress and uncertainty. 
 As discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, we perform a quarterly review of our loan portfolio, assesses the performance of each loan, and assigns it a risk rating between 1 and 5 , from less risk to greater risk. Our loan portfolio had a weighted-average risk rating of 3.1 and 3.0 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 The following table allocates the net book value, total loan exposure, and net loan exposure balances based on our internal risk ratings in thousands):

 (1) Total loan exposure reflects our aggregate exposure to each loan investment. As of September 30, 2024, total loan exposure, includes (i) loans with an outstanding principal balance of 21.8 billion that are included in our consolidated financial statements, (ii) 770.2 million of non-consolidated senior interests in loans we have sold, which are not included in our consolidated financial statements, and excludes (iii) 103.5 million of junior loan interests that we have sold, but that remain included in our consolidated financial statements. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of loan participations sold. 
 (2) Net loan exposure reflects the amount of each loan that is subject to risk of credit loss to us as of September 30, 2024, which is our total loan exposure net of (i) 770.2 million of non-consolidated senior interests, (ii) 1.2 billion of asset-specific debt, (iii) 99.0 million of cost-recovery proceeds, and (iv) our total loans receivable CECL reserve of 1.0 billion. Our non-consolidated senior interests, asset-specific debt, and loan participations sold are structurally non-recourse and term-matched to the corresponding collateral loans. 
 Current Expected Credit Loss Reserve 
 The CECL reserves required by GAAP reflect our current estimate of potential credit losses related to our loans and notes receivable included in our consolidated balance sheets. Other than a few narrow exceptions, GAAP requires that all financial instruments subject to the CECL model have some amount of loss reserve to reflect the principle underlying the CECL model that all loans and similar assets have some inherent risk of loss, regardless of credit quality, subordinate capital, or other mitigating factors. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a net increase of 117.1 million in the CECL reserves against our loans receivable portfolio, due to a 134.1 million increase in CECL reserves, offset by charge-offs of our CECL reserves of 17.0 million, bringing our total loans receivable CECL reserve to 1.0 billion as of September 30, 2024. This increase primarily relates to two loans impaired during the three months ended September 30, 2024, both of 
 60 

which were secured by office buildings. The office sector is generally facing reduced tenant and capital markets demand in recent years. These impairments are each determined individually as a result of changes in the specific credit quality factors for such loans. These factors included, among others, (i) the underlying collateral performance, (ii) discussions with the borrower, (iii) borrower events of default, and (iv) other facts that impact the borrower s ability to pay the contractual amounts due under the terms of the loan. As of September 30, 2024, the income accrual was suspended on the two additional loans that were impaired as the recovery of income and principal was doubtful. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 4.9 million of interest income on these two loans. In addition, our general CECL reserves decreased primarily as a result of loan repayments reducing the size of our portfolio during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The charge-offs primarily related to one previously impaired loan that was resolved during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The resolution was the result of the consolidation of an office property located in Burlington, MA as a result of a loan modification that provided us an equity interest in the property. Refer to Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had an aggregate 883.6 million asset-specific CECL reserve related to 20 of our loans receivable, with an aggregate amortized cost basis of 3.2 billion, net of cost-recovery proceeds. This CECL reserve was recorded based on our estimation of the fair value of each of the loan's underlying collateral as of September 30, 2024. No income was recorded on our impaired loans subsequent to determining that they were impaired. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received an aggregate 24.5 million and 59.8 million, respectively, of cash proceeds from such loans that were applied as a reduction to the amortized cost basis of each respective loan. 
 As of September 30, 2024, all borrowers under performing loans were in compliance with the applicable contractual terms, including any required payment of interest. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our policies on revenue recognition and our CECL reserves. 
 Multifamily Joint Venture 
 As of September 30, 2024, our multifamily joint venture held 294.7 million of loans, which are included in the loan disclosures above, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, our Multifamily Joint Venture also held a 32.2 million REO asset. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our multifamily joint venture. 
 Agency Multifamily Lending Partnership 
 In the second quarter of 2024, we entered an agreement with M T Realty Capital Corporation, or MTRCC, a subsidiary of M T Bank, that will allow our borrowers to access multifamily agency financing through MTRCC s Fannie Mae DUS and Freddie Mac Optigo lending platforms. We will receive a portion of origination, servicing, and other fees paid under the programs for loans that we refer to MTRCC for origination. Similarly, we will share in losses with MTRCC and Fannie Mae on loans that we refer to MTRCC for origination under the Fannie Mae program. There were no loans originated under the MTRCC agreement during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 (2) Includes issue discounts, transaction expenses, and/or issuance costs, as applicable, that are amortized through interest expense over the life of each respective financing. 
 (3) The conversion price of the Convertible Notes is 36.27, which represents the price of class A common stock per share based on a conversion rate of 27.5702. The conversion rate represents the number of shares of class A common stock issuable per 1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes. The cumulative dividend threshold has not been exceeded as of September 30, 2024. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased an aggregate principal amount of 2.3 million of the B-1 Term Loan at a weighted-average price of 99 , an aggregate principal amount of 30.8 million of the Senior Secured Notes at a weighted-average price of 88 , and an aggregate principal amount of 33.8 million of the Convertible Notes at a weighted-average price of 93 . This resulted in a gain on extinguishment of debt of 25,000, 3.3 million, and 2.0 million, respectively, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Refer to Note 2, Note 10, Note 11, and Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our Term Loans, Senior Secured Notes, and Convertible Notes. 
 Floating Rate Portfolio 
 Generally, our business model is such that rising interest rates will increase our net income, while declining interest rates will decrease net income. As of September 30, 2024, all of our loans by total loan exposure earned a floating rate of interest and were financed with liabilities that pay interest at floating rates, which resulted in an amount of net equity that is positively correlated to rising interest rates, subject to the impact of interest rate floors on certain of our floating rate loans. 
 Our liabilities are generally currency and index-matched to each collateral asset, resulting in a net exposure to movements in benchmark rates that varies by currency silo based on the relative proportion of floating rate assets and liabilities.

 (4) Excludes 3.3 billion of floating rate impaired loans. 
 (5) Excludes 770.2 million of non-consolidated senior interests and 103.5 million of loan participations sold, as of September 30, 2024. Our non-consolidated senior interests and loan participations sold are structurally non-recourse and term-matched to the corresponding loans, and have no impact on our net floating rate exposure. 
 (6) Our loan agreements generally require our borrowers to purchase interest rate caps, which mitigates our borrowers exposure to an increase in interest rates. 
 (7) Includes amounts outstanding under secured debt, securitizations, and asset-specific debt. 
 (8) Includes amounts outstanding under Term Loans. 
 (9) Represents the U.S. dollar equivalent as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 In addition to the risks related to fluctuations in cash flows and asset values associated with movements in interest rates, there is also the risk of non-performance on floating rate assets. In the case of a significant increase in interest rates, the cash flows of the collateral real estate assets may not be sufficient to pay debt service due under our loans, which may contribute to non-performance or, in severe cases, default. This risk is partially mitigated by our consideration of rising rate stress-testing during our underwriting process, which generally includes a requirement for our borrower to purchase an interest rate cap contract with an unaffiliated third party, provide an interest reserve deposit, and/or provide interest guarantees or other structural protections. As of September 30, 2024, 96 of our performing loans have interest rate caps, with a weighted-average strike price of 3.5 , or interest guarantees. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest rate caps on 10.8 billion of performing loans, with a 3.4 weighted-average strike price, expired and 95 were replaced with new interest rate caps, with a weighted-average strike price of 3.4 , or interest guarantees.

III. Our Results of Operations 
 Operating Results The following table sets forth information regarding our consolidated results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 in thousands, except per share data): 
 
 Three Months Ended Change September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 Income from loans and other investments Interest and related income 430,092 466,152 (36,060) Less: Interest and related expenses 321,744 339,380 (17,636) Income from loans and other investments, net 108,348 126,772 (18,424) Revenue from real estate owned 1,214 1,214 Gain on extinguishment of debt 2,389 2,389 Total net revenues 111,951 126,772 (14,821) Other expenses Management and incentive fees 18,605 18,726 (121) General and administrative expenses 13,423 13,660 (237) Expenses from real estate owned 2,684 963 1,721 Total other expenses 34,712 33,349 1,363 Increase in current expected credit loss reserve (132,470) (152,408) 19,938 Loss before income taxes (55,231) (58,985) 3,754 Income tax provision 613 1,217 (604) Net loss (55,844) (60,202) 4,358 Net income attributable to non-controlling interests (540) (855) 315 Net loss attributable to Blackstone Mortgage Trust, Inc. (56,384) (61,057) 4,673 Net loss per share of common stock, basic and diluted (0.32) (0.35) 0.03 Weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding, basic and diluted 173,637,101 173,967,340 (330,239) Dividends declared per share 0.47 0.62 (0.15) Income from loans and other investments, net 
 Income from loans and other investments, net decreased 18.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the weighted-average principal balance of our loan portfolio by 1.2 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as well as a decline in interest income related to additional loans accounted for under the cost-recovery method during the three months ended September 30, 2024. This was offset by a decrease in the weighted-average principal balance of our outstanding financing arrangements by 1.1 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. 
 Revenue from real estate owned 
 Revenue from real estate owned increased by 1.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to additional REO assets acquired during the quarter. There was no revenue from real estate owned during the three months ended June 30, 2024. 
 Gain on extinguishment of debt 
 Gain on extinguishment of debt increased by 2.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized an aggregate gain on extinguishment of debt of 2.4 million 
 67 

related to the repurchase of an aggregate principal amount of 33.8 million, 4.6 million, and 2.3 million of our Convertible Notes, Senior Secured Notes, and B-1 Term Loan, respectively. There was no repurchase activity during the three months ended June 30, 2024. 
 Other expenses 
 Other expenses include management and incentive fees payable to our Manager, general and administrative expenses, and expenses from real estate owned. Other expenses increased by 1.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024 primarily due to an increase in expenses of real estate owned due to additional REO assets acquired during the quarter. 
 Changes in current expected credit loss reserve 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a 132.5 million increase in our CECL reserves, as compared to a 152.4 million increase during the three months ended June 30, 2024. These incremental CECL reserves primarily reflect a 124.2 million increase in the specific reserves, primarily related to two loans impaired during the three months ended September 30, 2024, both of which were secured by office buildings. The office sector is generally facing reduced tenant and capital markets demand in recent years. These impairments are each determined individually as a result of changes in the specific credit quality factors for such loans. These factors included, among others, (i) the underlying collateral performance, (ii) discussions with the borrower, (iii) borrower events of default, and (iv) other facts that impact the borrower s ability to pay the contractual amounts due under the terms of the loan. In addition, our general CECL reserves decreased primarily as a result of loan repayments reducing the size of our portfolio during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 We may be required to record further increases to our CECL reserves in the future, depending on the performance of our portfolio and broader market conditions, and there may be volatility in the level of our CECL reserves. In particular, our loans secured by office buildings have experienced higher levels of CECL reserves and may continue to do so if market conditions relevant to office buildings do not improve. Any such reserve increases are difficult to predict, but are expected to be primarily the result of incremental loan impairments resulting from changes in the specific credit quality factors of such loans and to be concentrated in our loans receivable with a risk rating of 4 as of September 30, 2024. 
 Income tax provision 
 The income tax provision decreased by 604,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024 primarily due to a decrease in the income tax provisions related to our taxable REIT subsidiaries. 
 Dividends per share 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we declared dividends of 0.47 per share, or 81.3 million in aggregate. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we declared dividends of 0.62 per share, or 107.6 million in aggregate.

 Income from loans and other investments, net 
 Income from loans and other investments, net decreased 139.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the weighted-average principal balance of our loan portfolio by 1.8 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as well as a decline in interest income related to additional loans accounted for under the cost-recovery method during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This was offset by a decrease in the weighted-average principal balance of our outstanding financing arrangements by 1.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Revenue from real estate owned 
 Revenue from real estate owned increased by 1.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to REO assets being acquired. There was no revenue from real estate owned during the nine months ended June 30, 2024. 
 Gain on extinguishment of debt 
 Gain on extinguishment of debt increased by 811,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized an aggregate gain on extinguishment of debt of 5.4 million related to 
 69 

the repurchase of an aggregate principal amount of 33.8 million, 30.8 million, and 2.3 million, of our Convertible Notes, Senior Secured Notes, and B-1 Term Loan, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of 4.5 million related to the repurchase of an aggregate principal amount of 33.4 million of our Senior Secured Notes. 
 Other expenses 
 Other expenses include management and incentive fees payable to our Manager, general and administrative expenses, and expenses from real estate owned. Other expenses decreased by 29.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a decrease of 36.8 million of incentive fees payable to our Manager, driven primarily by charge-offs of CECL reserves. Expenses of real estate owned, which relates to real estate owned operations, increased by 3.6 million. We did not incur any expenses from REO during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, general and administrative expenses increased by 2.9 million primarily due to (i) an increase in non-cash restricted stock amortization of 982,000 related to shares awarded under our long-term incentive plans, (ii) a 774,000 increase in legal expenses, and (iii) an increase of 279,000 of management fees payable to our Manager, primarily as a result of an increase in our Equity, as defined in our Management Agreement. 
 Changes in current expected credit loss reserve 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a 519.7 million increase in our CECL reserves, as compared to a 134.5 million increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These incremental CECL reserves primarily reflect a 465.9 million increase in the specific reserves related to certain impaired loans in our portfolio, most of which were secured by office buildings. The office sector is generally facing reduced tenant and capital markets demand in recent years. These impairments are each determined individually as a result of changes in the specific credit quality factors for such loans. These factors included, among others, (i) the underlying collateral performance, (ii) discussions with the borrower, (iii) borrower events of default, and (iv) other facts that impact the borrower s ability to pay the contractual amounts due under the terms of the loan. In addition, our general CECL reserves decreased primarily as a result of loan repayments reducing the size of our portfolio during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 We may be required to record further increases to our CECL reserves in the future, depending on the performance of our portfolio and broader market conditions, and there may be volatility in the level of our CECL reserves.

Any such reserve increases are difficult to predict, but are expected to be primarily the result of incremental loan impairments resulting from changes in the specific credit quality factors of such loans and to be concentrated in our loans receivable with a risk rating of 4 as of September 30, 2024. 
 Income tax provision 
 The income tax provision decreased by 1.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to a decrease in the income tax provisions related to our taxable REIT subsidiaries. 
 Dividends per share 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we declared dividends of 1.71 per share, or 296.6 million in aggregate. During nine months ended September 30, 2023, we declared dividends of 1.86 per share, or 320.5 million in aggregate. 
 
 IV. Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Capitalization 
 We have capitalized our business to date primarily through the issuance and sale of shares of our class A common stock, corporate debt, and asset-level financings. As of September 30, 2024, our capitalization structure included 3.8 billion of common equity, 2.7 billion of corporate debt, and 14.5 billion of asset-level financings. Our 2.7 billion of corporate debt includes 2.1 billion of Term Loan borrowings, 335.3 million of Senior Secured Notes, and 266.2 million of Convertible Notes. Our 14.5 billion of asset-level financings includes 11.0 billion of secured debt, 2.2 billion of securitizations, and 1.2 billion of asset-specific debt, all of which are structured to produce term, currency, and index matched funding with no margin call provisions based upon capital markets events. 
 70 

As of September 30, 2024, we have 1.5 billion of liquidity that can be used to satisfy our short-term cash requirements and as working capital for our business. 
 See Notes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 to our co nsolidated financial statements for additional details regarding our secured debt, securitized debt obligations, asset-specific debt, loan participations sold, Term Loans, Senior Secured Notes, and Convertible Notes, respectively.

Adjusted Equity is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to Adjusted Debt-to-Equity Ratio and Adjusted Total Leverage Ratio below for the definition of Adjusted Equity and a reconciliation to total equity. 
 Adjusted Debt-to-Equity Ratio and Adjusted Total Leverage Ratio 
 Our adjusted debt-to-equity and total leverage ratios are measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, as they are calculated using Adjusted Equity, which we define as our total equity, excluding the aggregate CECL reserves on our loans receivable and unfunded loan commitments. 
 We believe that Adjusted Equity provides meaningful information to consider in addition to our total equity determined in accordance with GAAP in the context of assessing our debt-to-equity and total leverage ratios. The adjusted debt-to-equity and total leverage ratios are metrics we use, in addition to our unadjusted debt-to-equity and total leverage ratios, when evaluating our capitalization structure, as Adjusted Equity excludes the unrealized impact of our CECL reserves, which may vary from quarter-to-quarter as our loan portfolio changes and market and economic conditions evolve. We believe these ratios, and therefore our Adjusted Equity, are useful financial metrics for existing and potential future holders of our class A common stock to consider when evaluating how our business is capitalized and the relative amount of leverage in our business. 
 Adjusted Equity does not represent our total equity and should not be considered as an alternate to GAAP total equity. In addition, our methodology for calculating Adjusted Equity may differ from methodologies employed by other companies to calculate the same or similar supplemental measures, and accordingly, our reported Adjusted Equity may not be comparable to the Adjusted Equity reported by other companies.

 (1) Represents loan principal payments held by our third-party servicer as of the balance sheet date which were remitted to us during the subsequent remittance cycle, net of the related secured debt balance. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated cash flow from operating activities of 281.9 million and received 3.1 billion from loan principal collections, sales proceeds, and cost-recovery proceeds. Furthermore, we are able to generate incremental liquidity through the replenishment provisions of certain of our CLOs, which allow us to replace a repaid loan in the CLO by increasing the principal amount of existing CLO collateral assets to maintain the aggregate amount of collateral assets in the CLO, and the related financing outstanding. 
 We have access to further liquidity through public and private offerings of equity and debt securities, syndicated term loans, and similar transactions. To facilitate public offerings, in July 2022, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC that is effective for a term of three years and expires in July 2025. The amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed and there is no specific dollar limit on the amount of securities we may issue. The securities covered by this registration statement include: (i) class A common stock; (ii) preferred stock; (iii) depositary shares representing preferred stock; (iv) debt securities; (v) warrants; (vi) subscription rights; (vii) purchase contracts; and (viii) units consisting of one or more of such securities or any combination of these securities. The specifics of any future offerings, along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered, will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement, or other offering materials, at the time of any offering. 
 We may also access liquidity through our dividend reinvestment plan and direct stock purchase plan, under which 9,970,314 shares of class A common stock were available for issuance as of September 30, 2024, and our at the market stock offering program, pursuant to which we may sell, from time to time, up to 480.9 million of additional shares of our class A common stock as of September 30, 2024. Refer to Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details. 
 Uses of Liquidity 
 In addition to our loan origination and funding activity and general operating expenses, our primary uses of liquidity include interest and principal payments under our 11.0 billion of outstanding borrowings under secured debt, our asset-specific debt, our Term Loans, our Senior Secured Notes, and our Convertible Notes. From time to time we may also repurchase our outstanding debt or shares of our class A common stock. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. The amounts involved in any such purchase transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased an aggregate principal amount of 2.3 million of the B-1 Term Loan at a weighted-average price of 99 , an aggregate principal amount of 30.8 million of our Senior Secured Notes at a weighted-average price of 88 , and an aggregate principal amount of 33.8 million of the Convertible Notes at a weighted-average price of 93 . This resulted in gains on extinguishment of debt of 25,000, 3.3 million, and 2.0 million, respectively, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 72 

In July 2024, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 150.0 million of our class A common stock. Under the repurchase program, repurchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The timing and the actual amounts repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including legal requirements, price and economic and market conditions. The repurchase program may be changed, suspended or discontinued at any time and does not have a specified expiration date. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 628,884 shares of class A common stock at a weighted-average price per share of 17.49, for a total cost of 11.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, the amount remaining available for repurchases under the program was 139.0 million. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had unfunded commitments of 1.6 billion related to 76 loans receivable and 717.9 million of committed or identified financing for those commitments resulting in net unfunded commitments of 844.7 million. The unfunded loan commitments comprise funding for capital expenditures and construction, leasing costs, and interest and carry costs. Loan funding commitments are generally subject to certain conditions, including, without limitation, the progress of capital projects, leasing, and cash flows at the properties securing our loans. Therefore, the exact timing and amounts of such future loan fundings are uncertain and will depend on the current and future performance of the underlying collateral assets. We expect to fund our loan commitments over the remaining term of the related loans, which have a weighted-average future funding period of 2.3 years.

 (1) Represents known and estimated short-term cash requirements related to our contractual obligations and commitments. Refer to the sources of liquidity section above for our sources of funds to satisfy our short-term cash requirements. 
 (2) The allocation of our unfunded loan commitments is based on the earlier of the commitment expiration date or the final loan maturity date, however we may be obligated to fund these commitments earlier than such date. 
 (3) Our secured debt and asset-specific debt agreements are generally term-matched to their underlying collateral. Therefore, the allocation of both principal and interest payments under such agreements is generally allocated based on the maximum maturity date of the collateral loans, assuming all extension options are exercised by the borrower. In limited instances, the maturity date of the respective debt agreement is used. 
 (4) The Term Loans are partially amortizing, with an amount equal to 1.0 per annum of the initial principal balance due in quarterly installments. Refer to Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for further details on our Term Loans. 
 (5) Reflects the outstanding principal balance of convertible notes, excluding any potential conversion premium. Refer to Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for further details on our convertible notes. 
 (6) Represents interest payments on our secured debt, asset-specific debt, Term Loans, Senior Secured Notes, and convertible notes. Future interest payment obligations are estimated assuming the interest rates in effect as of September 30, 2024 will remain constant into the future. This is only an estimate as actual amounts borrowed and interest rates will vary over time. 
 (7) Total does not include 2.2 billion of consolidated securitized debt obligations, 770.2 million of non-consolidated senior interests, and 103.5 million of loan participations sold, as the satisfaction of these liabilities will not require cash outlays from us. 
 73 

We are also required to settle our foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives with our derivative counterparties upon maturity which, depending on foreign currency exchange and interest rate movements, may result in cash received from or due to such counterparties. The table above does not include these amounts as they are not fixed and determinable. Refer to Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for details regarding our derivative contracts. 
 We are required to pay our Manager a base management fee, an incentive fee, and reimbursements for certain expenses pursuant to our Management Agreement. The table above does not include the amounts payable to our Manager under our Management Agreement as they are not fixed and determinable. Refer to Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional terms and details of the fees payable under our Management Agreement. 
 As a REIT, we generally must distribute substantially all of our net taxable income to stockholders in the form of dividends to comply with the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Our taxable income does not necessarily equal our net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP, or our Distributable Earnings as described above. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table provides a breakdown of the net change in our cash and cash equivalents in thousands): 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Cash flows provided by operating activities 281,908 347,681 Cash flows provided by investing activities 2,150,500 1,188,464 Cash flows used in financing activities (2,458,947) (1,407,463) Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents (26,539) 128,682 
 We experienced a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of 26.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net increase of 128.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received 3.6 billion from loan principal collections and sales proceeds, of which 3.1 billion is reflected in our consolidated statement of cash flows prepared in accordance with GAAP, excluding 512.1 million of additional repayments or reduction of loan exposure under related non-consolidated senior interests. Also, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we (i) repaid a net 1.7 billion of secured debt borrowings, (ii) funded 982.2 million of loans, (iii) paid 322.7 million of dividends on our class A common stock, and (iv) repaid 259.1 million of securitized debt obligations. 
 Refer to Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our loan activity. Refer to Notes 6, 7, and 14 to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our secured debt, securitized debt obligations, and equity, respectively. 
 
 V. Other Items 
 Income Taxes 
 We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We generally must distribute annually at least 90 of our net taxable income, subject to certain adjustments and excluding any net capital gain, in order for U.S. federal income tax not to apply to our earnings. To the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100 of our net taxable income, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our undistributed taxable income. In addition, we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our stockholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under U.S. federal tax laws. 
 Our qualification as a REIT also depends on our ability to meet various other requirements imposed by the Internal Revenue Code, which relate to organizational structure, diversity of stock ownership, and certain restrictions with regard to the nature of our assets and the sources of our income. Even if we qualify as a REIT, we may be subject to certain U.S. federal income and excise taxes and state and local taxes on our income and assets. If we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT for any taxable year, we may be subject to material penalties as well as federal, state, and local income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and we would not be able to qualify as a REIT for the subsequent four full taxable years. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all REIT requirements. 
 74 

Furthermore, our taxable REIT subsidiaries are subject to federal, state, and local income tax on their net taxable income. Refer to Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our income taxes. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial 
 statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. There have been no material changes to our Critical Accounting Policies described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 14, 2024, other than a supplement to the accounting policy for our real estate owned. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the accounting policy for our real estate owned. 
 Current Expected Credit Losses 
 The current expected credit loss, or CECL, reserve required under the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 326 Financial Instruments Credit Losses, or ASC 326, reflects our current estimate of potential credit losses related to our portfolio. We estimate our CECL reserves primarily using the Weighted-Average Remaining Maturity, or WARM method, which has been identified as an acceptable loss-rate method for estimating CECL reserves in the Financial Accounting Standards Board Staff Q A Topic 326, No. 1. Estimating the CECL reserve requires judgment, including the following assumptions: 
 Historical loan loss reference data : To estimate the historic loan losses relevant to our portfolio, we have augmented our historical loan performance with market loan loss data licensed from Trepp LLC. This database includes commercial mortgage-backed securities, or CMBS, issued since January 1, 1999 through August 31, 2024. Within this database, we focused our historical loss reference calculations on the most relevant subset of available CMBS data, which we determined based on loan metrics that are most comparable to our loan portfolio including asset type, geography, and origination loan-to-value, or LTV. We believe this CMBS data, which includes month-over-month loan and property performance, is the most relevant, available, and comparable dataset to our portfolio. 
 Expected timing and amount of future loan fundings and repayments : Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of each loan, adjusted for expected repayments. As part of our quarterly review of our loan portfolio, we assess the expected repayment date of each loan, which is used to determine the contractual term for purposes of computing our CECL reserves. Additionally, the expected credit losses over the contractual period of our loans are subject to the obligation to extend credit through our unfunded loan commitments. The CECL reserve for unfunded loan commitments is adjusted quarterly, as we consider the expected timing of future funding obligations over the estimated life of the loan. The considerations in estimating our CECL reserve for unfunded loan commitments are similar to those used for the related outstanding loans receivable. 
 Current credit quality of our portfolio : Our risk rating is our primary credit quality indicator in assessing our CECL reserves. We perform a quarterly risk review of our portfolio of loans and assign each loan a risk rating based on a variety of factors, including, without limitation, origination LTV, debt yield, property type, geographic and local market dynamics, physical condition, cash flow volatility, leasing and tenant profile, loan structure and exit plan, and project sponsorship. 
 Expectations of performance and market conditions : Our CECL reserves are adjusted to reflect our estimation of the current and future economic conditions that impact the performance of the commercial real estate assets securing our loans. These estimations include unemployment rates, interest rates, expectations of inflation and/or recession, and other macroeconomic factors impacting the likelihood and magnitude of potential credit losses for our loans during their anticipated term. In addition to the CMBS data we have licensed from Trepp LLC, we have also licensed certain macroeconomic financial forecasts to inform our view of the potential future impact that broader economic conditions may have on our loan portfolio s performance. We generally also incorporate information from other sources, including information and opinions available to our Manager, to further inform these estimations. This process requires significant judgments about future events that, while based on the information available to us as of the balance sheet date, are ultimately indeterminate and the actual economic condition impacting our portfolio could vary significantly from the estimates we made as of September 30, 2024. 
 Impairment : impairment is indicated when it is deemed probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due to us pursuant to the contractual terms of the loan. Determining that a loan is impaired requires significant judgment from management and is based on several factors including (i) the underlying collateral performance, (ii) discussions with the borrower, (iii) borrower events of default, and (iv) other facts that impact the borrower s ability to pay the contractual amounts due under the terms of the loan. If a loan is determined to be impaired, we 
 75 

record the impairment as a component of our CECL reserves by applying the practical expedient for collateral dependent loans. The CECL reserves are assessed on an individual basis for these loans by comparing the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, less costs to sell, to the book value of the respective loan. These valuations require significant judgments, which include assumptions regarding capitalization rates, discount rates, leasing, creditworthiness of major tenants, occupancy rates, availability and cost of financing, exit plan, loan sponsorship, actions of other lenders, and other factors deemed relevant by us. Actual losses, if any, could ultimately differ materially from these estimates. We only expect to charge-off the impairment losses in our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP if and when such amounts are deemed non-recoverable. This is generally at the time a loan is repaid or foreclosed. However, non-recoverability may also be concluded if, in our determination, it is nearly certain that all amounts due will not be collected. 
 These assumptions vary from quarter-to-quarter as our loan portfolio changes and market and economic conditions evolve. The sensitivity of each assumption and its impact on the CECL reserves may change over time and from period to period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our CECL reserves increased by 434.1 million, bringing our total reserves to 1.0 billion as of September 30, 2024. See Notes 2 and 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our CECL reserves. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Interest income from our loans receivable portfolio is recognized over the life of each investment using the effective interest method and is recorded on the accrual basis. Recognition of fees, premiums, and discounts associated with these investments is deferred and recorded over the term of the loan as an adjustment to yield. Income accrual is generally suspended for loans at the earlier of the date at which payments become 90 days past due or when, in our opinion, recovery of income and principal becomes doubtful. Interest received is then recorded as income or as a reduction in the amortized cost basis, based on the specific facts and circumstances, until accrual is resumed when the loan becomes contractually current and performance is demonstrated to be resumed. In addition, for loans we originate, the related origination expenses are deferred and recognized as a reduction to interest income, however expenses related to loans we acquire are included in general and administrative expenses as incurred. 
 Real Estate Owned 
 We may assume legal title or physical possession of the collateral underlying a loan through a foreclosure or the execution of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. These real estate acquisitions are classified as real estate owned, or REO, on our consolidated balance sheet and are initially recognized at fair value on the acquisition date in accordance with the ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations. 
 Upon acquisition of REO, we assess the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets, which may include land, buildings, tenant improvements, above-market and below-market leases, acquired in-place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities, as applicable, and allocate the fair value to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. We assess and consider fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount and/or capitalization rates that we deem appropriate, as well as other available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. We capitalize acquisition-related costs associated with asset acquisitions. 
 Real estate assets held for investment, except for land, are depreciated using the straight-line method over the assets estimated useful lives of up to 40 years for buildings and 10 years for tenant improvements. Renovations and/or replacements that improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Lease intangibles are amortized over the remaining term of applicable leases on a straight-line basis. The cost of ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. 
 Real estate assets held for investment are assessed for impairment on a quarterly basis. If the depreciated cost basis of the asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows over the remaining holding period, the asset is considered for impairment. The impairment loss is recognized when the carrying value of the real estate assets exceed their fair value. The evaluation of anticipated future cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates, capital requirements and anticipated holding periods that could differ materially from actual results. 
 Real estate assets are classified as held for sale in the period when they meet the criteria under ASC Topic 360 Property, Plant, and Equipment. Once a real estate asset is classified as held for sale, depreciation is suspended and the asset is reported at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less cost to sell. If circumstances arise and we decide not to sell a real estate asset previously classified as held for sale, the real estate asset is reclassified as held for investment. Upon 
 76 

reclassification, the real estate asset is measured at the lower of (i) its carrying amount prior to classification as held for sale, adjusted for depreciation expense that would have been recognized had the real estate been classified as held for investment, and (ii) its estimated fair value at the time of reclassification. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had three REO assets which were all classified as held for investment.

 (1) Senior loans include senior mortgages and similar credit quality loans, including related contiguous subordinate loans and pari passu participations in senior mortgage loans. 
 (2) Date loan was originated or acquired by us, and the LTV as of such date, excluding any loans that are impaired and any junior participations sold. Origination dates are subsequently updated to reflect material loan modifications. 
 (3) Total loan amount reflects outstanding principal balance as well as any related unfunded loan commitment. 
 (4) Total loan exposure reflects our aggregate exposure to each loan investment. As of September 30, 2024, total loan exposure, includes (i) loans with an outstanding principal balance of 21.8 billion that are included in our consolidated financial statements, (ii) 770.2 million of non-consolidated senior interests in loans we have sold, which are not included in our consolidated financial statements, and excludes (iii) 103.5 million of junior loan interests that we have sold, but that remain included in our consolidated financial statements. 
 (5) The weighted-average cash coupon and all-in yield are expressed as a spread over the relevant floating benchmark rates, which include SOFR, SONIA, EURIBOR, and other indices as applicable to each loan. As of September 30, 2024, all of our loans by total loan exposure earned a floating rate of interest, primarily indexed to SOFR. In addition to cash coupon, all-in yield includes the amortization of deferred origination and extension fees, loan origination costs, and purchase discounts, as well as the accrual of exit fees. Excludes loans accounted for under the cost-recovery and nonaccrual methods, if any. 
 (6) Maximum maturity assumes all extension options are exercised, however our loans may be repaid prior to such date. Excludes loans accounted for under the cost-recovery and nonaccrual methods, if any. 
 (7) This loan earns interest at a fixed rate. Cash coupon and all-in yield are expressed as a floating rate to include an interest rate swap we entered into that effectively converts the loan to a floating rate exposure. 
 (8) This loan has an interest rate of SOFR minus 1.30 with a SOFR floor of 3.50 , for an all-in rate of 3.55 as of September 30, 2024.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 For information on financial reference rate reforms, refer to Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Lending and Investment Activities The transition away from reference rates and the use of alternative replacement reference rates may adversely affect net interest income related to our loans and investments or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and the market value of our investments. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 14, 2024. 
 Investment Portfolio Net Interest Income 
 Generally, our business model is such that rising interest rates will increase our net income, while declining interest rates will decrease net income. As of September 30, 2024, all of our loans by total loan exposure earned a floating rate of interest and were financed with liabilities that pay interest at floating rates, which resulted in an amount of net equity that is positively correlated to rising interest rates, subject to the impact of interest rate floors on certain of our floating rate loans. 
 The following table projects the earnings impact on our interest income and expense, presented net of implied changes in incentive fees, for the twelve-month period following September 30, 2024 , of an increase in the various floating-rate indices referenced by our portfolio, assuming no change in credit spreads, portfolio composition, or asset performance, relative to the average indices during the three months ended September 30, 2024 in thousands):

 (2) Increases (decreases) in interest income and expense are presented net of incentive fees. Refer to Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details of our incentive fee calculation. 
 (3) Excludes income from loans accounted for under the cost-recovery method. 
 (4) Includes an interest rate swap we entered into with a notional amount of 229.9 million that effectively converts certain of our fixed rate loan exposure to floating rate exposure. 
 (5) Excludes 3.3 billion of floating rate impaired loans. 
 (6) Excludes 770.2 million of non-consolidated senior interests and 103.5 million of loan participations sold, as of September 30, 2024. Our non-consolidated senior interests and loan participations sold are structurally non-recourse and term-matched to the corresponding loans, and have no impact on our net floating rate exposure. 
 (7) Our loan agreements generally require our borrowers to purchase interest rate caps, which mitigates our borrowers exposure to an increase in interest rates. 
 (8) Includes amounts outstanding under secured debt, securitizations, asset-specific debt, and Term Loans. 
 Investment Portfolio Value 
 As of September 30, 2024, all of our portfolio earned a floating rate of interest, so the value of such investments is generally not impacted by changes in market interest rates. Additionally, we generally hold all of our loans to maturity and so do not expect to realize gains or losses resulting from any mark to market valuation adjustments on our loan portfolio. 
 Risk of Non-Performance 
 In addition to the risks related to fluctuations in cash flows and asset values associated with movements in interest rates, there is also the risk of non-performance on floating rate assets. In the case of a significant increase in interest rates, the cash flows of the collateral real estate assets may not be sufficient to pay debt service due under our loans, which may contribute to non-performance or, in severe cases, default. This risk is partially mitigated by our consideration of rising rate stress-testing during our underwriting process, which generally includes a requirement for our borrower to purchase an interest rate cap contract with an unaffiliated third party, provide an interest reserve deposit, and/or provide interest guarantees or other structural protections. As of September 30, 2024, 96 of our performing loans have interest rate caps, 
 84 

with a weighted-average strike price of 3.5 , or interest guarantees. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest rate caps on 10.8 billion of performing loans, with a 3.4 weighted-average strike price, expired and 95 were replaced with new interest rate caps, with a weighted-average strike price of 3.4 , or interest guarantees. 
 Credit Risks 
 Our loans are subject to credit risk, including the risk of default. The performance and value of our loans depend upon the borrowers ability to operate the properties that serve as our collateral so that they produce cash flows adequate to pay interest and principal due to us. To monitor this risk, our asset management team reviews our loan portfolios and, in certain instances, is in regular contact with our borrowers, monitoring performance of the collateral and enforcing our rights as necessary. 
 In addition, we are exposed to the risks generally associated with the commercial real estate market, including changes in occupancy rates, capitalization rates, absorption rates, and other macroeconomic factors beyond our control. We seek to manage these risks through our underwriting and asset management processes. 
 We maintain a robust asset management relationship with our borrowers and utilize these relationships to maximize the performance of our portfolio, including during periods of volatility. We believe that we benefit from these relationships and from our long-standing core business model of originating senior loans collateralized by large assets in major markets with experienced, well-capitalized institutional sponsors. Our loan portfolio s low weighted-average origination LTV was 62.8 , excluding any loans that are impaired and any junior participations sold, as of September 30, 2024. While we believe the principal amounts of our loans are generally adequately protected by underlying collateral value, there is a risk that we will not realize the entire principal value of certain loans. As of September 30, 2024, we had an aggregate 883.6 million asset-specific CECL reserve related to 20 of our loans receivable, with an aggregate amortized cost basis of 3.2 billion, net of cost-recovery proceeds. This CECL reserve was recorded based on our estimation of the fair value of each of the loan s underlying collateral as of September 30, 2024. 
 Our portfolio monitoring and asset management operations benefit from the deep knowledge, experience, and information advantages derived from our position as part of Blackstone s real estate platform. Blackstone has built the world's preeminent global real estate business, with a proven track record of successfully navigating market cycles and emerging stronger through periods of volatility. The market-leading real estate expertise derived from the strength of the Blackstone platform deeply informs our credit and underwriting process, and we believe gives us the tools to expertly asset manage our portfolio and work with our borrowers throughout periods of economic stress and uncertainty. 
 Capital Market Risks 
 We are exposed to risks related to the equity capital markets, and our related ability to raise capital through the issuance of our class A common stock or other equity instruments. We are also exposed to risks related to the debt capital markets, and our related ability to finance our business through borrowings under credit facilities or other debt instruments. As a REIT, we are required to distribute a significant portion of our taxable income annually, which constrains our ability to accumulate operating cash flow and therefore requires us to utilize debt or equity capital to finance our business. We seek to mitigate these risks by monitoring the debt and equity capital markets to inform our decisions on the amount, timing, and terms of capital we raise. 
 Margin call provisions under our credit facilities do not permit valuation adjustments based on capital markets events, and are limited to collateral-specific credit marks generally determined on a commercially reasonable basis. 
 Counterparty Risk 
 The nature of our business requires us to hold our cash and cash equivalents and obtain financing from various financial institutions. This exposes us to the risk that these financial institutions may not fulfill their obligations to us under these various contractual arrangements. We mitigate this exposure by depositing our cash and cash equivalents and entering into financing agreements with high credit-quality institutions. 
 The nature of our loans also exposes us to the risk that our counterparties do not make required interest and principal payments on scheduled due dates. We seek to manage this risk through a comprehensive credit analysis prior to making a loan and active monitoring of the asset portfolios that serve as our collateral, as further discussed above. 
 85 

Currency Risk 
 Our loans that are denominated in a foreign currency are also subject to risks related to fluctuations in currency rates. We generally mitigate this exposure by matching the currency of our assets to the currency of the financing for our assets. As a result, we substantially reduce our exposure to changes in portfolio value related to changes in foreign currency rates. In addition, substantially all of our net asset exposure to foreign currencies has been hedged with foreign currency forward contracts as of September 30, 2024. 
 The following table outlines our assets and liabilities that are denominated in a foreign currency (amounts in thousands):

Exhibit 99.1 
 Section 13(r) Disclosure 
 After Blackstone Mortgage Trust, Inc. BXMT filed its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), Blackstone Inc. Blackstone filed the disclosure reproduced below with respect to such period, in accordance with Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, in regard to Mundys S.p.A. (formerly, Atlantia S.pA. ). Mundys S.p.A. may be, or may have been at the time considered to be, an affiliate of Blackstone, and therefore an affiliate of BXMT. As of the date BXMT filed its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 with the SEC, Blackstone had not yet filed its Form 10-Q for such period. Therefore, the disclosure reproduced below does not include any information for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. BXMT did not independently verify or participate in the preparation of the disclosure reproduced below. 
 
 Blackstone included the following disclosure in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 
 
 Mundys S.p.A. (formerly Atlantia S.p.A. provided the disclosure reproduced below in connection with activities during the quarter ended June 30, 2024. We have not independently verified or participated in the preparation of this disclosure. 
 
 Disclosure pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Funds affiliated with Blackstone first invested in Mundys S.p.A. on November 18, 2022 in connection with the voluntary public tender offer by Schema Alfa S.p.A. for all of the shares of Mundys S.p.A., pursuant to which such funds obtained a minority non-controlling interest in Mundys S.p.A. Mundys S.p.A. owns and controls Aeroporti di Roma S.p.A. ADR ), an operator of airports in Italy including Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport. Iran Air has historically operated periodic flights to and from Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport as authorized, from time to time, by an aviation-related bilateral agreement between Italy and Iran, scheduled in compliance with European Regulation 95 93, and approved by the Italian Civil Aviation Authority. ADR, as airport operator, is under a mandatory obligation to provide airport services to all air carriers (including Iran Air) authorized by the applicable Italian authority. The relevant turnover attributable to these activities (whose consideration is calculated on the basis of general tariffs determined by such independent Italian authority) in the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was less than 50,000. Mundys S.p.A. does not track profits specifically attributable to these activities.
