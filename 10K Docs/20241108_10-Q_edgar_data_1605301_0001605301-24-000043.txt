 classes. Residential mortgages include those secured by residential properties and include home equity loans, while commercial mortgages consist of loans to commercial borrowers secured by commercial real estate. Construction loans typically consist of loans to build commercial buildings and acquire and develop residential real estate. The commercial and industrial segment consists of loans to finance the activities of commercial customers. The consumer segment consists primarily of indirect auto loans as well as personal installment loans and personal or overdraft lines of credit. 
 Residential mortgage loans are typically longer-term loans and, therefore, generally present greater interest rate risk than the consumer and commercial loans. Under certain economic conditions, housing values may decline, which may increase the risk that the collateral values are not sufficient. 
 Commercial real estate loans generally present a higher level of credit risk than loans secured by residences. This greater risk is due to several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers, the effect of general economic conditions on income-producing properties, and the increased difficulty in evaluating and monitoring these types of

 (1) Fair value is generally determined through independent appraisals of the underlying collateral, which may include various Level 3 inputs, which are not identifiable.

 Financial instruments are defined as cash, evidence of an ownership in an entity, or a contract which creates an obligation or right to receive or deliver cash or another financial instrument from/to a second entity on potentially favorable or unfavorable terms. 
 Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. If no readily available market exists, the fair value estimates for financial instruments should be based upon management s judgment regarding current economic conditions, interest rate risk, expected cash flows, future estimated losses and other factors, as determined through various option pricing formulas or simulation modeling. As many of these assumptions result from judgments made by management based upon estimates which are inherently uncertain, the resulting estimated fair values may not be indicative of the amount realizable in the sale of a particular financial instrument. In addition, changes in the assumptions on which the estimated fair values are based may have significant impact on the resulting estimated fair values. 
 As certain assets such as deferred tax assets and premises and equipment are not considered financial instruments, the estimated fair value of financial instruments would not represent the full value of the Company.

 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee by the customer. Because many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, and income-producing commercial properties. 
 
 Performance letters of credit represent conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. These instruments are issued primarily to support bid or performance-related contracts. The coverage period for these instruments is typically a one-year period with an annual renewal option subject to prior approval by management. Fees earned from the issuance of these letters are recognized upon expiration of the letter. For secured letters of credit, the collateral is typically Company deposit instruments or customer business assets. The Company recorded no liability associated with standby letters of credit as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 Less: Amortization Net Low Income Housing Tax Credit Investments Unfunded Commitments 
 The Company accounts for qualifying LIHTC investments under the proportional amortization method. Under this method, an entity amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the tax credits and other tax benefits received and recognizes the net investment performance as a component of income tax expense. During the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were no tax credits, other tax benefits or investment amortization recognized as the investment fund is not yet closed.

 General 
 CB Financial Services is a bank holding company established in 2006 and headquartered in Carmichaels, Pennsylvania. CB Financial s business activity is conducted primarily through its wholly owned bank subsidiary, Community Bank. 
 The Bank is a Pennsylvania-chartered commercial bank headquartered in Carmichaels, Pennsylvania. The Bank operates from nine branches in Greene, Allegheny, Washington, Fayette and Westmoreland Counties in southwestern Pennsylvania and three offices in Marshall and Ohio Counties in West Virginia. The Bank also has a loan production office in Allegheny County, a corporate center in Washington County and an operations center in Greene County, all of which are in Pennsylvania. The Bank is a community-oriented institution offering residential and commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, and consumer loans as well as a variety of deposit products for individuals and businesses in its market area. 
 
 Overview 
 The following discussion and analysis is presented to assist in the understanding and evaluation of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. It is intended to complement the unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-Q and should be read in conjunction therewith. The detailed discussion focuses on our consolidated financial condition as of September 30, 2024, compared to the consolidated financial condition as of December 31, 2023 and the consolidated results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Our results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. Our results of operations also are affected by our provision for credit losses, noninterest income and noninterest expense. Noninterest income consists primarily of fees and service charges on deposit accounts, income from bank-owned life insurance and other income. Noninterest expense consists primarily of expenses related to salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, data processing, contracted services, legal and professional fees, advertising, deposit and general insurance and other expenses. 
 Financial institutions like us, in general, are significantly affected by economic conditions, competition, and the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government. Lending activities are influenced by the demand for and supply of housing, competition among lenders, interest rate conditions, and funds availability. Our operations and lending are principally concentrated in southwestern Pennsylvania and Ohio Valley market areas. 

Explanation of Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to financial measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we present certain non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information in understanding our underlying results of operations or financial position and our business and performance trends as they facilitate comparisons with the performance of other companies in the financial services industry. Non-GAAP adjusted items impacting the Company's financial performance are identified to assist investors in providing a complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company s business and in analyzing the Company s operating results on the same basis as that applied by management. Although we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures enhance the understanding of our business and performance, they should not be considered an alternative to GAAP or considered to be more important than financial results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable with similar non-GAAP measures which may be presented by other companies. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found herein.

The interest income on interest-earning assets, net interest rate spread and net interest margin are presented on a fully tax-equivalent FTE basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax benefit of income on certain tax-exempt loans and securities using the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0 . We believe the presentation of net interest income on a FTE basis ensures comparability of net interest income arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practice. 
 The following table reconciles net interest income, net interest spread and net interest margin on a FTE basis for the periods indicated:

 Tangible book value per common share is a non-GAAP measure calculated based on tangible common equity divided by period-end common shares outstanding. We believe this non-GAAP measure serves as a useful tool to help evaluate the strength and discipline of the Company's capital management strategies and as an additional, conservative measure of the Company s total value.

Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition Analysis 
 
 Assets 
 Total assets increased 105.7 million, or 7.3 , to 1.6 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to 1.5 billion at December 31, 2023. 
 Cash and Securities 
 Cash and due from banks increased 79.1 million, or 115.9 , to 147.3 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 68.2 million at December 31, 2023. 
 Securities increased 63.8 million, or 30.8 , to 270.9 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 207.1 million at December 31, 2023. The securities balance was primarily impacted by the purchase of 69.8 million of collateralized loan obligation securities, partially offset by 10.7 million of repayments on amortizing securities . 
 
 Loans, Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL) and Credit Quality 
 Total loans decreased 44.6 million, or 4.0 , to 1.07 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to 1.11 billion at December 31, 2023. This was driven by decreases in consumer, residential real estate, commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans of 31.6 million, 8.9 million, 2.8 million and 2.7 million, respectively, partially offset by increases in other loans and construction loans of 1.0 million and 399,000, respectively. The decrease in consumer loans resulted from a reduction in indirect automobile loan production due to rising market interest rates and the discontinuation of this product offering as of June 30, 2023. This portfolio is expected to continue to decline as resources are allocated and production efforts are focused on more profitable commercial products. In total, 95.5 million of loans have paid off since December 31, 2023 . 
 The allowance for credit losses (ACL) was 9.5 million at September 30, 2024 and 9.7 million at December 31, 2023. As a result, the ACL to total loans was 0.89 at September 30, 2024 and 0.87 at December 31, 2023. The provision for credit losses recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a net recovery of 114,000 and was primarily impacted by the decrease in loan balances. 
 Net charge-offs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 123,000. Net recoveries for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were 551,000, or 0.07 of average loans on an annualized basis primarily due to recoveries totaling 750,000 related to a prior year 2.7 million charged-off commercial and industrial loan. 
 Nonperforming loans, which include nonaccrual loans and accruing loans past due 90 days or more, were 2.0 million at September 30, 2024 and 2.2 million at December 31, 2023. Nonperforming loans to total loans ratio was 0.19 at September 30, 2024 and 0.20 at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Accrued Interest Receivable and Other Assets 
 Accrued interest and other assets increased 7.8 million or 32.1 , to 32.1 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 24.3 million at December 31, 2023 due primarily to a 6.0 million investment in a low income housing tax credit project. 
 
 Liabilities 
 Total liabilities increased 96.3 million, or 7.3 , to 1.4 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to 1.3 billion at December 31, 2023. 
 Deposits 
 Total deposits increased 86.7 million to 1.4 billion as of September 30, 2024 compared to 1.3 billion at December 31, 2023. Time deposits increased 136.5 million and money market deposits increased 19.7 million while interest-bearing demand, savings and non interest-bearing demand deposits decreased 36.5 million, 22.3 million and 10.7 million, respectively. The changes were primarily the result of the current interest rate environment causing a shift in products to higher priced money market and time deposits. Additionally, the Bank added 70.6 million of brokered certificates of deposit during the period. Brokered certificates totaled 99.6 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to 29.0 million at December 31, 2023, all of which mature within three months and were used to fund the purchase of floating rate CLO securities which reprice quarterly. At September 30, 2024, FDIC insured deposits totaled approximately 62.4 of total deposits while an additional 15.9 of total deposits were collateralized with investment securities. 
 Accrued Interest Payable and Other Liabilities 
 Accrued interest payable and other liabilities increased 9.7 million, or 67.3 , to 24.1 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 14.4 million at December 31, 2023 primarily due to the purchase of 6.0 million of syndicated loans not yet settled and a 5.4 million unfunded commitment related to a low-income housing tax credit project.

Stockholders Equity 
 Stockholders equity increased 9.3 million, or 6.7 , to 149.1 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 139.8 million at December 31, 2023. The key factors increasing stockholders equity were 10.1 million of net income for the current period and a 2.8 million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss, which were partially offset by the payment of 3.9 million in dividends since December 31, 2023. 
 Book value per common share (GAAP) was 29.07 at September 30, 2024 compared to 27.32 at December 31, 2023, an increase of 1.75. Tangible book value per common share (Non-GAAP) increased 1.93, or 7.6 , to 27.16 compared to 25.23 at December 31, 2023. 

Consolidated Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Overview. Net income was 3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 547,000 compared to net income of 2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Net Interest and Dividend Income. Net interest and dividend income increased 757,000, or 7.1 , to 11.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 10.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net interest margin (GAAP) decreased to 3.11 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.13 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Fully Tax Equivalent (FTE) net interest margin (Non-GAAP) decreased 2 basis points (bps) to 3.12 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.14 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Interest and Dividend Income 
 Interest and dividend income increased 3.9 million, or 24.6 , to 19.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 15.9 million the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest income on loans increased 896,000, or 6.4 , to 14.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 14.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The average yield on loans increased 47 bps to 5.60 compared to 5.13 resulting in a 1.3 million increase in interest income on loans. The average balance of loans decreased 24.7 million to 1.06 billion from 1.09 billion, causing a 357,000 decrease in interest income on loans. The increase in loan yield has been driven by a reduction in lower yielding consumer loans due to the discontinuation of the indirect automobile loan product with the redeployment of those funds into higher yielding commercial loan products. 
 Interest income on taxable investment securities increased 2.3 million, or 249.9 , to 3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 940,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 driven by a 272 bp increase in average yield coupled with a 83.4 million increase in average balances. The increase in the average yield was the result of the Bank implementing a balance sheet repositioning strategy of its portfolio of available-for-sale securities during the fourth quarter of 2023. The Company sold 69.3 million in market value of its lower yielding U.S. government agency, mortgage-backed and municipal securities with an average yield of 1.89 and purchased 69.3 million of higher yielding mortgage-backed and collateralized mortgage obligation securities with an average yield of 5.49 . The increase in volume was driven by a 99.9 million increase in the average balance of collateralized loan obligation CLO securities as the Bank executed a leverage strategy to purchase these assets funded with brokered certificates of deposits. 
 Interest income on interest-earning deposits at banks increased 698,000, to 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 750,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to a 58.7 million increase in average balances, partially offset by a 51 bp decrease in the average yield. The volume increase was due in part to 30.5 million in cash received from the December 2023 sale of Exchange Underwriters ("EU"). 
 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense increased 3.1 million, or 60.9 , to 8.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest expense on deposits increased 3.1 million, or 66.1 , to 7.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 4.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Rising market interest rates led to the repricing of interest-bearing demand and money market deposits and a shift in deposits from noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing demand and savings deposits into money market and time deposits which resulted in a 93 bp, or 46.3 , increase in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This accounted for a 2.4 million increase in interest expense. Additionally, interest-bearing deposit balances increased 130.0 million, or 13.9 , to 1.1 billion as of September 30, 2024 compared to 937.8 million as of September 30, 2023, accounting for a 716,000 increase in interest expense.

Rate/Volume Analysis . The following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the periods indicated. FTE yield adjustments have been made for tax exempt loan and securities income utilizing a marginal federal income tax rate of 21.0 . The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume. The total column represents the sum of the prior columns.

 Provision for Credit Losses. The provision for credit losses recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was a net recovery of 41,000. The provision for credit losses - loans was 25,000 and was primarily due to changes in qualitative factors partially offset by changes in loan portfolio concentrations and an improvement in loss rates. The provision for credit losses - unfunded commitments was a recovery of 66,000 and was due to a decrease in the unfunded commitments and the loss rate on construction loans. This compared to a 406,000 provision for credit losses recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2023 which was required primarily due to loan growth coupled with a modeled slowdown in loan prepayment speeds.

Noninterest income decreased 1.2 million, or 48.9 , to 1,233,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease resulted primarily from a 1.4 million decrease in insurance commissions as no income was recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to the December 2023 sale of EU, compared to a full quarter of income recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Partially offsetting this decrease, the Company recognized a 138,000 gain on the sale of subsidiary following the final payment of remaining funds which were held in reserve to satisfy any liabilities recognized subsequent to the sale of EU. 
 
 Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense decreased 705,000, or 7.4 , to 8.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 9.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Salaries and benefits decreased 808,000, or 15.0 , to 4.6 million primarily due to no expense related to EU recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to the December 2023 sale, compared to 878,000 of expense recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2023, partially offset by merit increases and revenue producing staff additions. Intangible amortization decreased 181,000 as a portion of the Bank s core deposit intangible was fully amortized in February 2024 and EU intangible amortization of 47,000 was realized during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Data processing expense increased 58,000 costs associated with the implementation of a new loan origination system and financial dashboard platform. Occupancy expense increased 57,000 due to 130,000 of environmental remediation costs related to a construction project on one of the Bank s office locations, partially offset by 44,000 of EU occupancy expense realized during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Pennsylvania shares tax expense increased 48,000 due to a higher taxable base due to the increase in equity resulting from the sale of EU.

Income Taxes. Income tax expense was 747,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 564,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This change was primarily driven by an increase in pre-tax income to 4.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Overview. Net income was 10.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 479,000 compared to 9.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Net Interest and Dividend Income. Net interest and dividend income increased 1.1 million, or 3.3 , to 34.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 33.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net interest margin (GAAP) decreased to 3.21 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.31 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net interest margin (FTE) (Non-GAAP) decreased 10 bps to 3.22 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.32 the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest and Dividend Income 
 Interest and dividend income increased 11.4 million, or 25.1 , to 56.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 45.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest income on loans increased 4.6 million, or 11.6 , to 44.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 39.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The average yield on loans increased 54 bps to 5.53 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 4.99 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 resulting in a 4.4 million increase in interest income on loans. The increase in loan yield has been driven by a reduction in lower yielding consumer loans due to the discontinuation of the indirect automobile loan product with the redeployment of those funds into higher yielding commercial loan products. The average balance of loans increased 6.3 million to 1.08 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.07 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 resulting in a 297,000 increase in interest income on loans. 
 Interest income on taxable investment securities increased 5.6 million, or 195.7 , to 8.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 driven by a 245 bp increase in the average yield coupled with a 54.4 million increase in average balances. The increase in the average yield resulted in a 4.7 million increase in interest income on taxable securities and was the result of the Company implementing a balance sheet repositioning strategy of its portfolio of available-for-sale securities during the fourth quarter of 2023. The Bank sold 69.3 million in market value of its lower yielding U.S. government agency, mortgage-backed and municipal securities with an average yield of 1.89 and purchased 69.3 million of higher yielding mortgage-backed and collateralized mortgage obligation securities with an average yield of 5.49 . The increase in volume was driven by a 71.8 million increase in the average balance of CLO securities as the Company executed a leverage strategy to purchase these assets funded with brokered certificates of deposits. 
 Interest income on interest-earning deposits at other banks increased 1.2 million, to 3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as average balances increased 30.0 million and the average yield increased 13 bps. The volume increase was due in part to 30.5 million in cash received from the December 2023 sale of EU. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense increased 10.3 million, or 86.2 , to 22.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 11.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest expense on deposits increased 9.9 million, or 88.8 , to 20.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 11.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Rising market interest rates led to the repricing of interest-bearing demand and money market deposits and a shift in deposits from non interest-bearing and interest-bearing demand and savings deposits to money market and time deposits and resulted in a 112 bp increase in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This accounted for a 8.5 million increase in interest expense. Additionally, average interest-bearing deposits increased 106.5 million, or 11.6 , accounting for a 1.4 million increase in interest expense. 
 Interest expense on borrowed funds increased 410,000, or 50.9 , to 1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 805,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The average balance of borrowed funds increased 10.6 million due to 20.0 million of FHLB long-term advances added during the second quarter of 2023. The increase in the average balance accounted for a 388,000 increase in interest expense.

 Provision for Credit Losses. The provision for credit losses was a recovery of 114,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to a decrease in loan balances. This compared to a provision for credit losses of 917,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 which was required primarily due to loan growth coupled with a modeled slowdown in loan prepayment speeds. 
 
 Noninterest Income. Noninterest income decreased 3.7 million, or 48.8 , to 3.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 7.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily related to a 4.9 million, or 99.9 , decrease in insurance commissions to 4,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to the sale of EU.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 Other than loan commitments and standby and performance letters of credit, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a significant current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that are material to investors. Refer to Note 7 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this report for a summary of commitments outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Management 
 Liquidity. Liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short-term nature. The Company s primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows, loan repayments and maturities, calls and sales of securities. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are typically predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. 
 The Company regularly adjusts its investments in liquid assets based upon its assessment of expected loan demand, expected deposit flows, yields available on interest-earning deposits and securities, and the objectives of its asset/liability management program. Excess liquid assets are invested generally in interest-earning deposits with other banks and short- and intermediate-term securities. The Company believes that it had sufficient liquidity at September 30, 2024 to satisfy its short- and long-term liquidity needs. 
 The Company s most liquid assets are cash and due from banks, which totaled 147.3 million at September 30, 2024. The levels of these assets depend on our operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. Unpledged securities, which provide an additional source of liquidity, totaled 95.8 million at September 30, 2024. In addition, at September 30, 2024, the Company had the ability to borrow up to 486.3 million from the FHLB of Pittsburgh, of which 464.4 million was available. The Company also has the ability to borrow up to 88.7 million from the FRB through its Borrower-In-Custody line of credit agreement and the Company also maintains multiple line of credit arrangements with various unaffiliated banks totaling 50.0 million as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, currently these credit arrangements have remained unused. 
 At September 30, 2024, 335.7 million, or 91.4 of total time deposits mature within one year. If these time deposits do not remain with the Company, the Company will be required to seek other sources of funds. Depending on market conditions, the Company may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than it currently pays on these time deposits. The Company believes, however, based on past experience that a significant portion of its time deposits will remain with it, either as time deposits or as other deposit products. The Company has the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered. At September 30, 2024, the Bank's current deposit portfolio is 62.4 insured by the FDIC, and with additional coverage of 15.9 from the Bank's investment securities; of the total deposits held at the Bank only 21.7 are uninsured. 
 We are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position; therefore, we monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. The marginal cost of new funding, however, whether from deposits or borrowings from the FHLB, will be carefully considered as we monitor our liquidity needs. Therefore, in order to minimize our cost of funds, we may consider additional borrowings from the FHLB in the future.

CB Financial is a separate legal entity from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity to pay any dividends to its shareholders and for other corporate purposes. Its primary source of liquidity is dividend payments it receives from the Bank. The Bank s ability to pay dividends to CB Financial is subject to regulatory limitations. At September 30, 2024, CB Financial (on an unconsolidated, stand-alone basis) had liquid assets of 16.4 million. The ability to pay future dividends or conduct stock repurchases may be limited under applicable banking regulations and regulatory policies due to expected losses for future periods and/or the inability to upstream funds from the Bank to the Company as a result of lower income or regulatory capital levels. 
 Capital Management. The Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, each must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. 
 Under the Regulatory Capital Rules, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions (including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers), a banking organization must hold a capital conservation buffer comprised of common equity Tier I capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements in an amount greater than 2.5 of total risk-weighted assets. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank was categorized as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. 
 The following table presents the Bank s regulatory capital amounts and ratios, as well as the minimum amounts and ratios required to be well capitalized as of the dates indicated.

 The Company's loan portfolio is a mix of consumer and commercial credits. Overall credit exposure and portfolio compensation is managed via a credit concentration policy. The policy designates specific loan types, collateral types and loan structures to be formally tracked and assigned maximum exposure limits as a percentage of capital. Commercial lending by asset class, specific limits for Commercial Real Estate ("CRE") project types, loans secured by residential real estate, large dollar exposures and designated high risk loan categories represent examples of specifically tracked components of our concentration management process. There are no identified concentrations that exceed the assigned exposure limits. Our concentration management policy is approved by the Company's Board of Directors and is used to ensure a high-quality, well diversified portfolio that is consistent with our overall objective of maintaining an acceptable level of risk. 
 The Company's CRE portfolio totaled 464.4 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 2.8 million, or 0.6 , compared to December 31, 2023. CRE loans are concentrated in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk. 
 Management of Interest Rate Risk. The majority of the Company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. Consequently, the Company s most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk and a principal part of its business strategy is to manage interest rate risk by reducing the exposure of net interest income to changes in market interest rates. Accordingly, the Company s Board has established an Asset/Liability Management Committee, which is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in the Company s assets and liabilities, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate given the Company s business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives; and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the Board. Senior management monitors the level of interest rate risk and the Asset/Liability Management Committee meets on a quarterly basis to review its asset/liability policies and position and interest rate risk position, and to discuss and implement interest rate risk strategies. 
 The Company monitors interest rate risk through the use of a simulation model. The quarterly reports developed in the simulation model assist the Company in identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling interest rate risk to ensure compliance within the Company s policy guidelines. This quantitative analysis measures interest rate risk from both a capital and earnings perspective. With regard to earnings, movements in interest rates and the shape of the yield curve significantly influence the amount of net interest income that is recognized. Movements in market interest rates significantly influence the spread between the interest earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest paid on our interest-bearing liabilities. Our internal interest rate risk analysis calculates the sensitivity of our projected net interest income over a one year period utilizing a static balance sheet assumption through which incoming and outgoing asset and liability cash flows are reinvested into similar instruments. Product pricing and earning asset prepayment speeds are adjusted for each rate scenario. 
 With regard to capital, our internal interest rate risk analysis calculates the sensitivity of our economic value of equity EVE ratio to movements in interest rates. EVE represents the present value of the expected cash flows from our assets less the present value of the expected cash flows arising from our liabilities. EVE attempts to quantify our economic value using a discounted cash flow methodology while the EVE ratio reflects that value as a form of capital ratio. The degree to which the EVE ratio changes for any hypothetical interest rate scenario from its base case measurement is a reflection of an institution s sensitivity to interest rate risk. 
 For both net interest income and capital at risk, our interest rate risk analysis calculates a base case scenario that assumes no change in interest rates. The model then measures changes throughout a series of interest rate scenarios representing immediate and permanent, parallel shifts in the yield curve up and down 100, 200, 300 and 400 basis points with additional scenarios modeled where appropriate. The model requires that interest rates remain positive for all points along the yield curve for each rate scenario which may preclude the modeling of certain falling rate scenarios. 
 The table below sets forth, as of September 30, 2024, the estimated changes in EVE and net interest income at risk that would result from the designated instantaneous changes in market interest rates. Computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions, including relative levels of market interest rates, loan prepayments and deposit decay, and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. Changes presented in the table below are within the policy limits approved by the Board of Directors.

 Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurement. Modeling changes in EVE and net interest income require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the table presented assumes that the composition of the Company s interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured, and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the table provides an indication of the Company s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on EVE and net interest income and will differ from actual results. EVE calculations also may not reflect the fair values of financial instruments. For example, changes in market interest rates can increase the fair values of the Company s loans, deposits and borrowings. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 Based upon their evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective for the purpose of ensuring that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act with the SEC (1) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (2) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
