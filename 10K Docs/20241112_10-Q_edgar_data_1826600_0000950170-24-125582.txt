 years of experience in the development, operation and management of landfill methane-fueled renewable energy projects. The Company has operations at projects and ongoing development projects located in California, Idaho, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, South Carolina and Texas. The Company sells RNG and Renewable Electricity, taking advantage of Environmental Attribute premiums available under federal and state policies that incentivize their use. Two of the Company s key revenue drivers are sales of produced gas and sales of Renewable Identification Numbers RINs to fuel blenders. The Renewable Fuel Standard RFS is an Environmental Protection Agency EPA administered federal law that requires transportation fuel to contain a minimum volume of renewable fuel. RNG derived from landfill methane, agricultural digesters and wastewater treatment facilities used as a vehicle fuel qualifies as a D3 (cellulosic biofuel with a greenhouse gas reduction requirement) RIN. The RINs are compliance units for fuel blenders that were created by the RFS program in order to reduce greenhouse gases and imported petroleum into the United States. An additional program utilized by the Company is the Low Carbon Fuel Standard LCFS ). This is state specific and is designed to stimulate the use of low-carbon fuels. To the extent that RNG from the Company s facilities is used as a transportation fuel in states that have adopted an LCFS program, it is eligible to receive an Environmental Attribute additional to the RIN value under the federal RFS. Another key revenue driver is the sale of generated electricity and the associated environmental premiums related to electricity sales. The Company s electric facilities are designed to conform to and monetize various state renewable portfolio standards requiring a percentage of the electricity produced in that state to come from a renewable resource. Such premiums are in the form of Renewable Energy Credits RECs ). The Company s largest electric facility, located in California, receives revenue for the monetization of RECs as a part of a purchase power agreement.

segments: RNG, Renewable Electricity Generation and Corporate. This is consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker who evaluates operating results and performance. The aforementioned business services and offerings described in Note 1 are grouped and defined by management as two distinct operating segments: RNG and Renewable Electricity Generation. The Corporate segment primarily consists of general and administrative expenses not allocated to RNG and Renewable Electricity Generation. Below is a description of the Company s segments and other activities. The RNG segment represents the sale of gas sold at fixed-price contracts, counterparty shares of RNG volumes and applicable Environmental Attributes. This business unit represents the majority of the revenues generated by the Company. The Renewable Electricity Generation segment represents the sale of generated electricity and applicable Environmental Attributes. Corporate relates to additional discrete financial information for the corporate function. It is primarily used as a shared service center for maintaining functions such as executive, accounting, treasury, legal, human resources, tax, environmental, engineering and other operations functions not otherwise allocated to a segment. As such, the Corporate segment is not determined to be an operating segment but is discretely disclosed for purposes of reconciliation to the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. On February 18, 2024, for of its REG sites, the Company entered into a bill of sale, assignment and assumption agreement to sell its rights to the existing fuel supply agreement and property back to the site host in advance of the fuel supply agreement termination date and received in proceeds. The effective date of the sale, assignment and assumption agreement is October 1, 2024. The Company elected to cease operations prior to the assignment date and consequently the remaining book value of long lived assets and intangibles were impaired for . The remaining impairments included for various RNG equipment that was deemed obsolete or inoperable for current operations and in REG assets that were impacted under initial startup testing for one of its REG construction work in progress

and of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and and of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The nature of the Company s contracts may give rise to several types of variable consideration, such as periodic price increases. This variable consideration is outside of the Company s influence as the variable consideration is dictated by the market. Therefore, the variable consideration associated with the contracts is considered fully constrained. The Company s performance obligations related to the sale of Environmental Attributes are generally satisfied at a point in time and were approximately and of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company recognizes Environmental Attribute revenue at the point in time in which the customer obtains control of the Environmental Attributes, which is generally when the title of the Environmental Attribute passes to the customer upon delivery. In limited cases, title does not transfer to the customer and revenue is not recognized until the customer has accepted the Environmental Attributes.

Practical expedients and remaining performance obligations The Company recognizes the sale of natural gas and electric commodities using the right to invoice practical expedient. The Company determined that the revenues recognized as of period end correspond directly with the value transferred to customers and the Company's satisfaction of the performance obligations to date. Furthermore, with the application of the right to invoice practical expedient and in consideration that contracts related to future environmental attributes sales do not exceed one year, there were no remaining unsatisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Level 2: Inputs are market data, other than Level 1, that are observable either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets and other observable information that can be corroborated by market data. Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data, but significant to the fair value measurement. A summary of change in the fair value of the Company s Level 3 instrument, attributable to asset retirement obligations, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023 is included in Note 8. The Company s earn-out fair value liability at its Idaho agricultural digester site is determined by calculating the estimated present value of the future obligation. The present value is assessed quarterly and is based on macro-economic factors such as inflation and risk free US Treasury rates. Company specific estimates utilized include current and future interest rates, digester inlet gas flow and projected EBITDA. A weighted average probability approach is utilized for the variables discussed above. The earn-out is classified as a Level 3 financial instrument and changes in the balance are recorded in Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets and in the Royalties, transportation, gathering and production fuel within the consolidated statements of operations. Interest rate swap derivatives are classified as Level 2 financial instruments and are valued utilizing quoted forward Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index Rates. In addition, certain assets are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis when an indicator of impairment is identified and the assets fair values are determined to be less than its carrying value. See Note 3 for additional information.

to MNK for MNK to pay its dividend's tax liability arising from the Reorganization Transactions under the South African Income Tax Act, 1962 (Act No. 58 of 1962), as amended (the South African Income Tax Act ). On February 22, 2021, the Company and MNK entered into an Amended and Restated Promissory Note (the Amended Promissory Note to increase the principal amount of the loan to a total of , in the aggregate, on December 22, 2021 entered into the Second Amended and Restated Loan Agreement and Secured Promissory Note (the Second Amended Promissory Note to increase the principal amount of the loan to a total of , in the aggregate, and on December 22, 2022 entered into the First Amendment of the Second Amended and Restated Loan Agreement and Secured Promissory Note (the First Amendment of Second Amended Promissory Note to amend the maturity date to June 30, 2023, and on June 21, 2023 entered into the Third Amended and Restated Loan Agreement and Secured Promissory Note (the "Third Amended and Restated Loan Agreement and Secured Promissory Note") to increase the principal amount of the loan to a total of , in the aggregate and extend the maturity date of the loan to December 31, 2023 and on December 27, 2023 entered into the Fourth Amended and Restated Loan Agreement and Secured Promissory Note to extend the maturity date of the loan to December 31, 2033, each in accordance with the Company s obligations set forth in the transaction implementation agreement entered into by and among the Company, MNK and the other party thereto, dated November 6, 2020, and amended on January 14, 2021. The Third Amended and Restated Loan Agreement and Secured Promissory Note increased the security interest of the Company from shares of the common stock of the Company to shares of the Company owned by MNK. MNK is required to use the proceeds of any such sale of the shares to repay the note. The Amended Promissory Note has default provisions where MNK will deliver any unsold shares of the Company back to the Company to satisfy repayment of the note. Under applicable guidance for variable interest entities in ASC 810, Consolidation, the Company determined that MNK is a variable interest entity. The Company concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity, as the Company does not have a controlling financial interest and does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of MNK. Accordingly, the Company concluded that presentation of the Amended Promissory Note as a related party receivable remains appropriate. The maximum exposure to loss is limited to the Promissory Note principal and accrued interest, which totaled and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. MNK was delisted from the JSE on January 26, 2021. The MNK Board of Directors and Shareholders held its annual general meeting in March 2023 and voted to take MNK private. Employment Transactions The Company signed a long-term immaterial lease in December 2023 with a landowner in North Carolina.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Throughout this section, dollar amounts and production volumes are expressed in thousands, except for per share amounts, MMBtu, MWh, and RIN pricing amounts and unless otherwise indicated. 
 In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed under Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2023 Annual Report, and elsewhere in this report. 
 Overview 
 Montauk Renewables is a renewable energy company specializing in the recovery and processing of biogas from landfills and other non-fossil fuel sources for beneficial use as a replacement to fossil fuels. We develop, own, and operate RNG projects, using proven technologies that supply RNG into the transportation industry and use RNG to produce Renewable Electricity. We are one of the largest U.S. producers of RNG, having participated in the industry for over 30 years. We established our operating portfolio of 12 RNG and two Renewable Electricity projects through self-development, partnerships, and acquisitions that span eight states. 
 Biogas is produced by microbes as they break down organic matter in the absence of oxygen (during a process called anaerobic digestion). Our two current sources of commercial scale biogas are LFG or ADG. We typically secure our biogas feedstock through long-term fuel supply agreements and property lease agreements with biogas site hosts. Once we secure long-term fuel supply rights, we design, build, own, and operate facilities that convert the biogas into RNG or use the processed biogas to produce Renewable Electricity. We sell the RNG and Renewable Electricity through a variety of term length agreements. Because we are capturing waste methane and making use of a renewable source of energy, our RNG and Renewable Electricity generate valuable Environmental Attributes, which we are able to monetize under federal and state renewable initiatives. 
 Our current operating projects produce either RNG or Renewable Electricity by processing biogas from landfill sites or agricultural waste from livestock farms. We view agricultural waste from livestock farms as a significant opportunity for us to expand our RNG business, and we continue to evaluate other agricultural feedstock opportunities. We believe that our business model and technology are highly scalable given availability of biogas from agriculturally derived sources, which will allow us to continue to grow through prudent development and complimentary acquisitions. 
 Recent Developments 
 RINs Generated but Unsold 
 Our profitability is highly dependent on the market price of Environmental Attributes, including the market price for RINs. As we self-market a significant portion of our RINs, a decision not to commit to transfer available RINs during a period will impact our revenue and operating profit. The following table summarizes select historical data related to RINs generated, RINs sold, and RINs generated but unsold. As we self-market a significant portion of our RINs and as the RFS is based on annual compliance, any strategic decision to not monetize available RINs in a quarter could impact the timing of operating revenues recognized during a fiscal year. Realized prices for Environmental Attributes monetized in a year may not correspond directly to index prices due to the forward selling of commitments. The timing of RIN transfers can vary year over year and by period within a year and is contingent on various factors including, but not limited to: (a) the Company s expectations on RIN index price, (b) operational needs of the Company, (c) obligated parties purchase needs, or (d) the type of customer among other matters.

Second Apex RNG Facility 
 In 2022, we announced the planned construction of a second RNG processing facility at the Apex landfill. The construction of a second facility under our existing fuel supply agreement was triggered by biogas feedstock volumes exceeding production capabilities and discussions with the landfill host waste intake forecasted projections. As the landfill host continues to increase waste intake, we believe that the additional 2,100 MMBtu per day of production capacity will allow us to process the currently forecasted increase in biogas feedstock volumes. While the landfill host continues to increase waste intake, we continue to expect there could be a period where we have excess available capacity after the second facility is commissioned. We continue to incur capital expenditures for this project and continue to expect commercial operations in the second quarter of 2025. 
 Blue Granite RNG Project 
 In 2023, we announced the planned entrance into South Carolina with the development of a new landfill gas-to-RNG facility. The planned project is expected to contribute approximately 900 MMBtu per day of production capacity upon commissioning. We continue to experience delays with our interconnection, most recently due to the utility informing us of their near-term prioritization of remediation efforts from the impacts of Hurricane Helene. We continue to review various alternatives related to interconnection opportunities as part of our considerations for offtake options with the understanding those alternatives may differ from initial development project assumptions. We expect the utility interconnection initially included in our development assumptions to accept the production from this facility but will require other upgrades for their system to accommodate our interconnection. The prioritization of recovery from Hurricane Helene will delay these utility upgrades and directly impact our interconnection schedule delaying our commissioning expectation of this facility into 2027. Our pace of capital deployment for this project has slowed due to the delay of the utility and we do not expect to incur significant capital expenditures on this project through the remainder of 2024. We expect to resume capital expenditures for this project mid 2025. 
 Bowerman RNG Project 
 In 2023, we announced a planned development of a renewable natural gas landfill project in Irvine, CA at the Frank R. Bowerman Landfill. The project is anticipated to process the large and growing volumes of biogas in excess of the existing capacity of the REG facility. We currently expect facility commissioning in 2027 and continue to expect the capital investment to range between 85,000 and 95,000. As part of the agreement to develop the RNG plant, we also agreed to work with the landfill host on the landfill's management of its wellfield and its flare facility permit requirements. The landfill has proposed corresponding changes to our agreement which could have impacts to our existing, agreed upon commissioning schedule. We continue to work with the landfill on these proposed changes to assess what, if any, impact these changes could additionally have related to receipt of required regional regulatory construction permits. The project is anticipated to have production nameplate capacity of approximately 3,600 MMBtu per day, assuming currently forecasted biogas feedstock volumes that are projected to be available from the host landfill at the time of commissioning. We continue to incur capital expenditures for this project. 
 Carbon Dioxide Beneficial Use Opportunity 
 In February 2024, we signed a contract for the delivery of 140 thousand tons per year of biogenic carbon dioxide CO2 from our Texas facilities. We intend to capture, clean and liquefy CO2 at select Texas facilities, at which point it will be transported to EE North America's EENA ), Houston Texas-based e-methanol facility. The delivery term is expected to last at least 15 years and we continue to expect delivery to begin in 2027. During the second quarter of 2024, we completed initial site surveys related to locating the CO2 processing equipment. We have also received equipment proposals from multiple vendors all having prior experience with

liquid CO2 capture and processing. We continue to anticipate commissioning in 2027 and we expect the capital investment to range between 65,000 and 75,000 with capital expenditure beginning in 2025 for long lead equipment and design engineering. 
 Montauk Ag Renewables Acquisition 
 In 2021, through a wholly-owned subsidiary Montauk Ag Renewables, we completed an asset purchase related to developing technology to recover residual natural resources from the waste streams of modern agriculture and to refine and recycle such waste products through proprietary and other processes in order to produce high quality renewable natural gas to generate renewable electricity, to generate North Carolina swine RECs, and to produce micronutrient organic fertilizer alternatives (the Montauk Ag Renewables Acquisition ). 
 In connection with the July 2023 REC agreement with Duke Energy Duke ), our Board of Directors approved funding for the first phase of the North Carolina development project in September 2023. Once construction has been completed on the first phase and the facility has been fully commissioned, the project will provide sufficient capacity to satisfy the Duke REC agreement through the deployment of up to seven operational processing lines at the Turkey Creek facility. Including the original equipment acquired in the Montauk Ag Renewables Acquisition, the Turkey, NC asset acquisition, and the relocation of the Magnolia, NC site reactor to Turkey, NC, we currently expect the first phase capital investment to range between 140,000 and 160,000. 
 We continue to engage with regulatory agencies in North Carolina to confirm the means and methods of power generation from swine waste which will be eligible for Renewable Energy Credits under North Carolina s Renewable Energy Portfolio Standards in anticipation of commercial production. In early 2024, we received notification from the North Carolina Utilities Commission that the Turkey, NC location was approved for a New Renewables Energy Facility ("NREF") designation and Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity CPCN ). In the first quarter of 2024, we submitted an amendment to our NREF application, deemed complete by the public staff of the North Carolina Utilities Commission ("NCUC"). In August 2024, we received notice from the NCUC that our NREF amendment application was approved. In October 2024, we received notice from the NCUC that our application for a CPCN and registration for a NREF related to the sale of electricity to generate swine RECs was approved for public notice. We continue to work with the utility providers regarding the utility infrastructure design for the electricity interconnection. Survey and pre-construction activities for the electricity interconnection remain ongoing and in line with our commissioning schedule. 
 We signed a receipt interconnection agreement with Piedmont Natural Gas for the Turkey, NC location. This agreement is structured to coincide with the development timeline at the Turkey, NC location. Piedmont Natural Gas has submitted the design of the gas interconnection for regulatory approval and we expect the interconnection construction to begin in 2024 and be completed in line with our commissioning timeline. This gas interconnection is a necessary for the project to begin the registration process to obtain regulatory approvals under either the federal RFS or state LCFS programs. Completing this process will enable the Turkey, NC location to have ability to use the RNG to produce electricity or to inject into the natural gas supply. 
 We continue to use the pilot reactor that was relocated and previously operated prior to the 2021 Montauk Ag Renewables Acquisition. In connection with the hog space cycle times with our feedstock supply partners, the pilot reactor testing includes refining feedstock conveyance, equipment processing, product gas composition, and the composition of the solid output. We have processed tested both the biogas and micronutrient organic fertilizer alternatives. We are also continuing to staff the Turkey, NC location.	We continue to plan for a rolling commissioning schedule for the remaining processing lines through the second half of 2025. We expect to begin generating revenues in 2025 and have sufficient capacity to satisfy the Duke REC agreement after final commissioning during the second half of 2025. 
 
 The feedstock supply agreements we have signed allowed us to continue to refine our expected feedstock collection process. This process involves installing equipment on the farms under agreements, collecting feedstock and processing the waste through multiple phases of solids concentration at both the farm and our Turkey, NC location. We have completed the majority of the installation of collection process equipment on two farms for which we have feedstock agreements but continue to refine our collection methods. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we continue to bring additional farms under contract to secure additional feedstock supply. 
 We continue to develop the opportunities with Montauk Ag Renewables and can give no assurances that our plans related to this acquisition will meet our expectations. Utility interconnection, both inbound to and outbound from our centralized Turkey, NC processing facility is dependent on factors outside of our control. Our current construction timeline and costs are subject to delays or costs increases, respectively. We continue to design and plan for the development of the Turkey, NC facility to be used for commercial production. We expect the Magnolia, NC location to be used for various feedstock processing needs. Based on our current development timeline expectations, we do not expect to commence significant revenue generating activities until 2025. We intend to contract with additional farms to secure feedstock sources for future production processes.

Waste-stream Biogas Recovery 
 In October 2024, a collaboration with Emvolon was announced to transform methane emissions from waste stream biogas into high-value carbon negative fuel. Leveraging Emvolon's patented technology, the initial pilot is a small-scale demonstration of recovering and converting biogas into green methanol. We expect the pilot to take place at our Atascocita facility in Houston, Texas. The pilot is designed to provide proof of concept to eventually move to a commercial facility capable of producing up to 15 thousand gallons of green methanol per year and may eventually lead to a full-scale, commercial system capable of producing up to 2,400 gallons of methanol annually at the same or similar sites. We do not expect short term financial benefits from this demonstration nor a disruption to our operations. 
 Key Trends 
 Market Trends Affecting the Renewable Fuel Market 
 We believe rising demand for RNG is attributable to a variety of factors, including growing public support for renewable energy, U.S. governmental actions to increase energy independence, environmental concerns increasing demand for natural gas powered vehicles, job creation, and increasing investment in the renewable energy sector. 
 Key drivers for the long-term growth of RNG include the following factors: 
 Regulatory or policy initiatives, including the federal RFS program and state or national-level low-carbon fuel programs in states such as California and Oregon or Canada, that drive demand for RNG and its derivative Environmental Attributes (as further described below). 

Efficiency, mobility and capital cost flexibility in RNG operations enable them to compete successfully in multiple markets. Our operating model is nimble, as we commonly use modular equipment; our RNG processing equipment is more efficient than its fossil-fuel counterparts. 

Demand for compressed natural gas CNG from natural gas-fueled vehicles. The RNG we create is pipeline quality and can be used for transportation fuel when converted to CNG. CNG is commonly used by medium-duty fleets that are close to fueling stations, such as city fleets, local delivery trucks and waste haulers. 

Regulatory requirements, market pressure and public relations challenges increase the time, cost and difficulty of permitting new fossil fuel-fired facilities. 

Factors Affecting Our Future Operating Results: 
 Conversion of Electricity Projects to RNG Projects: 
 We continue to evaluate opportunities to convert our remaining facilities from Renewable Electricity to RNG production. These opportunities tend to be most attractive for any merchant electricity facilities given the favorable economics for the combined sale of RNG and RINs relative to the combined sale of market rate electricity and RECs. This strategy has been an increasingly attractive avenue for growth since 2014 when RNG from landfills became eligible for D3 RINs. However, during the conversion of a project, there is a gap in production while the electricity project is offline until it commences operation as an RNG facility, which can adversely affect us. This timing effect may adversely affect our operating results as a result of our potential conversion of Renewable Electricity projects. Upon completion of a conversion, we expect that the increase in revenue upon commencement of RNG production will more than offset the loss of revenue from Renewable Electricity production. Historically, we have taken advantage of these opportunities on a gradual basis at our merchant electricity facilities, such as Atascocita and Coastal Plains. 
 Acquisition and Development Pipeline 
 The timing and extent of our development pipeline affects our operating results due to: 
 Impact of Higher Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Prior to the Commencement of a Project s Operation: We incur significant expenses in the development of new RNG projects. Under the Biogas Regulatory Reform Rule, effective July 1, 2024, theoretical storage of RNG for future RIN generation prior to receiving EPA registration is no longer permitted and the receipt of RINs will no longer be delayed after injecting RNG into a pipeline. We expect the elimination of theoretical storage, when combined with more timely EPA registration, to not materially impact the commencement of RIN revenue generation after pipeline injection. 

Shifts in Revenue Composition for Projects from New Fuel Sources: As we expand into livestock farm projects, our revenue composition from Environmental Attributes will change. We believe that livestock farms offer us a 

30 

Table of Contents 

lucrative opportunity, as the value of LCFS credits for dairy farm projects, for example, are a multiple of those realized from landfill projects due to the significantly more attractive CI score of livestock farms. 

Incurrence of Expenses Associated with Pursuing Prospective Projects That Do Not Come to Fruition: We incur expenses to pursue prospective projects with the goal of a site host accepting our proposal or being awarded a project in a competitive bidding process. Historically, we have evaluated opportunities which we decided not to pursue further due to the prospective project not meeting our internal investment thresholds or a lack of success in a competitive bidding process. To the extent we seek to pursue a greater number of projects or bidding for projects becomes more competitive, our expenses may increase. 

Regulatory, Environmental and Social Trends 
 Regulatory, environmental and social factors are key drivers that incentivize the development of RNG and Renewable Electricity projects and influence the economics of these projects. We are subject to the possibility of legislative and regulatory changes to certain incentives, such as RINs, RECs and GHG initiatives. On July 12, 2023, the EPA issued final rules in the Federal Register for the RFS volume requirements for 2023-2025. Final volumes for cellulosic biofuel were set at 838, 1,090 and 1,376 million D3 RINs for the three years 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively. While new RNG projects in the US in 2024 have grown at a rate of approximately 20 over 2023, there is still a shortage of cellulosic biofuel (D3 RINs) compared to the volumes set for 2024 and 2025. While the EPA denied all small refinery exemptions in 2022, a federal appeals court rejected EPA s denial of these small refinery exemptions in July 2024. This appeal, along with the shortfall of cellulosic biofuels (D3 RINs) are expected to impact a future EPA action possibly in 2025 to balance the market. The final rule also included significant changes to the existing RFS program, referred to as biogas regulatory reform, that will require the RNG industry to modify how all RINs are generated. New RFS participating facilities that register July 1, 2024, or after will have to meet the biogas regulatory reform provisions beginning July 1, 2024. Existing RFS participating facilities which registered prior to July 1, 2024, will have until January 1, 2025, to come into compliance with biogas regulatory reforms. For existing registrants, registration updates must be submitted by October 1, 2024. On January 1, 2025, all RFS participants must comply with biogas regulatory reform provisions. The EPA finalized a limitation that biogas from one facility has a single use under the RFS as proposed (i.e., biointermediate, RNG or CNG/LNG via biogas closed distribution system). The EPA clarified that this does not preclude non-RFS uses at same facility. 
 The EPA has indicated it will not meet the statutorily required deadline of November 2024 to finalize 2026 obligations under the RFS. The EPA expects to target March 2025 to propose RFS obligations for 2026. 
 In December 2023, CARB released the formal proposal for new LCFS rules. CARB held a public workshop for the proposed rules on April 10, 2024. In early October 2024, CARB released another set of 15-day amendments with the most notable near-term change of increasing CI reduction stringency from 5 to 9 in 2025 along with a 20 to 30 reduction by 2030. The proposed rule also creates a 2045 target of 90 reduction. This reduction would have the potential impact of reducing the number of net credits in the program. A public hearing for the proposed rule is set for November 8, 2024. Final rules are expected to be submitted to CARB s board for approval sometime in the first quarter of 2025. The industry may see pricing volatility including potential increase to LCFS credit prices. However, price increases are not anticipated until after 2025. Also in the proposed rules is a phase-out of avoided methane crediting for dairy and swine manure pathways by 2040 for CNG usage and through 2045 for RNG used to produce hydrogen. RNG projects with avoided methane that were certified before the effective date of the new regulation will be allowed three consecutive 10-year crediting periods. Avoided methane RNG projects that break ground on or after the effective date of the regulation and before January 1, 2030, will be allowed up to two consecutive 10-year crediting periods. If the executive officer of CARB approves a gas map by July 1, 2026, then physical flow of gas to California must be demonstrated by December 31, 2037. If no gas map is approved, the proposed rules will allow reporting entities until January 1, 2041 to demonstrate gas flow. 
 The LCFS program require annual verification of the CI score assigned to a project. Annual verification could significantly affect the profitability of a project, particularly in the case of a livestock farm project. 
 Factors Affecting Revenue 
 Our total operating revenues include renewable energy and related sales of Environmental Attributes. Renewable energy sales primarily consist of the sale of biogas, including LFG and ADG, which is either sold or converted to Renewable Electricity. Environmental Attributes are generated and monetized from the renewable energy. 
 We report revenues from two operating segments: Renewable Natural Gas and Renewable Electricity Generation. Corporate relates to additional discrete financial information for the corporate function; primarily used as a shared service center for maintaining functions such as executive, accounting, treasury, legal, human resources, tax, environmental, engineering, and other operations functions not otherwise allocated to a segment. As such, the Corporate segment is not determined to be an operating segment but is discretely disclosed for purposes of reconciliation to the Company s consolidated financial statements.

Table of Contents 

Renewable Natural Gas Revenues : We record revenues from the production and sale of RNG and the generation and sale of the Environmental Attributes derived from RNG, such as RINs and LCFS credits. Our RNG revenues from Environmental Attributes are recorded net of a portion of Environmental Attributes shared with off-take counterparties as consideration for such counterparties using the RNG as a transportation fuel. We have certain pathway provider sharing arrangements expiring at the end of 2024. While we have not experienced a significant increase in Environmental Attributes shared with pathway providers related to our current renewals in 2024, our current pathway renewals have been at higher percentages than our historical counterparty share percentages. We are seeing current proposed pathway renewals for percentages significantly higher than our historical arrangements. Historically, we have monetized less than 25 of our RNG volumes under these fixed-price agreements. The Company is considering its entry into multiple short term contracts throughout 2025, some potentially increasing its historical percentage of volumes monetized under fixed-price arrangements, to provide time for mitigation of these recent market trends. 

Renewable Electricity Generation Revenues: We record revenues from the production and sale of Renewable Electricity and the generation and sale of the Environmental Attributes, such as RECs, derived from Renewable Electricity. All of our Renewable Electricity production is monetized under fixed-price PPAs from our existing operating projects. 

Corporate Revenues: Corporate reports realized and unrealized gains or losses under our gas hedge programs. The Company does not have any active gas hedge programs. Corporate also relates to additional discrete financial information for the corporate function; primarily used as a shared service center for maintaining functions such as executive, accounting, treasury, legal, human resources, tax, environmental, engineering and other operations functions not otherwise allocated to a segment. 

Our operating revenues are priced based on published index prices which can be influenced by factors outside our control, such as market impacts on commodity pricing and regulatory developments. With our royalty payments structured as a percentage of revenue, royalty payments fluctuate with changes in revenues. Due to these factors, we place a primary focus on managing production volumes and operating and maintenance expenses as these factors are more controllable by us. 
 RNG Production 
 Our RNG production levels are subject to fluctuations based on numerous factors, including: 
 Disruptions to Production : Disruptions to waste placement operations at our active landfill sites, severe weather events, or failure or degradation of our or a landfill operator s equipment or interconnection or transmission problems could result in a reduction of our RNG production. We strive to proactively address any issues that may arise through preventative maintenance, process improvement and flexible redeployment of equipment to maximize production and useful life. 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, we began to experience trends with several of our landfill hosts delaying its installation of or delaying our ability to install wellfield collection infrastructure in active waste placement areas, a practice historically common and critical to our projections of feedstock gas and, therefore, production. These landfill-driven delays will impact the timing of collection system enhancement installations and the resulting timing of our production increases. We expect these trends to continue through 2025. 

Despite collaboration with the landfill host at our Rumpke facility on our gas collection efforts, wellfield extraction environmental factors continue to impact gas extraction at the site. While the landfill continues to expand its waste intake and we continue to expand wellfield collection, our volumes have been impacted during 2024. Mitigation efforts related to wellfield environmental factors will continue in in 2025 as the benefits from 2024 efforts have not currently achieve anticipated results. 

Similar wellfield extraction environmental factors have begun to impact gas extraction at our Apex site. We have initiated collaboration efforts with the landfill to mitigate these impacts but we expect these mitigation efforts to continue in 2025. 

The landfill host changes to their wellfield collection system at our McCarty facility has contributed to elevated nitrogen in the feedstock received by our facility. Additionally, the landfill host modified the wellfield bifurcation approach which has impacted the quantity of feedstock received at our facility. We are working with the landfill host but continue to have lower volumes of feedstock available to be processed at the McCarty facility.

Table of Contents 

Quality of Biogas: We are reliant upon the quality and availability of biogas from our site partners. The quality of the waste at our landfill project sites is subject to change based on the volume and type of waste accepted. Variations in the quality of the biogas could affect our RNG production levels. At three of our projects, we operate the wellfield collection system, which allows greater control over the quality and consistency of the collected biogas. At two of our projects, McCarty and Galveston, we have operating and management agreements by which we earn revenue for managing the wellfield collection systems. Additionally, our dairy farm project benefits from the consistency of feedstock and controlled environment of collection of waste to improve biogas quality. 

RNG Production from Our Growth Projects: We anticipate increased production at certain of our existing projects as open landfills continue to take in additional waste and the amount of gas available for collection increases. Delays in commencement of production or extended commissioning issues at a new project or a conversion project, such as those we are currently experiencing at Blue Granite as described above, would delay any realization of production from that project. 

Pricing 
 Our Renewable Natural Gas and Renewable Electricity Generation segments revenues are primarily driven by the prices under our off-take agreements and PPAs and the amount of RNG and Renewable Electricity that we produce. We sell the RNG produced from our projects under a variety of termed agreements to counterparties, with contract terms varying from three years to five years. Our contracts with counterparties are typically structured to be based on varying natural gas price indices for the RNG produced. All of the Renewable Electricity produced at our biogas-to-electricity projects is sold under long-term contracts to creditworthy counterparties, typically under a fixed price arrangement with escalators. 
 The pricing of Environmental Attributes, which accounts for a substantial portion of our revenues, is subject to volatility based on a variety of factors, including regulatory and administrative actions and commodity pricing. 
 The sale of RINs, which is subject to market price fluctuations, accounts for a substantial portion of our revenues. We manage against the risk of these fluctuations through forward sales of RINs, with heavy emphasis on direct sales to obligated parties. Realized prices for Environmental Attributes monetized in a year may not correspond directly to index prices due to the forward selling of commitments. 
 Factors Affecting Operating Expenses 
 Our operating expenses include royalties, transportation, gathering and production fuel expenses, project operating and maintenance expenses, general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, net loss (gain) on sale of assets, impairment loss and transaction costs. Our operating expenses can be subject to inflationary cost increases that are largely out of our control. 
 Project Operating and Maintenance Expenses : Operating and maintenance expenses primarily consist of expenses related to the collection and processing of biogas, including biogas collection system operating and maintenance expenses, biogas processing, operating and maintenance expenses, and related labor and overhead expenses. At the project level, this includes all labor and benefit costs, ongoing corrective and proactive maintenance, project level utility charges, rent, health and safety, employee communication, and other general project level expenses. Unanticipated feedstock processing or gas conditioning equipment failures occurring outside our planned preventative maintenance program can increase project operating and maintenance expenses and reduce production volumes. The timing of gas conditioning and process equipment preventative maintenance intervals could impact the timing and amount of our operating and maintenance expenses within a given quarter. 

Royalties, Transportation, Gathering and Production Fuel Expenses: Royalties represent payments made to our facility hosts, typically structured as a percentage of revenue. Transportation and gathering expenses include capacity and metering expenses representing the costs of delivering our RNG and Renewable Electricity production to our customers. These expenses include payments to pipeline operators and other agencies that allow for the transmission of our gas and electricity commodities to end users. Production fuel expenses generally represent alternative royalty payments based on quantity usage of biogas feedstock. 

General and Administrative Expenses: General and administrative expenses primarily consist of corporate expenses and unallocated support functions for our operating facilities, including personnel costs for executive, finance, accounting, investor relations, legal, human resources, operations, engineering, environmental registration and reporting, health and safety, IT and other administrative personnel and professional fees and general corporate expenses. From time to time, we may be parties to legal proceedings arising in the normal 

33 

Table of Contents 

course of business which could increase our legal expenses. We expect increased general and administrative expenses associated with our ongoing development of Montauk Ag Renewables in 2024. In August 2024, we accelerated the vesting of certain restricted share awards to a non-executive which were unvested as of June 30, 2024 as a result of the termination of the employee. We recognized 2,911 of non-cash stock compensation expense within general and administration expenses which will not be recurring. We account for share-based compensation related to grants made through its equity and incentive compensation plan under FASB ASC 718. For more information, see Note 14 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements related to share-based compensation. 

Depreciation and Amortization: Expenses related to the recognition of the useful lives of our intangible and fixed assets. We spend significant capital to build and own our facilities. In addition to development capital, we annually reinvest to maintain these facilities. 

Impairment Loss: Expenses related to reductions in the carrying value(s) of fixed and/or intangible assets based on periodic evaluations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. 

Transaction Costs: Transaction costs primarily consist of expenses incurred for due diligence and other activities related to potential acquisitions and other strategic transactions. 

Key Operating Metrics 
 Total operating revenues reflect both sales of renewable energy and sales of related Environmental Attributes. As a result, our revenues are primarily affected by unit production of RNG and Renewable Electricity, production of Environmental Attributes, and the prices at which we monetize such production. Set forth below is an overview of these key metrics: 
 Production volumes: We review performance by site based on unit of production calculations for RNG and Renewable Electricity, measured in terms of MMBtu and MWh, respectively. While unit of production measurements can be influenced by facility maintenance schedules, the metric is used to measure the efficiency of operations and the impact of optimization improvement initiatives. We monetize a majority of our RNG commodity production under variable-price agreements, based on indices. A portion of our Renewable Natural Gas segment commodity production is monetized under fixed-priced contracts. Our Renewable Electricity Generation segment commodity production is primarily monetized under fixed-priced PPAs. 

Production of Environmental Attributes: We monetize Environmental Attributes derived from our production of RNG and Renewable Electricity. We carry-over a portion of the RINs generated from RNG production to the following year and monetize the carried over RINs in such following calendar year. A majority of our Renewable Natural Gas segment Environmental Attributes are self-monetized. A majority of our Renewable Electricity Generation segment Environmental Attributes are monetized as a component of our fixed-price PPAs. 

Average realized price per unit of production: Our profitability is highly dependent on the commodity prices for natural gas and electricity, and the Environmental Attribute prices for RINs, LCFS credits, and RECs. Realized prices for Environmental Attributes monetized in a year may not correspond directly with that year s production as attributes may be carried over and subsequently monetized. Realized prices for Environmental Attributes monetized in a year may not correspond directly to index prices due to the forward selling of commitments.

Revenues for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Total revenues in the third quarter of 2024 were 65,917 an increase of 10,229 (18.4 compared to 55,688 in the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily related to an increase in the number of RINs we self-marketed from 2024 RNG production in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. In addition, realized RIN pricing increased approximately 9.5 during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 Renewable Natural Gas Revenues 
 We produced 1,392 MMBtu of RNG during the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 12 MMBtu (0.9 compared to 1,380 MMBtu produced in the third quarter of 2023. Our Pico facility produced 27 MMBtu more in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 as a result of commissioning our dairy digestion expansion project. Our Raeger facility produced 15 MMBtu more in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 as a result of plant processing equipment improvements and increased inlet flows. Our Galveston and Coastal facilities produced 27 more MMBtu in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 due to previously disclosed third quarter of 2023 dry weather conditions impacting gas feedstock availability. Our Rumpke facility produced 59 fewer MMBtu in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 as a result of reduced feedstock inlet due to ongoing wellfield extraction environmental factors. Our Atascocita facility produced 22 fewer MMBtu in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 as a result of weather driven utility outages which impacted our production. 
 Revenues from the Renewable Natural Gas segment in the third quarter of 2024 were 61,750, an increase of 10,815 (21.2 compared to 50,935 in the third quarter of 2023. Average commodity pricing for natural gas for the third quarter of 2024 was 2.16 per MMBtu, 15.3 lower than the third quarter of 2023. During the third quarter of 2024, we self-monetized 15,750 RINs, representing a 2,000 increase (14.5 compared to 13,750 in the third quarter of 2023. Average pricing realized on RIN sales during the third quarter of 2024 was 3.34 as compared to 3.05 in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 9.5 . This compares to the average D3 RIN index price for the third quarter of 2024 of 3.36 as compared to 3.01 in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of approximately 11.6 . At September 30, 2024, we had approximately 308 MMBtu available for RIN generation and we had approximately 146 RINs generated and unsold. At September 30, 2023, we had approximately 320 MMBtu available for RIN generation and 764 RINs generated and unsold. 
 Renewable Electricity Generation Revenues 
 We produced approximately 41 MWh in Renewable Electricity in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 7 MWh (14.6 from 48 MWh in the third quarter of 2023. Our Security facility produced approximately 5 MWh less in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 as a result us ceasing operations in connection with the first quarter of 2024 sale of the gas rights back to the landfill host.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures: 
 The following table presents EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP financial measures, for each of the periods presented below. We present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because we believe the measures assist investors in analyzing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. In addition, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are financial measurements of performance that management and the board of directors use in their financial and operational decision-making and in the determination of certain compensation programs. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental performance measures that are not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss) or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities or a measure of our liquidity or profitability.

Amended Credit Agreement 
 On December 21, 2021, the Company entered into the Fourth Amendment with Comerica and certain other financial institutions. The current credit agreement, which is secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets and assets of certain of our subsidiaries, provides for a five-year 80,000 term loan, a five-year 120,000 revolving credit facility, and a 75,000 accordion feature. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 58,000 was outstanding under the term loan and we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. The term loan amortizes in quarterly installments of 2,000 through 2024, then increases to 3,000 through 2026, with a final payment of 32,000 in late 2026 with an interest rate of 6.12 and 6.11 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The revolving and term loans under the Amended Credit Agreement bore interest at the BSBY plus an applicable margin based on our Total Leverage Ratio (in each case, as those terms are defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) as of September 30, 2024. The BSBY will cease on November 15, 2024, and the current debt agreement was amended to utilize the SOFR, plus an applicable margin. 
 The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary covenants applicable to us and certain of our subsidiaries, including financial covenants. The Amended Credit Agreement is subject to customary events of default, and contemplates that we would be in default if, for any fiscal quarter (x) the average monthly D3 RIN price (as determined in accordance with the Amended Credit Agreement) is less than 0.80 per RIN and (y) the consolidated EBITDA for such quarter is less than 6,000. Consolidated EBITDA is defined under the Amended Credit Agreement as net income plus (a) income tax expense, (b) interest expense, (c) depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense, (d) non-cash unrealized derivative expense and (e) any other extraordinary, unusual, or non-recurring adjustments to certain components of net income, as agreed upon by Comerica in certain circumstances. 
 Under the Amended Credit Agreement, we are required to maintain the following ratios: 
 a Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) of not more than 3.00 to 1.00 as of the end of any fiscal quarter from June 30, 2024 and thereafter; and 

as of the end of each fiscal quarter, a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) of not less than 1.2 to 1.0. 

As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all applicable financial covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement. 
 The Amended Credit Agreement replaced our prior credit agreements with Comerica and a portion of the proceeds of the term loan made under the Amended Credit Agreement were used by us to, among other things, fully satisfy an aggregate of 59,197 outstanding principal under such credit agreements. For additional information regarding the Amended Credit Agreement, see Note 12 Debt to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 We have historically funded our growth and capital expenditures with our working capital, cash flow from operations and debt financing. We expect our non-development 2024 capital expenditures to range between 14,000 and 16,000. Our 2024 capital plans include annual preventative maintenance expenditures, annual wellfield expansion projects, other specific facility improvements, and information technology improvements. Additionally, we currently estimate that our existing 2024 development capital expenditures will range between 55,000 and 65,000. The refinement in our 2024 development capital range is primarily related to the aforementioned delay of our Bowerman RNG Project. The majority of our 2024 development capital expenditures are related to our ongoing development of Montauk Ag Renewables, the second Apex facility, and the Bowerman RNG project. Our Amended Credit Agreement provides us with a 120,000 revolving credit facility, with a 75,000 accordion option, providing us with access to

additional capital to implement our acquisition and development strategy. We are currently in various stages of discussions regarding a variety of strategic growth opportunities. Included amongst these opportunities are: approximately up to three LFG RNG, waste-water treatment RNG, and CNG distribution opportunities. If we ultimately enter into definitive agreements for any of these opportunities, we expect to incur material capital expenditures related to either acquisition costs or development costs, or both. As we continue to explore strategic growth opportunities and while we have entered into nonbinding letters of intent for certain of these opportunities, we provide no assurances that our plans related to any or all of these strategic opportunities will progress to definitive agreements. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, and credit availability under our Amended Credit Agreement would allow us to pursue and close on our identified strategic growth opportunities in addition to the previously discussed non-development and development capital expenditures. 
 Cash Flow 
 The following table presents information regarding our cash flows and cash equivalents for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

For the first nine months of 2024, we generated 43,071 of cash provided by operating activities compared to 19,587 in the first nine months of 2023. For the first nine months of 2024, income and adjustments to income from operating activities provided 46,737 compared to income and adjustments to income provided 35,915 in first nine months of 2023. Working capital and other assets and liabilities used 3,666 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to working capital and other assets and liabilities used 16,328 in the first nine months of 2023. 
 Our net cash flows used in investing activities has historically focused on project development and facility maintenance. Our capital expenditures for the first nine months of 2024 were 53,334, of which 24,977, 10,021, 7,871, 1,795, and 1,297 were related to the Montauk Ag Renewables in North Carolina, second Apex RNG facility, Bowerman RNG project, Blue Granite RNG project, and the Pico facility digestion capacity increase, respectively. We completed a land acquisition in Turkey, NC for 42 acres during the first nine months of 2024 for 820. 
 Our net cash flows used in financing activities of 7,755 for the first nine months of 2024 increased by 1,701 compared to cash used in financing activities in the first nine months of 2023 of 6,054. 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 Off-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under GAAP. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are limited to the outstanding letters of credit described below. Although these arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes, we are not dependent on them to maintain our liquidity and capital resources, and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the off-balance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources. 
 We have contractual obligations involving asset retirement obligations. See Note 8 in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the asset retirement obligations. 
 We have contractual obligations under our debt agreement, including interest payments and principal repayments. See Note 12 in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the contractual commitments under our debt agreements, including the timing of principal repayments. During the first nine months of 2024, we had approximately 2,185 of off-balance sheet arrangements of outstanding letters of credit. These letters of credit reduce the borrowing capacity of our revolving credit facility under our Amended Credit Agreement. Certain of our contracts require these letters of credit to be issued to provide additional performance assurances. There have been no draw downs on these outstanding letters of credit. During the first nine months of 2023, we did not have off-balance sheet arrangements other than outstanding letters of credit of approximately 2,505.

We have contractual obligations involving operating leases. We lease office space and other office equipment under operating lease arrangements, expiring in various years through 2033. See Note 18 in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further information related to the lease obligations. 
 We have other contractual obligations associated with our fuel supply agreements. The expiration of these agreements range between 3-19 years. The minimum royalty and capital obligation associated with these agreements range from 8 to 1,645. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP and require our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and such estimates may change if the underlying conditions or assumptions change. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Our revenues are comprised of renewable energy and the related Environmental Attribute sales provided under a variety of short-term and medium-term agreements with our customers. All revenue is recognized when we satisfy our performance obligation(s) under the contract (either implicit or explicit) by transferring the promised product to the customer either when (or as) the customer obtains control of the product. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product or service to a customer. A contract s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation. We allocate the contract s transaction price to each performance obligation using the product s observable market standalone selling price for each distinct product in the contract. 
 Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring our products. As such, revenue is recorded net of allowances and customer discounts as well as net of transportation and gathering costs incurred. To the extent applicable, sales, value add, and other taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are accounted for on a net (excluded from revenues) basis. 
 The nature of the Company s contracts may give rise to several types of variable consideration, such as periodic price increases. This variable consideration is outside of the Company s influence as the variable consideration is dictated by the market. Therefore, the variable consideration associated with the long-term contracts is considered fully constrained. 
 RINs 
 We generate D3 RINs through our production and sale of RNG used for transportation purposes as prescribed under the RFS program. Our operating costs are associated with the production of RNG. The RINs are government incentives that are generated through our renewable operating projects and not a result of physical attributes of our RNG production. The RINs that we generate are able to be separated and sold as credits independently from the energy produced. Therefore, no cost is allocated to the RIN when it is generated. Revenue is recognized on these Environmental Attributes when there is an agreement in place to monetize the credits at an agreed upon price with a customer and transfer of control has occurred. We enter into forward commitments to transfer RINs. These forward commitments are based on D3 RIN index prices at the time of the commitment. Realized prices for RINs monetized in a year may not correspond directly to index prices due to the forward selling of commitments. 
 RECs 
 We generate RECs through our production and conversion of landfill methane into Renewable Electricity in various states, including California, Oklahoma, and Texas. These states have various laws requiring utilities to purchase a portion of their energy from renewable resources. Our operating costs are associated with the production of Renewable Electricity. The RECs are generated as an output of our renewable operating projects. The RECs that we generate are able to be separated and sold independently from the electricity produced. Therefore, no cost is allocated to the REC when it is generated. Revenue is recognized on these Environmental Attributes when there is an agreement in place to monetize the credits at an agreed upon price with a customer and transfer of control has occurred. 
 Income Taxes 
 We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and local jurisdictions. Tax regulations within each jurisdiction are subject to the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and require significant judgment to apply. 
 46 

Table of Contents 

Our net deferred tax asset position is a result of fixed assets, intangibles, and tax credit carryforwards. The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible, prior to the expiration of the tax attributes. The evaluation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns and forecasting future profitability by tax jurisdiction. 
 We evaluate our deferred tax assets at reporting periods on a jurisdictional basis to determine whether adjustments to the valuation allowance are appropriate considering changes in facts or circumstances. As of each reporting date, management considers new evidence, both positive and negative, when determining the future realization of our deferred tax assets. We account for uncertain tax positions using a more-likely-than-not threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions. The evaluation of uncertain tax positions is based on factors that include, but are not limited to, changes in tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, the effective settlement of matters subject to audit, new audit activity and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position. 
 Intangible Assets 
 Separately identifiable intangible assets are recorded at their fair values upon acquisition. We account for intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other . Finite-lived intangible assets include interconnections, customer contracts, and trade names and trademarks. The interconnection intangible asset is the exclusive right to utilize an interconnection line between the operating project and a utility substation to transmit produced electricity. Included in that right is full maintenance provided on this line by the utility. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. We evaluate our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment as events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be fully recoverable. Events that could result in an impairment include, among others, a significant decrease in the market price or the decision to close a site. 
 If finite-lived or indefinite-lived intangible assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. The fair value is determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows. We use our best estimates in making these evaluations, however, actual future pricing, operating costs and discount rates could vary from the assumptions used in our estimates and the impact of such variations could be material. 
 Our assessment of the recoverability of finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets is determined by performing monitoring assessment of the future cash flows associated with the underlying gas rights agreements. The cash flows estimates are performed at the operating unit level and based on the average remaining length of the gas rights agreements. Based on our analysis, we concluded the cashflows generated to be well in excess of the carrying amounts. Changes in market conditions related to the various price indexes used in estimating these cash flows could adversely affect these estimates. 
 Finite-Lived Asset Impairment 
 In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant and Equipment and intangible assets with finite useful lives are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Such estimates are based on certain assumptions, which are subject to uncertainty and may materially differ from actual results, including considering project specific assumptions for long-term credit prices, escalated future project operating costs and expected site operations. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Fair value is generally determined by considering (i) internally developed discounted cash flows for the asset group, (ii) third-party valuations, and/or (iii) information available regarding the current market value for such assets. We use our best estimates in making these evaluations and consider various factors, including future pricing and operating costs. However, actual future market prices and project costs could vary from the assumptions used in our estimates and the impact of such variations could be material. We identified discrete events and recorded impairment of 1,232 and 777 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. See Note 3 in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further information related to asset impairments. 
 Emerging Growth Company

61 [4855-2702-8147_1] 4855-2702-8147_4 

(c) If any Change in Law shall either (i) impose, modify or cause to be deemed applicable any reserve, special deposit, limitation or similar requirement against letters of credit issued or participated in by, or assets held by, or deposits in or for the account of, Issuing Lender or any Revolving Credit Lender or (ii) impose on Issuing Lender or any Revolving Credit Lender any other condition regarding this Agreement, the Letters of Credit or any participations in such Letters of Credit, and the result of any event referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above shall be to increase the cost or expense to Issuing Lender or such Revolving Credit Lender of issuing or maintaining or participating in any of the Letters of Credit (which increase in cost or expense shall be determined by the Issuing Lender s or such Revolving Credit Lender s reasonable allocation of the aggregate of such cost increases and expenses resulting from such events), then, upon demand by the Issuing Lender or such Revolving Credit Lender, as the case may be, the Borrower shall, within thirty (30) days following demand for payment, pay to Issuing Lender or such Revolving Credit Lender, as the case may be, from time to time as specified by the Issuing Lender or such Revolving Credit Lender, additional amounts which shall be sufficient to compensate the Issuing Lender or such Revolving Credit Lender for such increased cost and expense (together with interest on each such amount from ten days after the date such payment is due until payment in full thereof at the Base Rate), provided that if the Issuing Lender or such Revolving Credit Lender could take any reasonable action, without cost or administrative or other burden or restriction to such Lender, to mitigate or eliminate such cost or expense, it agrees to do so within a reasonable time after becoming aware of the foregoing matters.

62 [4855-2702-8147_1] 4855-2702-8147_4 

(B) If the Issuing Lender shall honor a draft or other demand for payment presented or made under any Letter of Credit, the Borrower agrees to pay to the Issuing Lender an amount equal to the amount paid by the Issuing Lender in respect of such draft or other demand under such Letter of Credit and all reasonable and invoiced out-of-pocket expenses paid or incurred by the Agent relative thereto not later than 1:00 p.m. (Detroit time), in Dollars, on (i) the Business Day that the Borrower received notice of such presentment and honor, if such notice is received prior to 11:00 a.m. (Detroit time) or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower received such notice, if such notice is received after 11:00 a.m. (Detroit time). 

(C) If the Issuing Lender shall honor a draft or other demand for payment presented or made under any Letter of Credit, but the Borrower does not reimburse the Issuing Lender as required under clause (b) above and the Revolving Credit Aggregate Commitment has not been terminated (whether by maturity, acceleration or otherwise), the Borrower shall be deemed to have immediately requested that the Revolving Credit Lenders make a Base Rate Advance of the Revolving Credit (which Advance may be subsequently converted at any time into a [BSBY Rate] Term SOFR Advance pursuant to Section 2.3 hereof) in the principal amount equal to the amount paid by the Issuing Lender in respect of such draft or other demand under such Letter of Credit and all reasonable and invoiced out-of-pocket expenses paid or incurred by the Agent relative thereto. The Agent will promptly notify the Revolving Credit Lenders of such deemed request, and each such Lender shall make available to the Agent an amount equal to its pro rata share (based on its Revolving Credit Percentage) of the amount of such Advance. 

(D) If the Issuing Lender shall honor a draft or other demand for payment presented or made under any Letter of Credit, but the Borrower does not reimburse the Issuing Lender as required under clause (b) above, and (i) the Revolving Credit Aggregate Commitment has been terminated (whether by maturity, acceleration or otherwise), or (ii) any reimbursement received by the Issuing Lender from the Borrower is or must be returned or rescinded upon or during any bankruptcy or reorganization of any Credit Party or otherwise, then the Agent shall notify each Revolving Credit Lender, and each Revolving Credit Lender will be obligated to pay the Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender its pro 

63 [4855-2702-8147_1] 4855-2702-8147_4 

rata share (based on its Revolving Credit Percentage) of the amount paid by the Issuing Lender in respect of such draft or other demand under such Letter of Credit and all reasonable and invoiced out-of-pocket expenses paid or incurred by the Agent relative thereto (but no such payment shall diminish the obligations of the Borrower hereunder). Upon receipt thereof, the Agent will deliver to such Revolving Credit Lender a participation certificate evidencing its participation interest in respect of such payment and expenses. To the extent that a Revolving Credit Lender fails to make such amount available to the Agent by 11:00 am Detroit time on the Business Day next succeeding the date such notice is given, such Revolving Credit Lender shall pay interest on such amount in respect of each day from the date such amount was required to be paid, to the date paid to the Agent, at the rate applicable under Section 2.4(c)(i) in respect of Revolving Credit Advances. The failure of any Revolving Credit Lender to make its pro rata portion of any such amount available under to the Agent shall not relieve any other Revolving Credit Lender of its obligation to make available its pro rata portion of such amount, but no Revolving Credit Lender shall be responsible for failure of any other Revolving Credit Lender to make such pro rata portion available to the Agent. 

(E) In the case of any Advance made under this Section 3.6, each such Advance shall be disbursed notwithstanding any failure to satisfy any conditions for disbursement of any Advance set forth in Article 2 hereof or Article 5 hereof, and, to the extent of the Advance so disbursed, the Reimbursement Obligation of the Borrower to the Agent under this Section 3.6 shall be deemed satisfied (unless, in each case, taking into account any such deemed Advances, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Advances of the Revolving Credit and the Swing Line, plus the Letter of Credit Obligations (other than the Reimbursement Obligations to be reimbursed by this Advance) on such date exceed the then applicable Revolving Credit Aggregate Commitment). 

(F) If the Issuing Lender shall honor a draft or other demand for payment presented or made under any Letter of Credit, the Issuing Lender shall provide notice thereof to the Borrower on the date such draft or demand is honored, and to each Revolving Credit Lender on such date unless the Borrower shall have satisfied its reimbursement obligations by payment to the Agent (for the benefit of the Issuing Lender) as required under this Section 3.6. The Issuing Lender shall 

64 [4855-2702-8147_1] 4855-2702-8147_4 

further use reasonable efforts to provide notice to the Borrower prior to honoring any such draft or other demand for payment, but such notice, or the failure to provide such notice, shall not affect the rights or obligations of the Issuing Lender with respect to any Letter of Credit or the rights and obligations of the parties hereto, including without limitation the obligations of the Borrower under this Section 3.6. 

(G) Notwithstanding the foregoing however no Revolving Credit Lender shall be deemed to have acquired a participation in a Letter of Credit if the officers of the Issuing Lender immediately responsible for matters concerning this Agreement shall have received written notice from the Agent or any Lender at least two (2) Business Days prior to the date of the issuance or extension of such Letter of Credit or, with respect to any Letter of Credit subject to automatic extension, at least five (5) Business Days prior to the date that the beneficiary under such Letter of Credit must be notified that such Letter of Credit will not be renewed, that the issuance or extension of Letters of Credit should be suspended based on the occurrence and continuance of a Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a notice of default provided, however that the Revolving Credit Lenders shall be deemed to have acquired such a participation upon the date on which such Default or Event of Default has been waived by the requisite Revolving Credit Lenders, as applicable. 

(H) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to require or authorize any Revolving Credit Lender to issue any Letter of Credit, it being recognized that the Issuing Lender shall be the sole issuer of Letters of Credit under this Agreement. 

(I) In the event that any Revolving Credit Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, the Issuing Lender may, at its option, require that the Borrower enter into arrangements satisfactory to Issuing Lender to eliminate the Fronting Exposure with respect to the participation in the Letter of Credit Obligations by such Defaulting Lender, including creation of a cash collateral account on terms satisfactory to the Agent or delivery of other security to assure payment of such Defaulting Lender s Percentage of all outstanding Letter of Credit Obligations.

 (e) Waiver of Defaults 

. No Event of Default shall be waived by the Lenders except in a writing signed by an officer of the Agent in accordance with Section 13.10 hereof.

 (f) Set Off 

. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, each Lender may at any time and from time to time, without notice to the Borrower but subject to the provisions of Section 10.3 hereof (any requirement for such notice being expressly waived by the Borrower), setoff and apply against any and all of the obligations of the Borrower now 
 113 [4855-2702-8147_1] 4855-2702-8147_4 

or hereafter existing under this Agreement, whether owing to such Lender, any Affiliate of such Lender or any other Lender or the Agent, any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower and any property of the Borrower from time to time in possession of such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such deposits held or indebtedness owing by such Lender may be contingent and unmatured and regardless of whether any Collateral then held by the Agent or any Lender is adequate to cover the Indebtedness. Promptly following any such setoff, such Lender shall give written notice to the Agent and the Borrower of the occurrence thereof; provided that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.4 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held for the benefit of the Agent, the Issuing Lender and the Lenders, and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Indebtedness owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff. The Borrower hereby grants to the Lenders and the Agent a lien on and security interest in all such deposits, indebtedness and property as collateral security for the payment and performance of all of the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. The rights of each Lender under this Section 9.6 are in addition to the other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have. 
 22. PAYMENTS, RECOVERIES AND COLLECTIONS. 

(a) Payment Generally. 

(a) All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise provided herein, all payments of principal, interest or fees hereunder shall be made by the Borrower to the Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, without setoff or counterclaim on the date specified for payment under this Agreement and must be received by the Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. (Detroit time) (or such later time on such date as agreed to by Agent) on the date such payment is required or intended to be made in Dollars in immediately available funds to the Agent at the Agent s Office. Any payment received by the Agent after 1:00 p.m. (Detroit time) (or such later time on such date as agreed to by Agent) shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. The Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its ratable share (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender s applicable lending office (or otherwise distribute such payment in like funds as received to the Person or Persons entitled thereto as provided herein). 

(b) Unless the Agent shall have been notified in writing by the Borrower at least two (2) Business Days prior to the date on which any payment to be made by the Borrower is due that the Borrower does not intend to remit such payment, the Agent may, in its sole discretion and without obligation to do so, assume that the Borrower has remitted such payment when so due and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to each Revolving Credit Lender or Term Loan Lender, as the case may be, on such payment date an amount equal to such Lender s 

114 [4855-2702-8147_1] 4855-2702-8147_4 

share of such assumed payment. If the Borrower has not in fact remitted such payment to the Agent, each Lender shall forthwith on demand repay to the Agent the amount of such assumed payment made available or transferred to such Lender, together with the interest thereon, in respect of each day from and including the date such amount was made available by the Agent to such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Agent at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation for the first two (2) Business Days that such amount remains unpaid, and thereafter at a rate of interest then applicable to such Revolving Credit Advances. 

(c) Subject to the definition of Interest Period in Section 1 of this Agreement, whenever any payment to be made hereunder shall otherwise be due on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and such extension of time shall be included in computing interest, if any, in connection with such payment; provided that, if such next succeeding Business Day would fall after any applicable Maturity Date, payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day. 

(d) The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Advances, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Advances, as applicable, and to make payments pursuant to Section 13.5 or otherwise hereunder are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Advance or, as applicable, to fund any such participation or to make any such payment on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its applicable Loan, to purchase its participations, as applicable, or to make any payment hereunder. 

(b) Application of Proceeds of Collateral 

. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the case of any Event of Default under Section 9.1(i), immediately following the occurrence thereof, and in the case of any other Event of Default: (a) upon the termination of the Revolving Credit Aggregate Commitment, (b) the acceleration of any Indebtedness arising under this Agreement, (c) at the Agent s option, or (d) upon the request of the Majority Lenders after the commencement of any remedies hereunder, the Agent shall apply the proceeds of any Collateral, together with any offsets, voluntary payments by any Credit Party or others and any other sums received or collected in respect of the Indebtedness first, to pay all incurred and unpaid fees and expenses of the Agent under the Loan Documents and any protective advances made by the Agent with respect to the Collateral under or pursuant to the terms of any Loan Document, next, to pay any fees and expenses owed to the Issuing Lender hereunder, next, to pay principal and interest due under the Revolving Credit (including the Swing Line and any Reimbursement Obligations) and the Term Loan, to cash collateralize all outstanding Letters of Credit in an amount equal to 105 of the maximum amount that may be available to be drawn at any time prior to the stated expiry of all outstanding Letters of Credit, and to pay any obligations owing by any Credit Party under any Hedging Agreements or with respect to any Lender Products on a pro rata basis, next, to pay any other Indebtedness on a pro rata basis, and then, if there is any excess, to the Credit Parties, as the case may be. 
 (c) Pro-rata Recovery 

115 [4855-2702-8147_1] 4855-2702-8147_4 

. If any Lender shall obtain any payment or other recovery (whether voluntary, involuntary, by application of setoff or otherwise) on account of principal of, or interest on, any of the Advances made by it, or the participations in Letter of Credit Obligations or Swing Line Advances held by it in excess of its pro rata share of payments then or thereafter obtained by all Lenders upon principal of and interest on all such Indebtedness, such Lender shall purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Revolving Credit, the Term Loan, and/or the Letter of Credit Obligation held by them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment or other recovery ratably in accordance with the applicable Percentages of the Lenders; provided, however, that if all or any portion of the excess payment or other recovery is thereafter recovered from such purchasing holder, the purchase shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. 
 (d) Treatment of a Defaulting Lender; Reallocation of Defaulting Lender s Fronting Exposure. 

(A) The obligation of any Lender to make any Advance hereunder shall not be affected by the failure of any other Lender to make any Advance under this Agreement, and no Lender shall have any liability to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, the Agent, any other Lender, or any other Person for another Lender s failure to make any loan or Advance hereunder. 

(B) If any Lender shall become a Defaulting Lender, then such Defaulting Lender s right to vote in respect of any amendment, consent or waiver of the terms of this Agreement or such other Loan Documents, or to direct or approve any action or inaction by the Agent shall be subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 13.10. 

(C) Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article 9 or otherwise) or received by the Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 9.6 shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Agent as follows: first , to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Agent hereunder; second , to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to any Issuing Lender or Swing Line Lender hereunder; third , to cash collateralize the Issuing Lenders Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender in accordance with clause (g) below; fourth , as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Advance in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion 

116 [4855-2702-8147_1] 4855-2702-8147_4 

thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Agent; fifth , if so determined by the Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to (x) satisfy such Defaulting Lender s potential future funding obligations with respect to Advances under this Agreement and (y) cash collateralize the Issuing Lenders future Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement, in accordance with clause (g) below; sixth , to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders, the Issuing Lenders or Swing Line Lenders as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, the Issuing Lenders or Swing Line Lenders against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; seventh , so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and eighth , to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Advances or Letter of Credit Obligations in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Advances were made or the related Letters of Credit were issued at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.2 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Advances of, and Letter of Credit Obligations to, all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Advances of, or Letter of Credit Obligations owed to, such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Advances and funded and unfunded participations in Letter of Credit Obligations and Swing Line Advances are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with their respective Revolving Credit Percentages without giving effect to Section clause (d) below. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post cash collateral pursuant to this clause (c) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto. 

(D) No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any Revolving Credit Facility Fee for any period during which 

117 [4855-2702-8147_1] 4855-2702-8147_4 

that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender). 

(E) Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive the Letter of Credit Fees described in Section 3.4(a) for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to its Revolving Credit Percentage of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided cash collateral in accordance with clause (g) below). With respect to any Revolving Credit Facility Fee or Letter of Credit Fee not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (A) or (B) above, the Borrower shall (x) pay to each Non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lender s participation in Letter of Credit Obligations or Swing Line Advances that has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause f below, (y) pay to each Issuing Lender and Swing Line Lender, as applicable, the amount of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to such Issuing Lender s and Swing Line Lender s Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender, and (z) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee. 

(F) If any Lender shall become a Defaulting Lender, then, for so long as such Lender remains a Defaulting Lender, any Fronting Exposure shall be reallocated by the Agent at the request of the Swing Line Lender and/or the Issuing Lender among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Percentages of the Revolving Credit, but only to the extent that the sum of the aggregate principal amount of all Revolving Credit Advances made by each Non-Defaulting Lender, plus such Non-Defaulting Lender s Percentage of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Swing Line Advances and Letter of Credit Obligations prior to giving effect to such reallocation plus such Non-Defaulting Lender s Percentage of the Fronting Exposure to be reallocated does not exceed such Non- Defaulting Lender s Percentage of the Revolving Credit Aggregate Commitment, and only so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing on the date of such reallocation. 

(G) At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, within one (1) Business Day following the written request of the 

118 [4855-2702-8147_1] 4855-2702-8147_4

(b) To the extent permitted by applicable law, each Lender agrees not to assert any right or claim to any Erroneous Payment (or any portion thereof) and hereby waives any claim, counterclaim, defense or right of set-off or recoupment with respect to any demand, claim or counterclaim by the Agent for the return of any Erroneous Payment (or any portion thereof) (including, without limitation, any defense based on discharge for value or any similar doctrine). 

(c) This Section 10.5 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Agent, any transfer of rights or obligations by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and/or the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) under any Loan Document.

(a) the Agent [shall determine] determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) [or, in the case of clause (b) below, the Majority Lenders shall determine (which determinations shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) and notify Agent, that:] 

(a) that Term SOFR [the Benchmark (] or any component thereof) cannot be determined pursuant to the definition thereof, or 
 (b) the [Benchmark for such Interest Period or other applicable tenor (collectively, the Affected Tenor )] Majority Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a Term SOFR Advance or a conversion thereto or a continuation thereof that Adjusted Term SOFR for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Term SOFR Advance does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding [or maintaining ] such Advance, [or] and the Majority Lenders have provided notice of such determination to the Agent, 

(c) [the making or funding of any Advance that accrues interest at or by reference to the Benchmark has become impracticable or not administratively feasible, ] the Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. 
 
 Upon notice thereof by the Agent to the Borrower, (i) any obligation of the Lenders to make Term SOFR Advances [ that accrue interest at or by reference to such Benchmark] , and any right of the Borrower to continue Term SOFR Advances [that accrue interest at or by reference to such Benchmark, ] or to convert Base 
 120 [4855-2702-8147_1] 4855-2702-8147_4 

Rate Advances to Term SOFR Advances [ that accrue interest at or by reference to such Benchmark] , shall be suspended [in each case, ] to the extent of the affected Term SOFR Advances or [Affected Tenors] affected Interest Periods until the Agent (with respect to clause (b) of this Section [11.2] 11.3 , at the instruction of the Majority Lenders) revokes such notice, (ii) the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of [any] Term SOFR Advances [that accrue interest at or by reference to such Benchmark ] (to the extent of the affected Term SOFR Advances or [Affected Tenors] affected Interest Periods or, failing that, the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Advances in the amount specified therein and (iii) any outstanding affected Term SOFR Advances will be deemed to have been converted into Base Rate Advances at the end of the applicable Interest Period [ or other applicable tenor] . Upon any such conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 11.1. Subject to Section [11.3,] 11.11 if the Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that [the Benchmark] Term SOFR (or any component thereof) cannot be determined pursuant to the definition thereof on any given day, the interest rate on Base Rate Advances shall be determined by the Agent without reference to clause (c) of the definition of Base Rate until the Agent revokes such determination. 
 11.3 [BSBY Unavailability; Successor Rate Determination] [. ] 
 (a) [Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Documents, but without limiting Section 11.2 above, if:] 
 (i) [adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining all Available Tenors of the BSBY Rate (including, without limitation, because the BSBY Screen Rate is not available or published on a current basis), and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary, as determined by the Agent (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error), or Majority Lenders pursuant to, in the case of the Majority Lenders, delivery of notice to the Agent with a copy to the Borrower that Majority Lenders have so determined (which determination likewise shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error); or] 
 (ii) [the BSBY Administrator or a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Agent or the BSBY Administrator with respect to its publication of BSBY, in each case acting in such capacity, has made a public statement (A) identifying a specific date after which all Available Tenors of the BSBY Rate shall or will no longer be representative or made available, or permitted to be used for determining the interest rate of Dollar denominated syndicated loans, or shall or will otherwise cease, provided that, at the time of such statement, there is no 
 121 [4855-2702-8147_1] 4855-2702-8147_4 

successor administrator that is satisfactory to the Agent, that will continue to provide such interest periods of the BSBY Rate after the latest date on which all Available Tenors of the BSBY Rate (or any component thereof) are no longer representative or available permanently or indefinitely, or (B) that the BSBY Rate (or any component thereof) fails to comply with the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) Principles for Financial Benchmarks; or] 
 (iii) [all Available Tenors of BSBY are not newly published (e.g., are carried over) by the BSBY Administrator for five (5) consecutive Business Days and such failure is not the result of a temporary moratorium, embargo, or disruption declared by the BSBY Administrator or by the regulatory supervisor for the BSBY Administrator; ] 
 (iv) [then, on a date and time determined by the Agent (any such date, a Replacement Date ), which date shall be at the end of an Interest Period or on the relevant Interest Payment Date, as applicable, for interest calculated and, solely with respect to clause (ii) above, no later than the latest date determined under clause (ii), the BSBY Rate will be replaced hereunder and under any Loan Document with the first available alternative set forth in the order below for any payment period for interest calculated that can be determined by the Agent, in each case, without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document (such rate, and any subsequent successor rate so determined, the Successor Rate ):] 
 [(x) 	 Term SOFR plus the SOFR Adjustment; and] 
 [(y) 	 Daily Simple SOFR plus the SOFR Adjustment.] 
 [In the event that the Successor Rate is Daily Simple SOFR plus the SOFR Adjustment, all interest payments will be payable on a monthly basis.] 
 (b) [Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) if the Agent determines that neither of the alternatives set forth in clauses (x) and (y) of Section 11.3(a) above is available on or prior to the Replacement Date or (ii) if events or circumstances comparable to those described in Section 11.3(a)(i) or Section 11.3(a)(ii) have occurred with respect to the Successor Rate then in effect, then in each case, the Agent and the Borrower may amend this Agreement solely for the purpose of replacing the BSBY Rate or any then current Successor Rate in accordance with this Section 11.3 at the end of any Interest Period or other applicable tenor, relevant Interest Payment Date or payment 
 122 [4855-2702-8147_1] 4855-2702-8147_4 

period for interest calculated, as applicable, with another alternate benchmark rate giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar U.S. dollar denominated syndicated credit facilities for such alternative benchmark rate and, in each case, including any mathematical or other adjustments to such benchmark rate giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar U.S. dollar denominated syndicated credit facilities for such benchmark rate, which adjustment or method for calculating such adjustment shall be published on an information service as selected by the Agent from time to time in its reasonable discretion and may be periodically updated. For the avoidance of doubt, any such proposed rate and adjustments shall constitute a Successor Rate . Any such amendment shall become effective at 5:00 p.m. on the fifth Business Day after the Agent shall have posted such proposed amendment to all Lenders and the Borrower unless, prior to such time, Lenders comprising the Majority Lenders have delivered to the Agent written notice that such Majority Lenders object to such amendment.] 
 [The Agent will promptly (in one or more notices) notify the Borrower and each Lender of the implementation of any Successor Rate. Any Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner consistent with market practice; provided that to the extent such market practice is not administratively feasible for the Agent, such Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner as otherwise reasonably determined by the Agent. In connection with the implementation of any Successor Rate, the Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement; provided that, with respect to any such amendment effected, the Agent shall post each such amendment implementing such Conforming Changes to the Borrower and the Lenders reasonably promptly after such amendment becomes effective.] 
 [Notwithstanding anything else herein, if at any time any Successor Rate as so determined would otherwise be less than the Applicable Floor, the Successor Rate will be deemed to be the Applicable Floor for the purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.] 
 (c) [Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of this Section 11.3), (i) if the BSBY Rate or the then-current Successor Rate is a term rate (including Term SOFR) and either (A) any tenor for such benchmark rate is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the Agent in its reasonable discretion, or (B) the administrator of such benchmark rate or the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such benchmark rate has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for 
 123 [4855-2702-8147_1] 4855-2702-8147_4 

such benchmark rate is not or will not be representative or in compliance with or aligned with the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) Principles for Financial Benchmarks, then the Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period (or any similar or analogous definition) for any benchmark rate settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable, non-representative, non-compliant or non-aligned tenor and (ii) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (i) above either (A) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a benchmark rate (including any Successor Rate), or (B) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is not or will not be representative or in compliance with or aligned with the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) Principles for Financial Benchmarks for a Benchmark (including any Successor Rate), then the Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period (or any similar or analogous definition) for all benchmark rate settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor.] 
 (d) Illegality. If any Lender determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding , absent manifest error) that any applicable law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that (i) it is unlawful, (ii) it would create safety and soundness risks, or (iii) it would not be consistent with sound banking practices, for any Lender or its applicable lending office to make, maintain or fund Advances whose interest is determined by reference to SOFR, the [BSBY] Term SOFR Reference Rate, Adjusted Term SOFR or Term SOFR, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon SOFR, the [BSBY] Term SOFR Reference Rate , Adjusted Term SOFR or Term SOFR , then, upon notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower (through the Agent), (a) any obligation of the Lenders to make [BSBY Rate] Term SOFR Advances, and any right of the Borrower to continue [BSBY Rate] Term SOFR Advances or to convert Base Rate Advances to [BSBY Rate] Term SOFR Advances, shall be suspended, (b) the interest rate on Base Rate Advances shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Agent without reference to clause (c) of the definition of Base Rate , in each case until such Lender notifies the Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist and (c) the Borrower shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, upon demand from any Lender (with a copy to the Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all [BSBY Rate] Term SOFR Advances to Base Rate Advances (subject to clause (b) of this Section 11.4) on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if [all] such affected [Lenders] Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such [BSBY Rate] Term SOFR Advances to such day, or immediately, if [any] such affected Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such [BSBY Rate] Term SOFR Advances to such day. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 11.1. 

(e) Increased Costs. If any Change in Law shall: 

124 [4855-2702-8147_1] 4855-2702-8147_4 

(a) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve (including pursuant to regulations issued from time to time by the Federal Reserve Board for determining the maximum reserve requirement (including any emergency, special, supplemental or other marginal reserve requirement) with respect to eurocurrency funding (currently referred to as Eurocurrency liabilities in Regulation D)), special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender; or 

(b) subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or 

(c) impose on any Lender any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Advances made by such Lender; and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Recipient of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Advance or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Advance, or to increase the cost to such Lender, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or other Recipient hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or other Recipient, the Borrower will pay to such Lender or other Recipient, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or other Recipient, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. 

(f) Capital Requirements. If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any lending office of such Lender or such Lender s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s capital or on the capital of such Lender s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Advances made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender s policies and the policies of such Lender s holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender s holding company for any such reduction suffered. 

(g) Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in Section 11.5 or 11.6 of this Section, as well as the basis for determining such amounts, and delivered to the Borrower, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days after receipt thereof. 

(h) Margin Adjustment. Adjustments to the Applicable Margins and the Applicable Fee Percentages, based on Annex I, shall be implemented on a quarterly basis as follows: 

125 [4855-2702-8147_1] 4855-2702-8147_4 

(a) Such adjustments shall be given prospective effect only, effective as to all Advances outstanding hereunder, the Applicable Fee Percentage and the Letter of Credit Fee, upon the date of delivery of the financial statements under Sections 7.1(a) and 7.1(b) hereunder and the Covenant Compliance Report under Section 7.2(a) hereof, in each case establishing applicability of the appropriate adjustment and in each case with no retroactivity or claw-back. In the event the Borrower shall fail timely to deliver such financial statements or the Covenant Compliance Report and such failure continues for three (3) days, then (but without affecting the Event of Default resulting therefrom) from the date delivery of such financial statements and report was required until such financial statements and report are delivered, the Applicable Margins and Applicable Fee Percentages shall be at the highest level on the Pricing Matrix attached to this Agreement as Annex I. 

(b) From the Effective Date until the required date of delivery (or, if earlier, delivery) of the financial statements under Section 7.1(a) or 7.1(b) hereof, as applicable, and the Covenant Compliance Report under Section 7.2(a) hereof, for the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2019, the Applicable Margins and Applicable Fee Percentages shall be those set forth under the Level II column of the pricing matrix attached to this Agreement as Annex I. Thereafter, Applicable Margins and Applicable Fee Percentages shall be based upon the quarterly financial statements and Covenant Compliance Reports, subject to recalculation as provided in Section 11.8(a) above. 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, if, prior to the payment and discharge in full (in cash) of the Indebtedness and the termination of any and all commitments hereunder, as a result of any restatement of or adjustment to the financial statements of Borrower and any of its Subsidiaries (relating to the current or any prior fiscal period) or for any other reason, the Agent determines that the Applicable Margin and/or the Applicable Fee Percentages as calculated by the Borrower as of any applicable date of determination were inaccurate in any respect and a proper calculation thereof would have resulted in different pricing for any fiscal period, then (x) if the proper calculation thereof would have resulted in higher pricing for any such period, the Borrower shall automatically and retroactively be obligated to pay to the Agent, promptly upon demand by the Agent or the Majority Lenders, (or, after the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to Borrower under any Debtor Relief Laws, automatically and without further action by the Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Lender) an amount equal to the excess of the amount of interest and fees that should have been paid for such period over the amount of interest and fees actually paid for such period and, if the current fiscal period is affected thereby, the Applicable Margin and/or the Applicable Fee Percentages for the current period shall be adjusted based on such recalculation; and (y) if the proper calculation thereof would have resulted in lower pricing for such period, the Agent and Lenders shall have no obligation to recalculate such interest or fees or to repay any interest or fees to the Borrower. 

(i) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing Lender to demand compensation pursuant to Sections 11.5, 11.6 or 3.4 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender s or the Issuing Lender s right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the Issuing Lender pursuant to Sections 11.4, 11.5, 11.6 or 3.4(c), for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law (provided that this provision will not apply to any Change in 

126 [4855-2702-8147_1] 4855-2702-8147_4 

Law of the type referred to in clauses (x), (y) or (z) of the definition thereof) giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender s or the Issuing Lender s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180 day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). 

(j) [[Reserved]] Taxes . 

11.11 [Taxes] [. ] 
 (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Credit Party under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law. If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Credit Party shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made. 

(b) The Credit Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Agent, timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes. 

(c) As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by any Credit Party to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section [11.11] 11.10 , such Credit Party shall deliver to the Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Agent. 

(d) If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section [11.11] 11.10 , (including by payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section [11.11] 11.10 ), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund or indemnification (but only to the extent of additional amounts or indemnification paid under this Section [11.11] 11.10 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (d) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (d), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party 

127 [4855-2702-8147_1] 4855-2702-8147_4 

pursuant to this paragraph (d) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted or withheld and the additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person. 

(e) The Borrower shall indemnify each Lender, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by such Person or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Person and any reasonable and invoiced out-of-pocket expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Agent) or by the Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 

(f) Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Agent, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent the Borrower has not already indemnified the Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 13.8 hereof relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable and invoiced out-of-pocket expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest effort. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Agent under this paragraph (f). 

(g) For purposes of this Section [11.11] 11.10 , the term Lender includes any Issuing Lender and the term applicable law includes FATCA. 

(h) Each party s obligations under this Section [11.11] 11.10 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of a Lender, the termination of Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document. 

(k) Benchmark Replacement Setting. 

(a) Benchmark Replacement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, if a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior to any setting of the then-current Benchmark, then (x) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in 

128 [4855-2702-8147_1] 4855-2702-8147_4 

accordance with clause (a) of the definition of Benchmark Replacement for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document and (y) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (b) of the definition of Benchmark Replacement for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any other Loan Document in respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 5:00 p.m. (Detroit time) on the fifth (5 th Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document so long as the Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the Majority Lenders. 

(b) Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes. In connection with the use, administration, adoption or implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, the Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document. 

(c) Notices; Standards for Decisions and Determinations. The Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of (i) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement and (ii) the effectiveness of any Conforming Changes in connection with the use, administration, adoption or implementation of a Benchmark Replacement. The Agent will promptly notify the Borrower of the removal or reinstatement of any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to Section 11.11(d). Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Agent or, if applicable, any Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this Section 11.11, including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 11.11. 

(d) Unavailability of Tenor of Benchmark. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including the Term SOFR Reference Rate) and either (A) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the Agent in its reasonable discretion or (B) the administrator of such Benchmark or the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public 

129 [4855-2702-8147_1] 4855-2702-8147_4 

statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is not or will not be representative or in compliance with or aligned with the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) Principles for Financial Benchmarks, then the Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period (or any similar or analogous definition) for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable, non-representative, non-compliant or non-aligned tenor and (ii) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (i) above either (A) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is not or will not be representative or in compliance with or aligned with the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) Principles for Financial Benchmarks for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period (or any similar or analogous definition) for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor. 

(e) Benchmark Unavailability Period. Upon the Borrower s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Term SOFR Advance of, conversion to or continuation of Term SOFR Advances to be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for an advance of or conversion to Base Rate Advances. During a Benchmark Unavailability Period or at any time that a tenor for the then-current Benchmark is not an Available Tenor, the component of the Base Rate based upon the then-current Benchmark or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any determination of the Base Rate.

If the Agent at any time shall resign or if the office of the Agent shall become vacant for any other reason, Majority Lenders shall, by written instrument, appoint successor agent(s) Successor Agent satisfactory to such Majority Lenders and, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to the Borrower (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, however that any such successor Agent shall be a bank or a trust company or other financial institution which maintains an office in the United States, or a commercial bank organized under the laws of the United States or any state thereof, or any Affiliate of such bank or trust company or other financial institution which is engaged in the banking business, and shall have a combined capital and surplus of at least 500,000,000. Such Successor Agent shall thereupon become the Agent hereunder, as applicable, and the Agent shall deliver or cause to be delivered to any successor agent such documents of transfer and assignment as such 
 131 [4855-2702-8147_1] 4855-2702-8147_4 

Successor Agent may reasonably request. If a Successor Agent is not so appointed or does not accept such appointment before the resigning Agent s resignation becomes effective, the resigning Agent may appoint a temporary successor to act until such appointment by the Majority Lenders and, if applicable, the Borrower, is made and accepted, or if no such temporary successor is appointed as provided above by the resigning the Agent, the Majority Lenders shall thereafter perform all of the duties of the resigning the Agent hereunder until such appointment by the Majority Lenders and, if applicable, the Borrower, is made and accepted. Such Successor Agent shall succeed to all of the rights and obligations of the resigning Agent as if originally named. The resigning Agent shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such Successor Agent all moneys at the time held by the resigning Agent hereunder after deducting therefrom its expenses for which it is entitled to be reimbursed hereunder. Upon such succession of any such Successor Agent, the resigning Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations, in its capacity as the Agent hereunder, except for its gross negligence or willful misconduct arising prior to its resignation hereunder, and the provisions of this Article 12 shall continue in effect for the benefit of the resigning Agent in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Agent. 
 (e) Credit Decisions 

. Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently of the Agent and each other Lender and based on the financial statements of the Borrower and such other documents, information and investigations as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit decision to extend credit hereunder from time to time. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently of the Agent and each other Lender and based on such other documents, information and investigations as it shall deem appropriate at any time, continue to make its own credit decisions as to exercising or not exercising from time to time any rights and privileges available to it under this Agreement, any Loan Document or any other document executed pursuant hereto. 
 (f) Authority of the Agent to Enforce This Agreement 

. Each Lender, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, grants the Agent full power and authority as attorney-in-fact to institute and maintain actions, suits or proceedings for the collection and enforcement of any Indebtedness outstanding under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and to file such proofs of debt or other documents as may be necessary to have the claims of the Lenders allowed in any proceeding relative to any Credit Party, or their respective creditors or affecting their respective properties, and to take such other actions which the Agent considers to be necessary or desirable for the protection, collection and enforcement of the Notes, this Agreement or the other Loan Documents. 
 (g) Indemnification of the Agent 

. The Lenders agree to indemnify the Agent and its Affiliates (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower, but without limiting any obligation of the Borrower to make such reimbursement), ratably according to their respective Weighted Percentages, from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses of any kind or nature 
 132 [4855-2702-8147_1] 4855-2702-8147_4 

whatsoever (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of house and outside counsel) which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Agent and its Affiliates in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or any action taken or omitted by the Agent and its Affiliates under this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents; provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses resulting from the Agent s or its Affiliate s gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse the Agent and its Affiliates promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of house and outside counsel) incurred by the Agent and its Affiliates in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, to the extent that the Agent and its Affiliates are not reimbursed for such expenses by the Borrower, but without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to make such reimbursement. Each Lender agrees to reimburse the Agent and its Affiliates promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any amounts owing to the Agent and its Affiliates by the Lenders pursuant to this Section, provided that, if the Agent or its Affiliates are subsequently reimbursed by the Borrower for such amounts, they shall refund to the Lenders on a pro rata basis the amount of any excess reimbursement. If the indemnity furnished to the Agent and its Affiliates under this Section shall become impaired as determined in the Agent s reasonable judgment or the Agent shall elect in its sole discretion to have such indemnity confirmed by the Lenders (as to specific matters or otherwise), the Agent shall give notice thereof to each Lender and, until such additional indemnity is provided or such existing indemnity is confirmed, the Agent may cease, or not commence, to take any action. Any amounts paid by the Lenders hereunder to the Agent or its Affiliates shall be deemed to constitute part of the Indebtedness hereunder. 
 (h) Knowledge of Default 

. It is expressly understood and agreed that the Agent shall be entitled to assume that no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, unless the officers of the Agent immediately responsible for matters concerning this Agreement shall have received a written notice from a Lender or the Borrower specifying such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a notice of default . Upon receiving such a notice, the Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of such Default or Event of Default and provide each Lender with a copy of such notice and shall endeavor to provide such notice to the Lenders within three (3) Business Days (but without any liability whatsoever in the event of its failure to do so).

 (i) The Agent s Authorization; Action by Lenders

Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, whenever the Agent is authorized and empowered hereunder on behalf of the Lenders to give any approval or consent, or to make any request, or to take any other action on behalf of the Lenders (including without limitation the exercise of any right or remedy hereunder or under the other Loan Documents), 
 133 [4855-2702-8147_1] 4855-2702-8147_4 

the Agent shall be required to give such approval or consent, or to make such request or to take such other action only when so requested in writing by the Majority Lenders or the Lenders, as applicable hereunder. Action that may be taken by the Majority Lenders, any other specified Percentage of the Lenders or all of the Lenders, as the case may be (as provided for hereunder) may be taken (i) pursuant to a vote of the requisite percentages of the Lenders as required hereunder at a meeting (which may be held by telephone conference call), provided that the Agent exercises good faith, diligent efforts to give all of the Lenders reasonable advance notice of the meeting, or (ii) pursuant to the written consent of the requisite percentages of the Lenders as required hereunder, provided that all of the Lenders are given reasonable advance notice of the requests for such consent. 
 (j) Enforcement Actions by the Agent 

. Except as otherwise expressly provided under this Agreement or in any of the other Loan Documents and subject to the terms hereof, the Agent will take such action, assert such rights and pursue such remedies under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as the Majority Lenders or all of the Lenders, as the case may be (as provided for hereunder), shall direct; provided, however, that the Agent shall not be required to act or omit to act if, in the reasonable judgment of the Agent, such action or omission may expose the Agent to personal liability for which the Agent has not been satisfactorily indemnified hereunder or is contrary to this Agreement, any of the Loan Documents or applicable law. Except as expressly provided above or elsewhere in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, no Lender (other than the Agent, acting in its capacity as agent) shall be entitled to take any enforcement action of any kind under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents. 
 (k) Collateral Matters. 

(A) The Agent is authorized on behalf of all the Lenders, without the necessity of any notice to or further consent from the Lenders, from time to time to take any action with respect to any Collateral or the Collateral Documents which may be necessary to perfect and maintain a perfected security interest in and Liens upon the Collateral granted pursuant to the Loan Documents. 

(B) The Lenders irrevocably authorize the Agent, in its reasonable discretion, to the full extent set forth in Section 13.10(d) hereof, (1) to release or terminate any Lien granted to or held by the Agent upon any Collateral (a) upon the Payment in Full of all Indebtedness; (b) constituting property (including, without limitation, Equity Interests in any Person) sold or to be sold or disposed of as part of or in connection with any disposition (whether by sale, by merger or by any other form of transaction and including the property of any Subsidiary that is disposed of as permitted hereby) permitted in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; (c) constituting property in which a Credit Party 

134 [4855-2702-8147_1] 4855-2702-8147_4 

owned no interest at the time the Lien was granted or at any time thereafter; or (d) if approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Majority Lenders, or all the Lenders, as the case may be, as provided in Section 13.10; (2) to subordinate the Lien granted to or held by the Agent on any Collateral to any other holder of a Lien on such Collateral which is permitted by Section 8.2(b) hereof; and (3) if all of the Equity Interests held by the Credit Parties in any Person are sold or otherwise transferred to any transferee other than the Borrower or a Subsidiary of the Borrower as part of or in connection with any disposition (whether by sale, by merger or by any other form of transaction) permitted in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, to release such Person from all of its obligations under the Loan Documents (including, without limitation, under any Guaranty). Upon request by the Agent at any time, the Lenders will confirm in writing the Agent s authority to release particular types or items of Collateral pursuant to this Section 12.11(b). 

(l) The Agents in their Individual Capacities 

. Comerica Bank and its Affiliates, successors and assigns shall each have the same rights and powers hereunder as any other Lender and may exercise or refrain from exercising the same as though such Lender were not the Agent. Comerica Bank and its Affiliates may (without having to account therefor to any Lender) accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory or other business with the Credit Parties as if such Lender were not acting as the Agent hereunder, and may accept fees and other consideration therefor without having to account for the same to the Lenders. 
 (m) The Agent s Fees 

. Until the Indebtedness has been repaid and discharged in full and no commitment to extend any credit hereunder is outstanding, the Borrower shall pay to the Agent, as applicable, any agency or other fee(s) set forth (or to be set forth from time to time) in the applicable Fee Letter on the terms set forth therein. The agency fees referred to in this Section 12.13 shall not be refundable under any circumstances.

Any Lender identified on the facing page or signature page of this Agreement or in any amendment hereto or as designated with consent of the Agent in any assignment agreement as Lead Arranger, Documentation Agent, Syndications Agent or any similar titles, shall not have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement as a result of such title other than those applicable to all Lenders as such. Without limiting the foregoing, the Lenders so identified shall not have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender as a result of such title. Each Lender acknowledges 
 135 [4855-2702-8147_1] 4855-2702-8147_4 

that it has not relied, and will not rely, on the Lender so identified in deciding to enter into this Agreement or in taking or not taking action hereunder.

Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints, designates and authorizes Agent to enter into any subordination or intercreditor agreement pertaining to any Subordinated Debt, on its behalf and to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of any such agreement (subject to the last sentence of this Section 12.15). Each Lender further agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of each subordination or intercreditor agreement pertaining to any Subordinated Debt. Each Lender hereby authorizes Agent to issue blockages notices in connection with any Subordinated Debt at the direction of Majority Lenders (it being agreed and understood that Agent will not act unilaterally to issue such blockage notices). 
 (p) Indebtedness in respect of Lender Products and Hedging Agreements 

. Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, no Lender that obtains the benefits of the provisions of Section 10.2, any Guaranty or any Collateral by virtue of the provisions hereof or of any Guaranty or any Collateral Document shall have any right to notice of any action or to consent to, direct or object to any action hereunder or under any other Loan Document or otherwise in respect of the Collateral (including the release or impairment of any Collateral) (or to notice of or to consent to any amendment, waiver or modification of the provisions hereof or of the Guaranty or any Collateral Document) other than in its capacity as a Lender and, in such case, only to the extent expressly provided in the Loan Documents. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article 12 to the contrary, the Agent shall not be required to verify the payment of, or that other satisfactory arrangements have been made with respect to, Indebtedness arising under Lender Products and Hedging Agreements unless the Agent has received written notice of such Indebtedness, together with such supporting documentation as the Agent may request, from the applicable Lender. 
 (q) No Reliance on the Agent s Customer Identification Program. 

. 
 (A) Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that neither such Lender, nor any of its Affiliates, participants or assignees, may rely on the Agent to carry out such Lender s, Affiliate s, participant s or assignee s customer identification program, or other obligations required or imposed under or pursuant to the USA Patriot Act or the regulations thereunder, including the regulations contained in 31 CFR 103.121 (as hereafter amended or replaced, the CIP Regulations ), or any other Anti-Terrorism Law, including any programs involving any of the following items relating to or in connection with the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, any of their respective Affiliates or agents, the Loan Documents or the transactions hereunder: (i) any identify verification

(r) Flood Laws. Comerica Bank has adopted internal policies and procedures that address requirements placed on federally regulated lenders under the Flood Laws. Comerica Bank, as administrative agent or collateral agent on a syndicated facility, will post on the applicable electronic platform (or otherwise distribute to each Lender in the syndicate) documents that it receives in connection with the Flood Laws. However, Comerica Bank reminds each Lender and each participant in the facility that, pursuant to the Flood Laws, each federally regulated Lender (whether acting as a Lender or participant in the facility) is responsible for assuring its own compliance with the flood insurance requirements. 

(s) Lenders Representations and Certain Other Obligations .

Until the Assignment Agreement becomes effective in accordance with its terms and is recorded in the Register maintained by the Agent under clause (h) of this Section 13.8, and the Agent has confirmed that the assignment satisfies the requirements of this Section 13.8, the Borrower and the Agent shall be entitled to continue to deal solely and directly with the assigning Lender in connection with the interest so assigned. From and after the effective date of each Assignment Agreement that satisfies the requirements of this Section 13.8, the assignee thereunder shall be deemed to be a party to this Agreement, such assignee shall have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including without limitation the right to receive fees payable hereunder in respect of the period following such assignment) and the assigning Lender shall relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

(5) a participant shall not reassign or transfer, or grant any sub-participations in its participation interest hereunder or any part thereof; 

(6) such Lender shall retain the sole right and responsibility to enforce the obligations of the Credit Parties relating to the Notes and the other Loan Documents, including, without limitation, the right to proceed against any Guarantors, or cause the Agent to do so (subject to the terms and conditions hereof), and the right to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement without the consent of the participant (unless such participant is an Affiliate of such Lender), except for those matters requiring the consent of each of the Lenders under Section 13.10(b) (provided that a participant may exercise approval rights over such matters only on an indirect basis, acting through such Lender and the Credit Parties, the Agent and the other Lenders may continue to deal directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender s rights and duties hereunder). Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, in the case of any participation granted by any Lender hereunder, the participant shall not have any rights under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents against the Agent, any other Lender or any Credit Party; provided, however that the participant may have rights against such Lender in respect of such participation as may be set forth in the applicable participation agreement and all amounts payable by the Credit Parties hereunder shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participation. Each such participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Article 11 of this Agreement to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to clause (d) of this Section, provided that no participant shall be entitled to receive any greater amount pursuant to such the provisions of Article 11 than the issuing Lender would have been entitled to receive in respect of the amount of the participation transferred by such issuing Lender to such participant had no such transfer occurred and each such participant shall also be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.6 hereof as though it were a Lender, provided that such participant agrees to be subject to Section 10.3 hereof as though it were a Lender; and 

(7) each participant shall provide the relevant tax form required under Section 13.11.

The 

145 [4855-2702-8147_1] 4855-2702-8147_4 

entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Agent (in its capacity as Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. 

(B) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including its Notes, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledge or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower or any Lender (but only with respect to any entry relating to such Lender s Percentages and the principal amounts owing to such Lender) upon reasonable notice to the Agent and a copy of such information shall be provided to any such party on their prior written request. The Agent shall give prompt written notice to the Borrower of the making of any entry in the Register or any change in such entry. 

(D) The Borrower authorizes each Lender to disclose to any prospective assignee or participant which has satisfied the requirements hereunder, any and all financial information in such Lender s possession concerning the Credit Parties which has been delivered to such Lender pursuant to this Agreement, provided that each such prospective assignee or participant shall execute a confidentiality agreement 

146 [4855-2702-8147_1] 4855-2702-8147_4

(l) Substitution or Removal of Lenders 

.

The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. 

(b) With respect to any Lender (i) that has demanded compensation under Sections 3.4(c), 11.5 or 11.6 and has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 13.12(a), (ii) that has become a Defaulting Lender or (iii) that has failed to consent to a requested amendment, waiver or modification to any Loan Document that requires the consent of all Lenders or all affected Lenders in accordance with Section 13.10 and as to which the Majority Lenders have already consented (in each case, an Affected Lender ), then the Agent or (upon notice to the Agent) the Borrower may, at the Borrower s sole expense, require the Affected Lender to sell and assign all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including, without limitation, its Commitments, to an Eligible Assignee (which may be one or more of the Lenders) (such Eligible Assignee shall be referred to herein as the Purchasing Lender or Purchasing Lenders within two (2) Business Days after receiving notice from the Borrower requiring it to do so, for an aggregate price equal to the sum of the outstanding principal amount of all Advances made by it, interest and fees accrued for its 

152 [4855-2702-8147_1] 4855-2702-8147_4 

account through but excluding the date of such payment, and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the Purchasing Lender(s) (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts, including without limitation, if demanded by the Affected Lender, the amount of any compensation then due to the Affected Lender under Sections 3.4(c), 11.1, 11.5 and 11.6 to but excluding said date), payable (in immediately available funds) in cash. The Affected Lender, as assignor, such Purchasing Lender, as assignee, the Borrower and the Agent, shall enter into an Assignment Agreement pursuant to Section 13.8 hereof, whereupon such Purchasing Lender shall be a Lender party to this Agreement, shall be deemed to be an assignee hereunder and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Lender with a Revolving Credit Percentage equal to its ratable share of the then applicable Revolving Credit Aggregate Commitment and the applicable Percentages of the Term Loan of the Affected Lender, provided, however, that if the Affected Lender does not execute such Assignment Agreement within (2) Business Days of receipt thereof, the Agent may execute the Assignment Agreement as the Affected Lender s attorney-in-fact. Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the Agent and any officer or agent thereof, with full power of substitution, as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full power and authority in the name of such Lender or in its own name to execute and deliver the Assignment Agreement while such Lender is an Affected Lender hereunder (such power of attorney to be deemed coupled with an interest and irrevocable). In connection with any assignment pursuant to this Section 13.12(b), (I) the Borrower or the Purchasing Lender shall pay to the Agent the administrative fee for processing such assignment referred to in Section 13.8, (II) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a demand for compensation under clause (i) above, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter, and (III) in the case of any assignment resulting from a Lender failing to consent under clause (iii) above, the applicable assignee shall have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver or modification. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment pursuant to this Section 13.12(b) if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment cease to apply. 

Notwithstanding anything in this Section 13.12(b) to the contrary, (i) any Lender that acts as an Issuing Lender may not be replaced hereunder at any time it has any Letter of Credit outstanding hereunder unless arrangements satisfactory to such Lender (including the furnishing of a backstop standby letter of credit in form and substance, and issued by an issuer, reasonably satisfactory to such Issuing Lender or the depositing of cash collateral into a cash collateral account in amounts and pursuant to arrangements reasonably satisfactory to such Issuing Lender) have been made with respect to such outstanding Letter of Credit and (ii) the Lender that acts as the Agent may not be replaced hereunder. 
 (m) Withholding Taxes

153 [4855-2702-8147_1] 4855-2702-8147_4 

addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 13.13(e)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. 

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is a U.S. Borrower, 
 (A)	any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax; 
 (B)	any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:
