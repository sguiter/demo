 Financial Assets and Liabilities Not Measured at Fair Value 
 We believe that the carrying value of the consolidated amounts of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximated their estimated fair value as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, due to their relatively short-term nature and high probability of realization. 
 The carrying value of our previously held revolving credit facility and term loans, which were repaid in connection with the Closing, as well as our current variable-rate non-recourse property debt are classified as Level 2 in the GAAP fair value hierarchy. See Note 6 for discussion regarding our financing transactions during the period. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying value of our variable-rate debt approximated the estimated fair value as these instruments bear interest at floating rates which approximate market rates.

Of this balance, billion of interest rate swaps and billion of interest rate caps, net are a result of the Merger and subsequent financing transactions completed to finalize our go-forward capital structure, economically hedging the interest rate risk associated with our outstanding variable-rate property debt. Additionally, we have million of speculative interest rate swaps previously placed, which continue to have favorable blended interest rates as compared to current market rates. The below information details out the 2024 derivative transactions. 
 During the first quarter of 2024, we terminated interest rate swap positions not designated as hedging instruments. of the terminated instruments were pay-fixed, receive-floating interest rate swaps with a notional value of million, and were offsetting pay-floating, receive-fixed interest rate swaps with a notional value of million. of the terminated instruments was a forward starting interest rate swap entered into in anticipation of additional fixed-rate property debt with a notional value of million and was replaced by a new forward starting interest rate swap with a notional value of million. Additionally, AIR entered into one forward starting interest rate swap with a notional value of million, and restructured one pay-fixed, receive-floating interest rate swap, to better align the maturity date with the related term loans. As a result of these transactions, AIR received million in cash during the three months ended March 31, 2024. Additionally, during the first quarter of 2024, the Operating Partnership entered into three pay-fixed, receive-floating interest rate swaps, with a notional value of million. 
 During the second quarter of 2024, we terminated forward starting interest rate swap positions not designated as hedging instruments with a notional value of million. As a result of these transactions, the Operating Partnership received million in cash. Additionally, we entered into one interest rate cap not designated as a hedging instrument with a notional value of million to economically hedge our variable-rate property debt maturing in July 2026 at a maximum interest rate of . 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we placed interest rate caps due to lender requirements at the property level. However, we simultaneously sold partially offsetting interest rate caps for a portion of the total notional value due to the fact that a portion of the related debt was also hedged with interest rate swaps. The net impact of these interest rate caps, sold interest rate caps, and interest rate swaps, which are not designated as hedging instruments, is to economically fix or cap our variable interest rates at a weighted-average interest rate of on billion of variable rate non-recourse property debt maturing in the second and third quarters of 2029. After consideration of these derivative instruments, we have no variable rate non-recourse property debt that is not fixed or capped at the above weighted-average rates until the third quarter of 2026. 
 The pay-fixed, receive-floating interest rate swaps have an aggregate notional value of billion and economically hedge our variable-rate property debt and mature between August 2026 and August 2027. of the interest rate swaps have a notional adjustment period, which reduces the aggregate notional amount by billion by September 2025. The interest rate caps have an aggregate notional value of billion and mature in August 2026 to October 2026, and the sold partially offsetting interest rate caps have a notional value of billion and mature in August 2026 to October 2026. The sold partially offsetting interest rate caps have a notional adjustment period, which reduces the aggregate notional value to billion in August 2025 to October 2025.

 Partners X L.P., indirectly through the Parent Parties, controls the General Partner and Special Limited Partner of the AIR Operating Partnership. Additionally, all stock options and restricted stock awards outstanding, whether vested or unvested, were cancelled and converted into the right to receive cash and all Class A preferred stock outstanding were redeemed by AIR resulting in the mirrored preferred units at the AIR Operating Partnership to be cancelled. The issued and outstanding equity interests of the AIR Operating Partnership, including the common OP Units, preferred OP units, and LTIP units were unaffected by the Merger and remain issued and outstanding and continue to have the rights and privileges set forth in the Partnership Agreement. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 Because our operating results depend primarily on income from our apartment communities, the supply of and demand for apartments influences our operating results. Additionally, the level of expenses required to operate and maintain our apartment communities and the pace and price at which we acquire and dispose of our apartment communities affects our operating results. 
 The following discussion and analysis of the results of our operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 . 
 Financial Highlights 
 Net loss attributable to AIR Operating Partnership's common unitholders per unit on a dilutive basis was 1.12) and 2.37) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 4.42 and 4.34 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, due primarily to: 
 Gains on dispositions in the prior year; 
 Merger-related costs incurred in the current year; 
 Losses on derivative instruments in the current year compared to gains in the prior year; 
 Increased interest expense; and 
 Increased loss on extinguishment of debt in connection with the Merger; partially offset by 
 Revenue growth primarily driven by an increase in residential rents and ADO, as defined below. 
 Results of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to 2023 
 Property Operations 
 We have two segments: Same Store and Other Real Estate. Our Same Store segment includes communities that are owned and managed by AIR and have reached a stabilized level of operations. Our Other Real Estate segment includes four properties acquired in 2023, two properties acquired in 2024, and two properties undergoing planned property capital investment. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our Same Store segment included 69 apartment communities with 24,272 apartment homes and our Other Real Estate segment included 8 apartment communities with 3,118 apartment homes. 
 Proportionate Property Net Operating Income 
 Our proportionate share of financial information includes our share of unconsolidated real estate partnerships and excludes the noncontrolling interest partners share of consolidated real estate partnerships. We believe proportionate information benefits the users of our financial information by providing the amount of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, and other ite ms attributable to the AIR Operating Partnership unitholders. 
 We use proportionate property NOI to assess the operating performance of our communities. Proportionate property NOI reflects our share of rental and other property revenues, excluding utility reimbursements, less direct property operating expenses, net of utility reimbursements. In our condensed consolidated statements of operations, utility reimbursements are included in rental and other property revenues in accordance with GAAP. 
 We do not include offsite costs associated with property management, casualty gains or losses, or the results of apartment communities sold or held for sale in our assessment of segment performance. Accordingly, these items are not allocated to our segment results discussed below.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to 2023, our Same Store proportionate property NOI increased by 0.5 . This increase was attributable primarily to a 2.1 increase in residential rates and a 30 basis points increase in Average Daily Occupancy ("ADO"), resulting in a 4.3 million, or 2.6 , increase in rental and other property revenues. Additionally, we incurred higher property operating expenses primarily due to unfavorable tax assessments in the Miami market as compared to 2023. Controllable operating expenses remained relatively flat, increasing 40 basis points as compared to 2023. 
 Other Real Estate proportionate property NOI for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2023, increased by 5.1 million, due primarily to the earn-in of three properties acquired in the third quarter of 2023, and two properties acquired in 2024.

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2023, our Same Store proportionate property NOI increased by 3.8 . This increase was attributable primarily to a 2.9 increase in residential rates and a 60 basis points increase in ADO, resulting in a 18.1 million, or 3.7 , increase in rental and other property revenues. Additionally, we incurred higher property operating expenses primarily due to unfavorable tax assessments in the Miami market as compared to 2023. Controllable operating expenses remained relatively flat, increasing 50 basis points as compared to 2023.

 Ot her Real Estate proportionate property NOI for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2023, increased by 13.1 million, due primarily to the earn-in of three properties acquired in the third quarter of 2023, and two properties acquired in 2024. 
 Non-Segment Real Estate Operations 
 Operating income amounts not attributed to our segments include offsite costs associated with property management, casualty losses, and the results of apartment communities sold or held for sale, which we do not allocate to our segments for purposes of evaluating segment performance. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2023, non-segment real estate operations decreased by 1.7 million due primarily to an increase in casualty losses related to Hurricane Helene, partially offset by an increase in property management revenue due to the increase in apartment communities held by joint venture partners. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2023, non-segment real estate operations were relatively flat. 
 General and administrative expenses 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2023, general and administrative expenses remained relatively flat. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2023, general and administrative expenses increased by 7.2 million due primarily to timing of incentive compensation. 
 Other expenses, net 
 Other expenses, net, includes costs associated with our risk management activities, partnership administration expenses, and certain non-recurring items. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2023, other expenses, net increased by 45.0 million and 53.6 million, respectively, due primarily to the write-off of costs associated with pre-development, development, and redevelopment projects, increased separation costs and the acceleration of share-based compensation expense due to the departure of certain executives, a reduction in short duration income due to the sale of our New England and New York portfolios in 2023, an increase in non-recurring costs related to a business transformation project, and certain one-time legal matters. 
 Interest income 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2023, interest income increased by 2.0 million and 2.9 million , respectively, due primarily to higher cash on hand invested in short-term liquid investments. 
 Interest expense 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2023, interest expense increased by 71.7 million and 64.5 million, respectively, due primarily to a 2.2 billion increase in the average debt outstanding during the period and a 170 basis point increase in the weighted-average interest rates; offset partially by the acceleration of the reclassification of unrealized gain on derivative assets into interest expense. 
 Loss on extinguishment of debt 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2023, loss on extinguishment of debt increased by 8.6 million and 34.9 million, respectively, due primarily to unamortized discounts, related expenses and fees, and prepayment penalties associated with the termination of debt instruments during the second and third quarter of 2024. 
 Gain on dispositions and impairments of real estate

 Loss from unconsolidated real estate partnerships 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2023, loss from unconsolidated real estate partnerships decreased 5.1 million due to an increase in NOI from our unconsolidated joint ventures and a reduction in amortization expense of intangible assets. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2023, loss from unconsolidated real estate partnerships increased 2.1 million primarily due to a full period of operating activity at 12 apartment communities included in the Core JV and Value-Add JV, which includes higher depreciation and amortization expense related to the fair value contributed, compared to a partial period of operating activity in the prior year. 
 Merger-related costs 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 1.1 million and 169.0 million of merger-related costs, primarily consisting of regulatory, advisory, legal, consulting, banking services, loan assumption fees, and the acceleration of share-based compensation related to the cancellation of the stock options and restricted stock awards incurred in connection with the Merger. 
 Net Asset Value 
 On June 28, 2024, the General Partner adopted a valuation policy (the Valuation Policy regarding the determination of the Net Asset Value NAV of the common OP Unit. The Valuation Policy was furnished as Exhibit 99.2 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 1, 2024. The Valuation Policy sets out the methodology to be used in calculating the net asset value of the common OP Units and provides for the determination of NAV on a quarterly basis. 
 The NAV of the common OP Unit is determined by the General Partner in good faith on the basis of such information as it considers, in its reasonable judgment, appropriate. 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the NAV of the common OP Units for purposes of redemption, as adjusted for a special distribution, was 25.62. As of September 30, 2024, the NAV of the common OP Units for purposes of redemption was determined to be 25.69 per common OP Unit, which will be the basis for the NAV through the quarter ending December 31, 2024, adjusted for any distributions or material changes. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 We prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions. We believe that the critical accounting policies that involve our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements relate to the impairment of our long-lived assets. 
 Our critical accounting estimates are described in more detail in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of AIR s and the AIR Operating Partnership s combined Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no other significant changes in our critical accounting estimates from those reported in our Form 10-K and we believe that the related judgments and assessments have been

 consistently applied and produce financial information that fairly depicts the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows for all periods presented. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity 
 Liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations. Our primary source of liquidity is cash flows from operations and funding from our General Partner and Special Limited Partner. Additional sources are proceeds from dispositions of apartment communities, proceeds from refinancing existing property debt and borrowings under new property debt. As of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents was 668.6 million. 
 In the third quarter of 2024, we placed non-recourse variable-rate and fixed-rate property debt totaling 4.5 billion. The net proceeds from these financing transactions were used to repay previously existing debt totaling 3.1 billion and to fund a special distribution on August 1, 2024 of 892.0 million to OP unitholders. See Note 6 of the condensed consolidated financial statements, included in Item 1 , for discussion regarding debt transactions occurring during 2024. 
 Except for the transactions described above, there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations and commitments outside of the ordinary course of business. 
 Leverage and Capital Resources 
 The availability of credit and its related effect on the overall economy may affect our liquidity and future financing activities, both through changes in interest rates and access to financing. Any adverse changes in the lending environment could negatively affect our liquidity. 
 If financing options become unavailable for our future debt needs, we may consider alternative sources of liquidity, such as reductions in capital spending, or proceeds from the sale of apartment communities. 
 The combination of non-recourse debt, preferred OP Units, and redeemable noncontrolling interests in a consolidated real estate partnership comprise our total leverage. The weighted-average remaining term to maturity for our total leverage was 5.3 years as of September 30, 2024, inclusive of extension options, with a weighted-average interest rate of 6.1 . 
 Changes in Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash 
 The following discussion relates to changes in consolidated cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash due to operating, investing, and financing activities, which are presented in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows in Item 1 of this report. 
 Operating Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 65.0 million. Our operating cash flow is affected primarily by rental rates, occupancy levels, operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment communities, and changes in working capital items. Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 236.8 million compared to the same period in 2023, due primarily to merger-related costs incurred in connection with the Merger, higher cash paid for interest due to higher average debt balances and higher average rates during the period, and the contribution of apartment communities to two unconsolidated joint ventures throughout the second and third quarters of 2023. 
 Investing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net cash used in investing activities of 346.9 million consisted primarily of purchases of real estate and capital expenditures. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our net cash used in investing activities of 270.0 million consisted primarily of purchases of real estate and capital expenditures, offset partially by proceeds from dispositions of real estate and distributions from unconsolidated real estate partnerships. 
 
 29 

Table of Contents 

 Capital additions totaled 118.3 million and 128.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We generally fund capital additions with cash provided by operating activities and cash proceeds from sales of apartment communities. 
 We categorize capital spending for communities in our portfolio broadly into five primary categories: 
 capital replacements, expenditures that are necessary to help preserve the value of and maintain building infrastructure at the communities; 
 capital enhancements, which may include kitchen and bath remodeling, energy conservation projects, and investments in more durable, longer-lived materials designed to position assets for higher rental levels in their respective markets; 
 initial capital expenditures, which represent capital additions contemplated in the underwriting at our recently acquired communities. These amounts are considered in the underwriting of the acquisition and are therefore included with the purchase price when determining expected returns; 
 casualty, which represents capitalized costs incurred in connection with the restoration of an apartment community after a casualty event; and 
 other, which represents capitalized costs in connection with tenant improvements, entitlement; and planning. 
 We exclude the amounts of capital spending related to apartment communities sold or classified as held for sale at the end of the period from the foregoing measures in order to view the spend for the continuing portfolio. 
 A summary of the capital spending for these categories, along with a reconciliation of the total for these categories to the capital expenditures reported in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, are presented below (in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Capital Replacements 26,581 24,605 Capital Enhancements 50,266 65,244 Initial Capital Expenditures 34,582 32,620 Casualty 5,758 5,036 Other 1,086 869 Total capital additions 118,273 128,374 Plus: additions related to apartment communities sold and held for sale 12,674 Consolidated capital additions 118,273 141,048 Plus: net change in accrued capital spending (7,619) (193) Total capital expenditures per condensed consolidated statements of cash flows 110,654 140,855 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we capitalized 10.2 million and 12.7 million of indirect costs, respectively. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities of 833.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of proceeds from non-recourse property debt, offset partially by merger-related distributions and the repayment of multiple debt instruments. Net cash used in financing activities of 199.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted primarily of net repayments of our revolving credit facility, the repayment of term loans, payment of dividends, and repurchases of AIR Common Stock and OP Units, offset partially by net proceeds from non-recourse property debt. 
 
 Future Capital Needs 
 We expect to fund any future acquisitions, debt maturities, and other capital spending principally with proceeds from apartment community sales, additional borrowings, operating cash flows, and funding from our General Partner and 
 
 30 

Table of Contents 

 Special Limited Partner. We believe, based on the information available at this time, that we have sufficient cash on hand and access to additional sources of liquidity to meet our operational needs for the next 12 months. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Our primary market risks are refunding risk, that is the availability of property debt or other cash sources to refund maturing property debt, and repricing risk, that is the possibility of increases in base interest rates and credit risk spreads. We use working capital to fund short-term uses, with long-term uses expected to be financed by cash from operating activities, proceeds from apartment community sales, and long-term debt. We use derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps, interest rate caps, and treasury rate locks, to reduce our exposure to interest rate risk. We closely monitor the credit quality of the institutions with which we transact. 
 As of September 30, 2024, on a consolidated basis, we had 2.2 billion of non-recourse fixed-rate property debt and 4.1 billion of non-recourse variable-rate property debt outstanding. As of September 30, 2024, we have 3.0 billion of interest rate swap derivatives which reduce our total variable rate exposure by 3.0 billion, by fixing to a weighted-average interest rate of 6.5 . Additionally, we have net 1.1 billion of interest rate caps, which economically cap our variable interest rate exposure on the remaining 1.1 billion of variable-rate debt at a weighted-average rate of 6.7 . As of September 30, 2024, the capped rate on our interest rate caps is below the prevailing market rate. 
 After consideration of our interest rate swap derivatives and our interest rate caps, we estimate that a change in the floating rate of 100-basis points with constant credit risk spreads would not increase our interest expense on an annual basis and would decrease interest expense by 4.6 million on an annual basis. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have 675 million of speculative interest rate swap derivatives. As a result, we estimate that a change in the floating rate of 100-basis points with constant credit risk spreads would increase or decrease gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net by 6.8 million on an annual basis. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 668.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, a portion of which bears interest at variable rates, which may partially mitigate the effect of an increase in variable rates on our variable-rate debt discussed above. 
 After consideration of the interest rate swaps and interest rate caps derivatives described above, we estimate that a change in the floating rate of 100-basis points with constant credit risk spreads would decrease net (loss) income by 12.2 million and increase net (loss) income by 16.8 million, respectively, on an annual basis. 
 We estimate the fair value of debt instruments as described in Note 10 to the condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 . The estimated fair value of total indebtedness, including our non-recourse fixed-rate and variable-rate property debt was approximately 6.1 billion as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The AIR Operating Partnership s management, with the participation of our co-principal executive officers and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, our co-principal executive officers and chief financial officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There has been no change in the AIR Operating Partnership s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the third quarter of 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the AIR Operating Partnership s internal control over financial reporting.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 Except as set forth below, as of the date of this report, there have been no material changes from the risk factors in AIR s and the AIR Operating Partnership s combined Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 In light of the Merger, Risks Related to AIR Common Stock, Risks Related to AIR s Corporate Structure and Risks Related to Tax Laws and Regulations are hereby deleted and Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and Financing is being updated as set forth below. Additionally, we are supplementing the risk factors discussed in the Annual Report with the following risk factors under Risks Related to Our Organization and Structure, Risks Related to Conflicts of Interest, and Risks Related to Valuation. This section should be read in conjunction with the risk factors contained in our Annual Report. 
 Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and Financing 
 Increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense and reduce our profitability. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 4.1 billion of variable-rate indebtedness outstanding before consideration of floating-to-fixed-rate interest rate swaps and interest rate cap derivatives. After consideration of these derivatives, we estimate that a change in the floating rate of 100-basis points with constant credit risk spreads would increase or decrease interest expense by million or 4.6 million, net, on an annual basis, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 668.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, a portion of which bears interest at variable rates, which may partially mitigate the effect of an increase in variable rates on our variable-rate indebtedness discussed above. 
 Our debt financing could result in foreclosure resulting in a loss of income and value, prevent us from making distributions on our equity, or otherwise adversely affect our liquidity. 
 We have fixed-rate and variable-rate property debt, maturing at various times over the next few years, which are secured by assets of certain subsidiaries of the AIR Operating Partnership. Over time, we may become party to one or more additional financing arrangements, including credit facilities or other bank debt, and bonds. 
 In connection with such financing arrangements, we are subject to the risk that: (i) our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest; (ii) our indebtedness may not be refinanced; or (iii) the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of then-existing indebtedness. If we are unable to make required payments of principal and interest or are unable to refinance at maturity on favorable terms, or at all, the lenders could foreclose on the collateral securing that debt, resulting in the loss to us of income and asset value. 
 We also anticipate that certain of our subsidiaries will maintain a certain amount of non-recourse property-level indebtedness. If we fail to make required payments of principal and interest on our mortgage debt, our lenders could foreclose on the apartment communities and other collateral securing such debt, resulting in the loss to us of income and asset value. 
 Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of debt that we may incur. 
 Disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain financing and the cost of available financing and could adversely affect our liquidity. 
 Our ability to obtain financing and the cost of such financing depends on the overall condition of the United States credit markets. During periods of economic uncertainty, the United States credit markets may experience significant liquidity disruptions, which may cause the cost on debt financings to widen considerably and make obtaining financing, both non-recourse property debt and corporate borrowings such as those under a credit facility, more difficult. In particular, apartment borrowers have benefited from the historic willingness of the Federal National Mortgage Association Fannie Mae ), and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Freddie Mac ), to make substantial amounts of loans secured by multi-family properties, even in times of economic distress. These two lenders are federally chartered and subject to federal regulation, which is subject to change, making uncertain their prospects and ability to provide liquidity in a future downturn. 
 
 32 

Table of Contents 

 If our ability to obtain financing is adversely affected, we may be unable to satisfy scheduled maturities on existing financing through other sources of liquidity, which could result in lender foreclosure, resulting in loss of income and asset value, both of which would adversely affect our liquidity. 
 Because real estate investments are relatively illiquid, we may not be able to sell apartment communities when appropriate. 
 Real estate investments are relatively illiquid and generally cannot be sold quickly. Thus, we may not be able to change our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other market conditions. Our ability to dispose of apartment communities in the future will depend on prevailing economic and market conditions, including the cost and availability of financing. This could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 
 Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations. 
 From time to time, we may enter into interest rate hedge agreements to manage some of our exposure to interest rate volatility. Interest rate hedge agreements involve risks, such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements. In addition, these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to changes in interest rates. These risk factors may lead to failure to hedge effectively against changes in interest rates and therefore could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 Covenant restrictions may limit our operations and impact our ability to make payments to our investors. 
 Some of our existing or future debt and other securities may contain covenants that restrict our operations and impact our ability to make distributions or other payments to our investors unless certain financial tests or other criteria are satisfied. AIR Operating Partnership s outstanding preferred units prohibit the payment of dividends on common OP Units if we fail to pay the dividends to which the holders of the preferred units are entitled. In addition, our debt agreements contain other customary affirmative and negative covenants. 
 We may increase leverage, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our indebtedness. 
 We may decide to increase our leverage. Our board of directors will consider a number of factors when evaluating our level of indebtedness and when making decisions regarding the issuance, or placement, of new indebtedness, including the estimated market value of our assets and the ability of particular assets, and our company as a whole, to generate cash flow to cover the expected debt service. Although our credit facilities and unsecured notes payable may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, our governing documents do not limit the amount of debt we may incur, and our board of directors may change our target debt levels at any time without the approval of our common unitholders. We may incur additional indebtedness from time to time in the future to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes. If we do so, the risks related to our indebtedness could intensify. 
 Risks Related to Our Organization and Structure 
 We are controlled by Blackstone and its interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future. 
 Following the Merger, affiliates of Blackstone control the General Partner and AIR Operating Partnership is a subsidiary of the Parent Entities. Accordingly, Blackstone has significant influence with respect to our management, business plans and policies, including the election and removal of our officers and directors. Blackstone and its affiliates engage in a broad spectrum of activities, including investments in real estate generally. In the ordinary course of their business activities, Blackstone and its affiliates may engage in activities where their interests conflict with our interests or those of our common unitholders. Blackstone also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. In addition, Blackstone may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions that, in its judgment, could enhance its investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to you. 
 Risks Related to Conflicts of Interest 
 Various potential and actual conflicts of interest will arise, and these conflicts may not be identified or resolved in a manner favorable to us. 
 Blackstone has conflicts of interest, or conflicting loyalties, as a result of the numerous activities and relationships of Blackstone and its affiliates, partners, members, shareholders, officers, directors and employees, some of which are described herein. However, not all potential, apparent and actual conflicts of interest are included herein, and additional 
 
 33 

Table of Contents 

 conflicts of interest could arise as a result of new activities, transactions or relationships commenced in the future. If any matter arises that we and our affiliates determine in our good faith judgment constitutes an actual and material conflict of interest, we and our affiliates will take such actions as we determine appropriate to mitigate the conflict. 
 The personnel of Blackstone are not required to dedicate a specific portion of their time to the management of our business. 
 Blackstone affiliates are not obligated to dedicate any specific personnel exclusively to us, nor are they or their personnel obligated to dedicate any specific portion of their time to the management of our business. Affiliates of Blackstone and its portfolio companies may provide services to us, but we cannot provide any assurances regarding the amount of time that such affiliates will dedicate to the management of our business and such affiliates may have conflicts in allocating time, resources and services among our business and any other investment vehicles and accounts. 
 We and Blackstone vehicles have competed, and in the future will likely compete, with or enter into transactions with existing and future private and public investment vehicles established and/or managed by Blackstone or its affiliates, which may present various conflicts of interest that restrict our ability to pursue certain investment opportunities or take other actions that are beneficial to our business and/or result in decisions that are not in the best interests of our unitholders. 
 We are subject to conflicts of interest arising out of our relationship with Blackstone, including the General Partner and its affiliates. Certain Blackstone employees serve on our board of directors. If any matter arises that Blackstone determines in its good faith judgment constitutes an actual and material conflict of interest, Blackstone and relevant affiliates will take the actions they determine appropriate to mitigate the conflict. There is no guarantee that the policies and procedures adopted by us, or the policies and procedures adopted by Blackstone and its affiliates, will enable us to identify, adequately address or mitigate these conflicts of interest in a way that is favorable to us, which could result in increased costs to our unitholders. Some examples of conflicts of interest that may arise by virtue of our relationship with Blackstone include: 
 Broad and Wide-Ranging Activities . Blackstone and its affiliates engage in a broad spectrum of activities, including a broad range of activities relating to investments in the real estate industry, and have invested or committed billions of dollars in capital through various investment funds, managed accounts and other vehicles affiliated with Blackstone. In the ordinary course of their business activities, Blackstone and its affiliates may engage in activities where the interests of certain divisions of Blackstone and its affiliates, or the interests of their clients may conflict with the interests of our unitholders. Certain of these divisions and entities affiliated with Blackstone have or may have an investment strategy similar to our investment strategy and therefore will likely compete with us. 
 Blackstone s Policies and Procedures . Specified policies and procedures implemented by Blackstone and its affiliates to mitigate potential conflicts of interest and address certain regulatory requirements and contractual restrictions may reduce the advantages across Blackstone s and its affiliates various businesses that Blackstone expects to draw on for purposes of pursuing attractive investment opportunities. Because Blackstone has many different businesses, it is subject to a number of actual and potential conflicts of interest, greater regulatory oversight and more legal and contractual restrictions than that to which it would otherwise be subject if it had just one line of business. In addressing these conflicts and regulatory, legal and contractual requirements across its various businesses, Blackstone has implemented certain policies and procedures (e.g., information walls) that may reduce the benefits that Blackstone could otherwise expect to utilize for purposes of identifying and managing our real estate investments. For example, Blackstone may come into possession of material non-public information with respect to companies that are clients of Blackstone or its affiliates, in which the General Partner may be considering making an investment. As a consequence, that information, which could be of benefit to us, might become restricted to those other businesses and otherwise be unavailable to us, and could also restrict our activities. Additionally, the terms of confidentiality or other agreements with or related to companies in which any investment vehicle of Blackstone has or has considered making an investment or which is otherwise a client of Blackstone and its affiliates may restrict or otherwise limit the ability of Blackstone or its affiliates, to engage in businesses or activities competitive with such companies. 
 Assignment and Sharing or Limitation of Rights . In the future, we may invest alongside other Blackstone vehicles and in connection therewith have and may, for legal, tax, regulatory or other reasons which may be unrelated to us, share with or assign to such other Blackstone vehicles certain of our rights, in whole or in part, or to limit our rights, including certain control- and/or foreclosure-related rights with respect to such shared investments and/or otherwise agree to implement certain procedures to mitigate conflicts of interest which typically involve 
 
 34 

Table of Contents 

 maintaining a noncontrolling interest in any such investment and a forbearance of our rights, including certain non-economic rights, subject to certain limitations. While it is expected that our participation in connection with any such investments and transactions would be negotiated by third parties on market prices, such investments and transactions will give rise to potential or actual conflicts of interest. We cannot make assurances that any such conflict will be resolved in our favor. Such sharing or assignment of rights could make it more difficult for us to protect our interests and could give rise to a conflict (which may be exacerbated in the case of financial distress) and could result in another Blackstone vehicle exercising such rights in a way adverse to us. 
 Entering into Financing Transactions with Other Blackstone Vehicles . We may from time to time engage in financing transactions with Blackstone vehicles. We and/or Blackstone may face conflicts of interest in connection with any borrowings or disputes related to such financing agreement(s) which may adversely impact us. 
 Underwriting and Other Relationships . As part of its regular business, Blackstone provides a broad range of underwriting, investment banking, placement agent services and other services. In connection with selling investments by way of a public offering, a Blackstone broker-dealer may act as the managing underwriter or a member of the underwriting syndicate on a firm commitment basis and purchase securities on that basis. Blackstone may retain any commissions, remuneration, or other profits and receive compensation from such underwriting activities, which have the potential to create conflicts of interest. Blackstone may also participate in underwriting syndicates from time to time with respect to us or portfolio companies/entities of Blackstone vehicles, or may otherwise be involved in the private placement of debt or equity securities issued by us or such portfolio companies/entities, or otherwise in arranging financings with respect thereto or advising on such transactions. Subject to applicable law, Blackstone may receive underwriting fees, placement commissions, or other compensation with respect to such activities, which will not be shared with us or our unitholders. 
 In the regular course of its investment banking business, Blackstone represents potential purchasers, sellers and other involved parties, including corporations, financial buyers, management, shareholders and institutions, with respect to assets that are suitable for investment by us. In such case, Blackstone s client would typically require Blackstone to act exclusively on its behalf, thereby precluding us from acquiring such assets. Blackstone is under no obligation to decline any such engagement to make the investment opportunity available to us. 
 Blackstone has long-term relationships with a significant number of corporations and their senior management. In determining whether to invest in a particular transaction, we may consider those relationships, which may result in certain transactions that we will not undertake in view of such relationships. 
 Service Providers . Certain of our service providers, or their affiliates (including accountants, administrators, lenders, brokers, attorneys, consultants, title agents, loan servicing and administration providers, property managers and investment banking or commercial banking firms) also provide goods or services to or have business, personal or other relationships with Blackstone. For example, Blackstone may hold equity or other investments in companies or businesses in the real estate industry and other industries that may provide products or services to or otherwise contract with us or other Blackstone vehicles. In connection with any such investment, Blackstone or other Blackstone vehicles (or their respective portfolio companies/entities) may make referrals or introductions to other portfolio companies/entities in an effort, in part, to increase the customer base of such companies or businesses, and therefore the value of the investment, or because such referrals or introductions may result in financial incentives (including additional equity ownership) and/or milestones benefiting the referring or introducing party that are tied or related to participation by portfolio companies/entities. We will not share in any fees, economics or equity accruing to Blackstone or such other Blackstone vehicles as a result of these relationships. In addition, we may enter into agreements regarding group procurement (such as a group purchasing organization), benefits management, purchase of title and/or other insurance policies (which will from time to time be pooled and discounted due to scale) from a third party or a Blackstone affiliate, and other similar operational, administrative, or management related initiatives that result in commissions, discounts or similar payments to Blackstone or its affiliates (including personnel), including related to a portion of the savings achieved that may result in higher costs than historically incurred. Such service providers may be sources of investment opportunities or co-investors or commercial counterparties. Such relationships may influence the General Partner in deciding whether to select such service provider. In certain circumstances, service providers, or their affiliates, may charge different rates (including below-market rates or at no cost) or have different arrangements for services provided to Blackstone or its affiliates as compared to services provided to us, which in certain circumstances may result in more favorable rates or arrangements than those payable by us. 
 
 35 

Table of Contents 

 In addition, certain advisors and service providers (including law firms) may temporarily provide their personnel to Blackstone, us or other Blackstone vehicles or their portfolio companies pursuant to various arrangements including at cost or at no cost. While often we and such other Blackstone-advised funds and their portfolio companies are the beneficiaries of these types of arrangements, Blackstone is from time to time a beneficiary of these arrangements as well, including in circumstances where the advisor or service provider also provides services to us in the ordinary course. Such personnel may provide services in respect of multiple matters, including in respect of matters related to Blackstone, its affiliates and/or portfolio companies and any costs of such personnel may be allocated accordingly. 
 Material, Non-Public Information . We, directly or through Blackstone, the General Partner or certain of their respective affiliates may come into possession of material non-public information. Disclosure of such information to the personnel responsible for management of our business may be on a need-to-know basis only, and we may not be free to act upon any such information. Therefore, we may not have access to material non-public information in the possession of Blackstone which might be relevant to an investment decision to be made by the General Partner on our behalf, and the General Partner may initiate a transaction or purchase or sell an investment which, if such information had been known to it, may not have been undertaken. Due to these restrictions, the General Partner may not be able to initiate a transaction on our behalf that it otherwise might have initiated and may not be able to purchase or sell an investment that it otherwise might have purchased or sold, which could negatively affect our operations. 
 Possible Future Activities . Blackstone and their affiliates continue to develop relationships with a significant number of companies, financial sponsors and their senior managers, including relationships with clients who may hold or may have held investments similar to those intended to be made by us. These clients may themselves represent appropriate investment opportunities for us or may compete with us for investment opportunities. In addition, Blackstone may enter into one or more strategic relationships in certain regions or with respect to certain types of investments that, although intended to provide greater opportunities for us, may require us to share such opportunities or otherwise limit the amount of an opportunity we can otherwise take. 
 Transactions with Blackstone Vehicles . From time to time, we may enter into purchase and sale transactions with Blackstone vehicles. Such transactions will be conducted in accordance with our internal corporate policies and applicable laws and regulations to ensure fairness to the Operating Partnership. 
 Family Relationships . Certain personnel and other professionals of Blackstone have family members or relatives that are actively involved in the industries and sectors in which we invest and/or have business, personal, financial or other relationships with companies in the real estate industry, which gives rise to potential or actual conflicts of interest. For example, such family members or relatives might be officers, directors, personnel or owners of companies or assets which are actual or potential investments of us or our other counterparties. Moreover, in certain instances, we may transact with companies that are owned by such family members or relatives or in respect of which such family members or relatives have other involvement. In most such circumstances, we will not be precluded from undertaking any of these investment activities or transactions. To the extent Blackstone determines appropriate, it may put in place conflict mitigation strategies with respect to a particular circumstance, such as internal information barriers or recusal, disclosure or other steps determined appropriate by Blackstone or the General Partner. 
 Risks Related to Valuation 
 Redemptions of our units are generally based on our most recent quarter-end calculations of NAV per common OP unit, which calculations are not current as of a future date. 
 Generally, the price at which we make redemptions of our common OP Units will equal the NAV (as defined in our Valuation Policy) per common OP Unit as of the last day of the prior calendar quarter. The NAV per common OP Unit, if calculated as of the date on which you deliver a Notice of Redemption (as defined in our Partnership Agreement), may be significantly different than the redemption price you receive. Certain of our investments or liabilities could change in value significantly between the end of the prior calendar quarter as of which our NAV per common OP Unit is determined and the date that you deliver a Notice of Redemption. Because the price at which your common OP Units may be redeemed by us is generally based on our prior calendar quarter s NAV per common OP Unit, you may receive less than realizable value for your investment. 
 The General Partner has discretion to determine whether a Material Event (as defined in our Valuation Policy) has occurred, and whether and in what amount to make adjustments to the Value of a REIT Share, prior to the end of the then-current calendar quarter.

Table of Contents 

 The General Partner may, in its sole discretion, but is not obligated to, determine the Value of a REIT Share as of any particular Valuation Date (as referenced in our Valuation Policy) to be an amount that it believes is more appropriate than the most recently determined NAV per common OP Unit (including by updating a previously determined NAV per common OP Unit) where it believes there has been a Material Change (as defined in our Valuation Policy) (positive or negative) to our NAV per common OP Unit since the end of the prior calendar quarter. If the General Partner determines that a Material Event has not occurred, or determines that one has occurred but does not adjust the Value of a REIT Share to account for such Material Change, you may receive less than realizable value for your investment. On the other hand, if the General Partner determines that a Material Event has occurred and adjusts the Value of a REIT Share to account for such Material Change, the amount of the adjustment may not fully and accurately reflect the impact of the Material Event. As a result, you may receive less than realizable value for your investment. See -It may be difficult to reflect, fully and accurately, material events that may impact our quarterly NAV per common OP Unit below. 
 Valuations and appraisals of our real estate are estimates of fair value and may not necessarily correspond to realizable value. 
 Our properties will initially be valued at an aggregate value implied by the enterprise value of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. For the purpose of calculating our quarterly NAV, any properties subsequently acquired will initially be valued at cost, which we expect to represent fair value at that time. The General Partner will then value our properties quarterly, based on current material market data and other information deemed relevant, with review for reasonableness each quarterly by an independent valuation advisor. Each property will be valued by an independent third-party appraisal firm annually. Annual appraisals may be delayed for a short period in certain circumstances. Concurrent with the appraisal process, the General Partner will value each property and, taking into account the appraisal, among other factors, will determine the appropriate valuation within the range provided by the independent third-party appraisal firm. 
 Although quarterly valuations of each of our real properties will be reviewed for reasonableness by an independent valuation advisor, such reviews are based on asset- and portfolio-level information provided by the General Partner, including historical operating revenues and expenses of the properties, lease agreements on the properties, revenues and expenses of the properties, information regarding recent or planned capital expenditures and any other information relevant to valuing the real property, which information will not be independently verified by the independent valuation advisor. While the independent valuation advisor is responsible for reviewing our property valuations as set forth in our Valuation Policy, the independent valuation advisor is not responsible for, and does not calculate, our NAV per common OP Unit, and the General Partner is ultimately and solely responsible for the determination of our NAV per common OP Unit. 
 Within the parameters of our Valuation Policy, the valuation methodologies used to value our properties and certain of our investments will involve subjective judgments and projections with respect to industry performance, general business, economic and regulatory conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond its control and our control, as well as certain factual matters, and may not be accurate. For example, our independent valuation advisor and other independent third-party appraisal firms will assume that we have clear and marketable title to each real estate property valued, that no title defects exist unless specifically informed to the contrary, that improvements were made in accordance with law, that no hazardous materials are present or were present previously, that no deed restrictions exist, and that no changes to zoning ordinances or regulations governing use, density or shape are pending or being considered. Furthermore, our independent valuation advisor s review, opinions and conclusions will necessarily be based upon market, economic, financial and other circumstances and conditions existing prior to the valuation, and any material change in such circumstances and conditions may affect our independent valuation advisor s review and conclusions. Our independent valuation advisor s review reports may contain other assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth in the respective appraisal reports that qualify the review, opinions and conclusions set forth therein. Further, valuations do not necessarily represent the price at which an asset would sell, since market prices of assets can only be determined by negotiation between a willing buyer and seller. 
 As such, valuations and appraisals of our properties will be only estimates of fair value, and the carrying value of our real properties may not reflect the price at which the properties could be sold in the market. Our NAV per common OP Unit does not represent the amount of our assets less our liabilities in accordance with GAAP. The difference between carrying value and the ultimate sales price could be material. In addition, accurate valuations are more difficult to obtain in times of low transaction volume because there are fewer market transactions that can be considered in the context of the appraisal. There will be no retroactive adjustment in the valuation of such assets or the price we paid to redeem common OP Units to the extent such valuations prove to not accurately reflect the realizable value of our assets. Because the price at which your 
 
 37 

Table of Contents 

 common OP Units may be redeemed by us is generally based on our prior calendar quarter s NAV per common OP Unit, you may receive less than realizable value for your investment. 
 Our NAV per common OP Unit may change materially if the appraised values of our properties materially change from prior appraisals, the actual operating results for a particular calendar quarter differ from what we originally budgeted for that quarter or if the value of a liability (contingent or otherwise) is determined to be different than initially anticipated. 
 Each of our properties will be appraised at least once per year. When these appraisals are considered by the General Partner for purposes of valuing the relevant property, there may be a material change in our NAV per common OP Unit from the value previously reported. In addition, actual operating results for a given calendar quarter may differ from what we originally budgeted for that quarter. It is also possible that we determine that we underestimated or overestimated the value of our existing liabilities (contingent or otherwise) in a prior calendar quarter. Any of the foregoing may cause a material increase or decrease in the NAV per common OP Unit for a subsequent calendar quarter. We will not retroactively adjust the NAV per common OP Unit reported for a previous calendar quarter. Therefore, because a new annual appraisal may differ materially from the prior appraisal, the actual results from operations may be better or worse than what we previously budgeted for a particular calendar quarter or because the value of our liabilities may be different than originally anticipated, the adjustment to take into consideration the new appraisal, actual operating results or new valuation of liabilities may cause the NAV per common OP Unit to increase or decrease, and such increase or decrease will occur only as of the end of the calendar quarter in which the adjustment is made. 
 It may be difficult to reflect, fully and accurately, material events that may impact our quarterly NAV per common OP Unit. 
 The General Partner s determination of our quarterly NAV per common OP Unit will be based in part on appraisals of each of our properties provided annually by independent third-party appraisal firms and reviewed by an independent valuation advisor, each in accordance with Valuation Policy. As a result, our published NAV per common OP Unit in any given calendar quarter may not fully reflect any or all changes in value that may have occurred since the most recent appraisal or valuation. The General Partner will review appraisal reports and is responsible for notifying the applicable independent valuation advisor of the occurrence of any property-specific or market-driven event it believes may cause a material valuation change in the real estate valuation, but it may be difficult to reflect fully and accurately rapidly changing market conditions or material events that may impact the value of our real estate or liabilities between valuations, or to obtain complete information regarding any such events in a timely manner. For example, an unexpected termination or renewal of a material lease, a material increase or decrease in vacancies or an unanticipated structural or environmental event at a property may cause the value of a property to change materially, yet obtaining sufficient relevant information after the occurrence has come to light and/or analyzing fully the financial impact of such an event may be difficult to do and may require some time. As a result, the NAV per common OP Unit may not reflect a material event until such time as sufficient information is available and analyzed, and the financial impact is fully evaluated, such that our NAV per common OP Unit may be appropriately adjusted in accordance with our Valuation Policy. Depending on the circumstance, the resulting potential disparity in our NAV per common OP Unit may be in favor or to the detriment of either unitholders who deliver a Notice of Redemption, or other existing unitholders. 
 NAV calculations are not governed by governmental or independent securities, financial or accounting rules or standards. 
 While we believe our NAV calculation methodologies are consistent with standard industry practices, there is no SEC or other regulatory agency rule or regulation that requires we calculate NAV, or the components used in calculation NAV, in a certain way. As a result, other companies in the real estate industry may use different methodologies or assumptions to determine NAV. 
 Further, there are no accounting rules or standards that prescribe which components should be used in calculating NAV, and our NAV per common OP Unit is not audited by our independent registered public accounting firm. We will calculate and publish NAV per common OP Unit quarterly solely for purposes of establishing the Value of a REIT Share and similar terms as set forth in our Partnership Agreement, including for purposes of redeeming common OP Units in accordance with the Partnership Agreement. You should not view our quarterly NAV per common OP Unit, on its own, as a measure of our historical or future financial condition or performance. The components and methodology used in calculating our NAV per common OP Unit may differ from those used by other companies now or in the future. 
 In addition, calculations of our NAV per common OP Unit, to the extent that they incorporate valuations of our assets and liabilities, are not prepared in accordance with GAAP. These valuations may differ from liquidation values that could be realized in the event that we were forced to sell assets.

Table of Contents 

 Additionally, errors may occur in calculating our NAV per common OP Unit, which could impact the price at which we redeem common OP Units. If such errors were to occur, the General Partner, depending on the circumstances surrounding each error and the extent of any impact the error has on the price at which common OP Units are redeemed, may determine in its sole discretion to take certain corrective actions in response to such errors, including making adjustments to prior NAV calculations. You should carefully review the disclosure of our Valuation Policy as described above and how NAV per common OP Unit will be calculated. 
 We may need to adjust the methodologies used in calculating NAV per common OP Unit in certain situations. 
 While the methodologies contained in our Valuation Policy are designed to operate reliably within a wide variety of circumstances, it is possible that in certain unanticipated situations or after the occurrence of certain extraordinary events (such as a significant disruption in relevant markets, a terrorist attack or an act of nature), our ability to calculate NAV per common OP unit may be impaired or delayed, including, without limitation, circumstances where there is a delay in accessing or receiving information from vendors or other reporting agents upon which we may rely upon in determining the quarterly value of our NAV. In these circumstances, a more accurate valuation of our NAV per common OP unit could be obtained by using different assumptions or methodologies. Accordingly, in special situations when, in the General Partner s reasonable judgment, the administration of the Valuation Policy would result in a valuation that does not represent a fair and accurate estimate of the value of our investment, alternative methodologies may be applied. 
 Our independent valuation advisor and/or independent third-party appraisers may have conflicts of interests and other relationships with us and our affiliates. 
 To the extent engaged, we expect to pay fees to our independent valuation advisor upon its delivery to us of its review reports. We also expect to agree to indemnify any independent valuation advisor against certain liabilities arising out of its engagement. 
 We expect that any independent valuation advisor and certain of the independent third-party appraisers we engage will have provided, and will be expected to continue to provide, real estate appraisal, appraisal management and real estate valuation advisory services to Blackstone and its affiliates and will have received, and would be expected to continue to receive, fees in connection with such services. We also expect that any independent valuation advisor and certain of the independent third-party appraisers we may engage, and their respective affiliates, may from time to time in the future perform other commercial real estate and financial advisory services for Blackstone and its affiliates, or in transactions related to the properties that are the subjects of the valuations being performed for us, or otherwise, so long as such other services do not adversely affect the independence of the independent valuation advisor or the applicable appraiser as certified in the applicable appraisal report. 
 We do not make any representations, warranties or guarantees regarding the accuracy of our NAV. 
 As described above, valuations and appraisals of our real estate are estimates of fair value and may not necessarily correspond to realizable value. Accordingly, we do not represent, warrant or guarantee that: 
 a unitholder would be able to realize the NAV per common OP unit for the common OP Units a unitholder owns if the unitholder attempts to sell its common OP Units; 
 a unitholder would ultimately realize distributions per common OP unit equal to the NAV per common OP unit for the common OP Units it owns upon liquidation of our assets and settlement of our liabilities or a sale of our company; 
 our common OP Units would trade at their NAV per common OP unit on a national securities exchange; 
 a third party would offer the NAV per common OP Unit in an arm s-length transaction to purchase all or substantially all of our common OP Units; or 
 the NAV per Common OP Unit would equate to a market price of an open-ended real estate fund.

 ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 
 The AIR Operating Partnership did not issue nor repurchase any unregistered OP units during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Repurchases of Equity Securities 
 The AIR Operating Partnership s Partnership Agreement generally provides that after holding common OP Units for one year, limited partners have the right to redeem their common OP Units for cash. Prior to the Merger, common OP Units that were being redeemed could instead, at our election, be redeemed for shares of AIR Common Stock on a one-for-one basis (subject to customary antidilution adjustments). In accordance with the Amendment No. 1 to the Partnership Agreement, which was adopted on June 25, 2024, following the closing of the Merger, the AIR Operating Partnership will pay only cash to those holders of units in the AIR Operating Partnership who elect to redeem their units in accordance with the terms of the Partnership Agreement (and will not exercise its right to pay for such redeemed units in the AIR Operating Partnership in shares of AIR s common stock). 
 The following table summarizes the AIR Operating Partnership s repurchases or redemptions of common OP Units in exchange for cash during the three months ended September 30, 2024: 
 Fiscal period Total Number of Units Repurchased Average Price Paid per Unit Total Number of Units Repurchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs Maximum Number of Units that May Yet Be Repurchased Under Plans or Programs (1) July 1 July 31, 2024 650,233 31.35 N/A N/A August 1 August 31, 2024 108,318 25.68 N/A N/A September 1 September 30, 2024 32,061 25.60 N/A N/A Total 790,612 30.34 
 (1) The terms of the AIR Operating Partnership s Partnership Agreement do not provide for a maximum number of OP Units that may be repurchased, and other than the express terms of its Partnership Agreement, the AIR Operating Partnership has no publicly announced plans or programs of repurchase. 
 For additional information regarding the calculation of NAV, please refer to Management's Discussion And Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Item 2. 
 Distribution Payments 
 On August 1, 2024, and in connection with the CMBS 1 Loan, AIR Operating Partnership paid a special cash distribution in an aggregate amount of 892.0 million to holders of record of common OP Units and LTIP units as of the close of business on July 31, 2024, representing a distribution of 5.80 per common OP Unit.
