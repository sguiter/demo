Point-in-time revenue recognition 

Total net sales 

The timing of revenue recognition,
billings, and cash collections results in billed accounts receivables, unbilled receivables (presented as deferred costs on our condensed
consolidated balance sheets) and customer advances and deposits (presented as deferred revenue on our condensed consolidated balance sheets),
where applicable. Amounts are generally billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed upon milestones. The over-time revenue recognition
model consists of non-recurring engineering NRE and prototype services and typically relates to NRE services related to
the evaluation, design or customization of a medical device and is typically recognized over time utilizing an input measure of progress
based on costs incurred compared to the estimated total costs upon completion. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
we recorded and , respectively, of revenue that had been included in deferred revenue in the prior year. The revenue recognized
from the contract liabilities consisted of satisfying our performance obligations during the normal course of business.

Total Investments 

Investments
at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 had an aggregate cost basis of million .
Both current and long-term marketable equity securities include equity securities of public companies that are thinly traded. We classified
certain investments as long-term in nature because if we decide to sell these securities, we may not be able to sell our position within
one year. At September 30, 2024, the investments included unrealized gains of million (gross
unrealized gains of million offset by gross unrealized losses of . At June 30, 2024, the investments included net
unrealized gains of million (gross unrealized gains of million offset by gross unrealized losses of ). 

 Of
the total marketable equity securities at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, and , respectively, represent an investment
in the common stock of Air T, Inc. Two of our Board members are also board members of Air T, Inc. and both either individually or through
affiliates, own an equity interest in Air T, Inc. Our Chairman, one of the two Board members aforementioned, also serves as the Chief
Executive Officer and Chairman of Air T, Inc. Another of our Board members is employed by Air T, Inc. as its Chief of Staff. The shares
were purchased through 10b5-1 Plans, that, in accordance with our internal policies regarding the approval of related-party transactions,
were approved by our then three Board members that are not affiliated with Air T, Inc. 

 We invest surplus
cash from time to time through our Investment Committee, which is comprised of one management director, Richard Rick Van
Kirk, and two non-management directors, Raymond Ray Cabillot and Nicholas Nick Swenson, who chairs the
committee. Both Nick and Ray are active investors with extensive portfolio management expertise. We leverage the experience of these committee
members to make investment decisions for our surplus operating capital or borrowed funds. Additionally, many of our securities holdings
include stocks of public companies that either Nick or Ray or both may own from time to time either individually or through the investment
funds that they manage, or other companies whose boards they sit on, such as Air T, Inc.

 We recognize accrued interest and penalties
related to unrecognized tax benefits when applicable. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized accrued interest of and
 , respectively, related to unrecognized tax benefits. Our effective tax rate for both the three months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, is and is slightly less than our combined expected federal and applicable state corporate income tax rates due primarily
to federal and state research credits. 

 We are subject to U.S. federal
income tax, as well as income tax of California and Colorado, as well as Massachusetts through fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. We are
currently open to audit under the statute of limitations by the Internal Revenue Service for the years ended June 30, 2021, and later. 
However, because of our prior net operating losses and research credit carryovers, our tax years from June 30, 2013, are open to audit.
 We do not anticipate a significant change to
 the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits within
the next 12 months. 

shares of our common stock in the form of incentive stock options, nonstatutory
stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted stock units, performance awards, and other stock-based awards. 

Performance Awards 

In December 2017, the Compensation
Committee of our Board of Directors granted performance awards to our employees under our 2016 Equity Incentive Plan, which will
generally be paid in shares of our common stock. Whether any performance awards vest, and the amount that does vest, is tied to the The weighted-average fair value of the performance awards granted was , calculated using the weighted-average fair market
value for each award, using a Monte Carlo simulation. In February 2020, the Compensation Committee reallocated previously forfeited
awards, having the same remaining terms and conditions, to certain employees. The weighted-average fair value of the performance awards
reallocated in 2020 was , calculated using the weighted-average fair market value for each award, using a Monte Carlo simulation.
In December 2021, the Compensation Committee reallocated an additional previously forfeited awards, having the same remaining terms
and conditions, to other employees. The weighted average fair value of the performance awards reallocated in 2021 was , calculated
using the weighted average fair market value for each award, using a Monte Carlo simulation. In October 2023, the Compensation Committee
reallocated an additional previously forfeited awards, having the same remaining terms and conditions, to other employees. The
weighted average fair value of the performance awards reallocated in 2023 was , calculated using the weighted average fair market
value for each award, using a Monte Carlo simulation. We recorded share-based compensation expense of and for the three
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to these performance awards. On September 30, 2024, there was approximately
 of unrecognized compensation cost related to these non-vested performance awards, which is expected to be expensed over the weighted-average
period of years. 

 On July 1, 2024, it was
determined by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors that the vesting of performance awards for shares of common
stock had been achieved. Each participant elected a net issuance to cover their individual withholding taxes and therefore we issued 
shares and paid of participant-related payroll tax liabilities. 

 Non-Qualified Stock Options 

 In December 2020, the Compensation
Committee of our Board of Directors granted non-qualified stock options to our directors and certain employees under the 2016
Equity Incentive Plan. We recorded compensation expense
of and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to these stock options. The weighted-average
fair value of the stock option awards granted was , calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation. As of September 30, 2024, none of
these stock options had vested and there was approximately million of unrecognized compensation cost related to these non-vested
stock options. 

 Employee Stock Purchase Plan 

 In September 2014, our Board
approved the establishment of an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP ). The ESPP conforms to the provisions of Section
423 of the Internal Revenue Code, has coterminous Our Board of Directors also approved the provision that shares formerly
reserved for issuance under former stock option plans in excess of shares issuable pursuant to outstanding options, aggregating 
shares, be reserved for issuance pursuant to the ESPP. The ESPP was approved by our shareholders at our 2014 Annual Meeting. 

In October 2023, our Board
approved an amendment to the ESPP (the ESPP Amendment ), which extended the term of the ESPP for an additional ten years
from January 2025 to January 2035. The ESPP Amendment was approved by our shareholders at our 2023 Annual Meeting. 

 During the three months

upon their contributions at discount prices of and , respectively, per share. As of September 30, 2024, on a cumulative

for the entirety of our fiscal year ending June 30, 2025, or any other interim period during such fiscal year. Our fiscal year ends on
June 30 and our fiscal quarters end on September 30, December 31, and March 31. Unless otherwise stated, all dates refer to our fiscal
year and those fiscal quarters. 

Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments 

 Our financial
statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates
and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates
on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which
form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates. 

 An accounting policy is
deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at
the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that
are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements. Management believes that there have been no significant
changes during the three months ended September 30, 2024, to the items that we disclosed as our critical accounting policies and estimates
in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our
fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. 

 Business Strategy and Future Plans 

 Our business today is almost entirely
driven by sales of our medical devices. Many of our significant customers place purchase orders for specific products that were developed
by us under various development and/or supply agreements. Our customers may request that we design and manufacture a custom surgical device
or they may hire us as a contract manufacturer to manufacture a product of their own design. In either case, we have extensive experience
with autoclavable, battery-powered and electric, multi-function surgical drivers, and shavers. We continue to focus a significant percentage
of our time and resources on providing outstanding products and service to our valued principal customers. During the first quarter of
fiscal 2021, our largest customer executed an amendment to our existing supply agreement such that we shall continue to supply their surgical
handpieces to them through calendar 2025. 

Simultaneously, we are working
to build top-line sales through active proposals of new medical device products with new and existing customers. Our patented adaptive
torque-limiting software has been very well received in the CMF and thoracic markets. 

In November 2020, we purchased
an approximate 25,000 square foot industrial building in Tustin, California (the Franklin
Property ). This building is located approximately four miles from our Irvine, California headquarters and was acquired to provide
us additional capacity for our expected continued future growth, including anticipated expanded capacity for the manufacture of batteries
and new products. We began operations in the new facility during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 and believe that the additional capacity
will allow for our continued expected growth. 

In summary, our current objectives
are focused primarily on maintaining our relationships with our current medical device customers, investing in research and development
activities to design unique medical devices as well as Pro-Dex branded drivers to leverage our torque-limiting software, expanding our
manufacturing capacity through the commencement of operations at the Franklin Property, and promoting active product development proposals
to new and existing customers for both orthopedic shavers and screw drivers for a multitude of surgical applications, while monitoring
closely the progress of all these individual endeavors. While we expect revenue growth in the future, it may not be a consistent trajectory
but rather periods of incremental growth that current expenditures are helping to create. However, there can be no assurance that we will
be successful in any of these objectives.

Our
medical device revenue increased 2.1 million, or 27 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period
of the prior fiscal year . Our orthopedic sales increased 1.9 million, or 38 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared
to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, due in part, to our largest customer requesting shipment of their next generation
handpiece, or end-effector, to satisfy quantities requested for a limited market release. We expect production shipments of this newest
generation to ramp up in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2025. Recurring revenue from distributors of CMF drivers increased 567,000,
or 35 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. While we do not have
much visibility into our customers distribution networks, this level of change (whether an increase or decrease) is not uncommon
and fluctuations occur based upon required inventory levels. Our thoracic sales decreased by 320,000, or 24 for the three months ended
September 30, 2024, compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. 

 Sales
of our compact pneumatic air motors increased 2,000, or 1 , for the three months ended September
30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The relatively flat sales volume is consistent with our lack of
substantive marketing efforts . Sales of our dental products and components increased
 3,000, or 8 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, which negligible
increase is expected given our prior disclosures that we are no longer pursuing this line of business. Our non-recurring engineering NRE and proto-type revenue decreased 142,000, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding
period of the prior fiscal year, due to a decline in billable contracts. Our NRE and proto-type revenue is typically a small percentage
of our total revenue and can vary significantly from quarter to quarter. 

 Repair
revenue increased by 1.1 million, or 28 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period of the prior
fiscal year, due to an increased number of repairs of the orthopedic handpiece we sell to our largest customer. This increase relates
to the continuation of the previously disclosed enhanced repair program. 

 Discounts
and other increased by 126,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, due
to volume rebates related to the orthopedic handpiece we sell to our largest customer, which they negotiated in conjunction with our contract
extension through 2025. 

 At September
30, 2024, we had a backlog of approximately
 56.8 million, of which 45.6 million is s cheduled for delivery during the remainder of fiscal 2025. Our backlog represents firm
purchase orders received and acknowledged from our customers and does not include all revenue expected to be generated from existing customer
contracts. We may experience
variability in our new order bookings due to various reasons, including, but not limited to, the timing of major new product launches
and customer planned inventory builds. However, we do not typically experience seasonal fluctuations 
in our shipments and revenues.

Cost of sales for the three
months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 1.5 million, or 18 , compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The
increase in cost of sales is consistent with the 25 increase in revenue for the same period. Product costs increased by 804,000, or
9 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, which is consistent
with higher revenue generated in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 we experienced under-absorption
of 325,000 in manufacturing costs compared to 285,000 over-absorption during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. We anticipate
growth in our direct labor costs this fiscal year such that our absorption will stabilize without the need to increase our labor and overhead
rates. Costs related to inventory and warranty charges increased 48,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the
corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, due primarily to an increase in warranty reserves. 

 Gross
profit increased by approximately 1.5 million, or 41 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period
of the prior fiscal year, and gross margin as a percentage of sales increased by four percentage points between such periods, primarily
as a result of a more favorable product mix of sales during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding
period of the prior fiscal year.

Selling expenses consist
of salaries and other personnel-related expenses in support of business development, as well as trade show attendance, advertising and
marketing expenses, and travel and related costs incurred in generating and maintaining our customer relationships. Selling expenses for
the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 23,000, or 92 , compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The
increase relates to recruiting fees related to an ongoing search for a director of business development. 

 General and administrative
expenses G A consist of salaries and other personnel-related expenses of our accounting, finance, and human resources
personnel, professional fees, directors fees, and other costs and expenses attributable to being a public company. G A expenses
increased by 251,000, or 25 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal
year. The increase in total G A expenses relates to higher payroll and personnel expenses including higher bonus accruals. 

Research and development costs
generally consist of compensation and other personnel-related costs of our engineering and support personnel, related professional and
consulting fees, patent-related fees, lab costs, materials, and travel and related costs incurred in the development and support of our
products. Research and development costs increased 38,000, or 5 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding
period of the prior fiscal year. The increase is due primarily to an increase in internal project spending and a reduction in billable
project offsets, partially offset by a reduction in personnel-related expenses. 

The majority of our research
and development costs relate to sustaining activities related to products we currently manufacture and sell. As we introduce new products
into the market, we expect to see an increase in sustaining and other engineering expenses. Typical examples of sustaining engineering
activities include, but are not limited to, end-of-life component replacement, especially in electronic components found in our printed
circuit board assemblies, analysis of customer complaint data to improve process and design, replacement and enhancement of tooling and
fixtures used in the machine shop, assembly operations, and inspection areas to improve efficiency and through-put. 

 Other Income (Expense), Net 

 Interest and Dividend Income 

 The interest and dividend income
recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, consists primarily of interest and dividends from our investments
and money market accounts. 

 Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Investments 

 The unrealized gain or (loss)
on marketable securities for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, relates to our portfolio of investments described more fully
in Note 4 to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. 

 Interest Expense 

 The interest expense recorded
during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, relates to our Minnesota Bank and Trust MBT loans described
more fully in Note 10 to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. 

 Income Tax Expense 

 The effective tax rate
for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, is 26 . and is slightly less than our combined expected federal and applicable
state corporate income tax rates due primarily to federal and state research credits. 

Liquidity and Capital
Resources 

 Cash and cash equivalents
at September 30, 2024 increased 450,000 to 3.1 million as compared to 2.6 million at June 30, 2024. The following table includes a summary
of our condensed statements of cash flows contained elsewhere in this report.

Operating Activities 

 Net cash provided by operating
activities during the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 1.9 million. Our net income was 2.5 million, which includes 433,000
of unrealized gains on our marketable securities as well as non-cash depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation in the
amount of 302,000 and 113,000, respectively. Additionally, our inventory and income taxes payable increased by 1.3 million and 209,000,
respectively. Offsetting these outflows of cash, our accounts receivable decreased by 428,000 and accounts payable and accrued expenses
increased by 579,000. 

 Net cash provided by operating
activities during the three months ended September 30, 2023 totaled 392,000. This is primarily because our net loss of 615,000 for the
three months ended September 30, 2023 included non-cash unrealized loss on investments, share-based compensation and depreciation and
amortization of 2.6 million, 188,000 and 283,000, respectively. Uses of cash arose primarily from an increase in accounts receivable
of 1.1 million related to increased sales and our increase in income tax assets of 873,000. 

Investing Activities 

 Net cash used in investing
activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 431,000 and related to the purchase of equipment and improvements. 

 Net cash used in investing
activities for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was 126,000 and related to the purchase of equipment and improvements. 

 Financing Activities 

 Net cash used in financing
activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included the repurchase of 2.3 million of common stock pursuant to our share
repurchase program, and proceeds of 5.0 million from a new term loan from MBT, offset by principal payments totaling 3.4 million. Additionally,
we paid 273,000 of employee payroll taxes related to the award of 40,000 shares of common stock to employees under previously granted
performance awards. 

 Net cash used in financing
activities for the three months ended September 30, 2023 included principal payments of 1.3 million on our loans from MBT, which included
a 1.0 million payment against our revolving loan. 

Financing Facilities Liquidity Requirements for the Next
Twelve Months 

 As of September 30, 2024, our
working capital was 27.2 million. We currently believe that our existing cash and cash equivalent balances together with our accounts
receivable balances will provide us sufficient funds to satisfy our cash requirements as our business is currently conducted for at least
the next 12 months. In addition to our cash and cash equivalent balances, we expect to derive a portion of our liquidity from our
cash flows from operations. 

We are focused on preserving our
cash balances by monitoring expenses, identifying cost savings, and investing only in those development programs and products that we
believe will most likely contribute to our profitability. As we execute on our current strategy, however, we may require debt and/or equity
capital to fund our working capital needs and requirements for capital equipment to support our manufacturing and inspection processes.
In particular, we have experienced negative operating cash flow in the past, especially as we procure long-lead time materials to satisfy
our backlog, which can be subject to extensive variability. We believe that if we need additional capital to fund our operations, we can
borrow against our MBT revolver. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
 ABOUT MARKET RISK 

 Not

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

 Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

 Our
 Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (our
principal financial officer and principal accounting officer) have concluded based on their evaluation as of September 30, 2024, that
our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended Exchange Act )) are not effective due to a material weakness. The term disclosure
controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act, means controls and other procedures of a company
 that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by the
company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, 
 summarized and reported, within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures also include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company
in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act
 is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal
executive officer and principal financial officer and principal accounting officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

 A
material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company s annual and interim financial statements will not be detected
or prevented on a timely basis. A material weakness was discovered relating to controls related to the existence of inventory during fiscal
2024 and as of September 30, 2024, we are continuing to remediate this weakness. While we believe that our inventory exists and is accurately
recorded and properly valued at September 30, 2024, we are continuing to expand our internal controls over the existence of inventory
and have hired a warehouse manager in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 to ensure that we successfully implement effective standard operating
procedures, provide adequate training to stockroom personnel, and continue our cycle count procedures. 

Internal
Control over Financial Reporting 

 During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially 
affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 

 Inherent Limitations
on the Effectiveness of Controls 

 In designing and evaluating
our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any system of controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, as ours are designed to do, and management
necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 

 Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
