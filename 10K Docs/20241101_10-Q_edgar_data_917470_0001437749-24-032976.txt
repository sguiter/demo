million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. The allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level considered appropriate based on historical experience, specific customer collection issues that have been identified, current market conditions and estimates for supportable forecasts when appropriate.

share s of common stock have been authorized for equity grants. On an annual basis, the compensation committee of the Company s Board of Directors awards RSs or RSUs to each non-employee director as part of their annual compensation. 
 
 The annual award f or 2024 per director was of RSs. Subject to the terms of the Incentive Plan and the RS agreement, one - third of the RSs vest on each December 31, 2024, December 31, 2025 and December 31, 2026. The grantee will not be entitled to vote on the RSs or receive dividends with respect to RSs until they vest. 
 
 T he annual award for 2023 per director was 80,000 of RSUs. Subject to the terms of the Incentive Plan and the RSU agreement, the 2023 RSUs vest after one year of service (from the date of grant). The RSUs are not converted into shares of common stock until the director either resigns or is terminated from the Company's Board of Directors. 

In January 2022 , the Company adopted a new C-Suite Long-Term Incentive Plan (the C-Suite Plan) that operates under the Senior Manager Stock Incentive Plan. Under the C-Suite Plan, the Chief Executive Officer, the President and Chief Operating Officer and the Chief Financial Officer are eligible for participation. In each calendar year, the Committee may award eligible participants a long-term incentive of both a RSU grant and a performance stock units (PSU) grant. Additionally, the Committee may offer a long-term cash incentive (split equally between service and performance-based portions) to supplement both the RSU and PSU grants in order to arrive at the total long-term award target. For 2024 , the total long-term award target is million for the Chief Executive Officer, million for t he President and Chief Operating Officer and million for the Chief Financial Officer. For 2023 , the total long-term award target was million for the Chief Executive Officer, million for the President and Chief Operating Officer and million for the Chief Financial Officer. The PSUs will vest if the return on net assets, calculated as EBITDA divided by Average Accounts Receivable, Inventory and Property and Equipment, exce eds five perce nt. Each RSU and service-based cash incentive vests three years after the grant date. Each vested RSU will convert into the right to receive one share of common stock. During 2024 , a total of RSUs and PSUs were granted to the participants under the C-Suite Plan, and and , respectively, were granted in service-based and performance-based cash awards. During 2023 , a total of RSUs and PSUs were granted to the participants under the C-Suite Plan, and million and million, respectively, were granted in service-based and performance-based cash awards. If the return on net assets falls below 5 percent, no performance-based incentive will be awarded. The maximum performance-based award is achieved if return on net assets exceeds ten percent, and is capped at of the grant. 
 
 Stock-based compensation expense recognized on RSUs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, is summarized in the following table:

million , or , compared to an income tax provision of million , or , for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company recorded an income tax provision of million, or , compared to an income tax provision of million, or , for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . 
 
 The tax provision for the interim period is determined using an estimate of the Company s annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items that are taken into account in the relevant period. Each quarter, the Company updates the estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if the estimated tax rate changes, the Company makes a cumulative adjustment. 
 
 The quarterly tax provision and the quarterly estimate of the annual effective tax rate is subject to significant volatility due to several factors, including variability in accurately predicting the Company s pre-tax and taxable income and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in law and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Additionally, the effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on the effective tax rate is greater when pre-tax income is lower.

 Overview 
 
 We are a leading metals service center focused on the direct sale and value-added processing of carbon and coated sheet, plate and coil products; stainless steel sheet, plate, bar and coil; aluminum sheet, plate and coil; pipe, tube bar, valves and fittings, tin plate and metal-intensive end-use products. We provide metals processing and distribution services for a wide range of customers. We operate in three reportable segments: specialty metals flat products, carbon flat products, and tubular and pipe products. Our specialty metals flat products segment's focus is on the direct sale and distribution of processed aluminum and stainless flat-rolled sheet and coil products, flat bar products, prime tin mill products and fabricated parts. Through acquisitions, our specialty metals flat products segment has expanded its geographical footprint and enhanced its product offerings in stainless steel and aluminum plate, sheet, angles, rounds, flat bar, tube and pipe and the manufacturing and distribution of stainless steel bollards and water treatment systems. Our carbon flat products segment's focus is on the direct sale and distribution of large volumes of processed carbon and coated flat-rolled sheet, coil and plate products and fabricated parts. Through acquisitions, our carbon flat products segment has expanded its product offerings to include self-dumping metal hoppers and steel and stainless-steel dump inserts for pickup truck and service truck beds. Through the acquisition of Metal-Fab, Inc., or Metal-Fab, on January 3, 2023, the carbon flat products segment further expanded its product offerings to include venting, micro air and clean air products for residential, commercial and industrial applications. Our tubular and pipe products segment's focus is on the distribution of metal tubing, pipe, bar, valves and fittings and the fabrication of parts supplied to various industrial markets. Through the acquisition of Central Tube and Bar, or CTB, on October 2, 2023, the tubular and pipe products segment further expanded its geographic footprint and extended its value-added contract manufacturing capabilities. We also perform toll processing of customer-owned metals. We sell certain products internationally, primarily in Canada and Mexico. International sales are immaterial to our consolidated financial results and to the individual segments' results.

Our results of operations are affected by numerous external factors including, but not limited to: metals pricing, demand and availability the availability, and increased costs of labor global supply, the level of metals imported into the United States, tariffs, and inventory held in the supply chain general and global business, economic, financial, banking and political conditions competition layoffs or work stoppages by our own, our suppliers or our customers personnel; fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar to foreign currencies; transportation and energy costs pricing and availability of raw materials used in the production of metals and customers ability to manage their credit line availability. The metals industry also continues to be affected by the addition of new capacity and the global consolidation of our suppliers, competitors and end-use customers. 
 
 Like other metals service centers, we maintain substantial inventories of metals to accommodate the short lead times and just-in-time delivery requirements of our customers. Accordingly, we purchase metals in an effort to maintain our inventory at levels that we believe to be appropriate to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based upon customer forecasts, historic buying practices, supply agreements with customers and market conditions. Our commitments to purchase metals are generally at prevailing market prices in effect at the time we place our orders. From time to time, we have entered into pass-through nickel swaps at the request of our customers in order to mitigate our customers risk of volatility in the price of metals. We have no long-term, fixed-price metals purchase contracts. When metals prices decline, customer demands for lower prices and our competitors responses to those demands could result in lower sale prices and, consequently, lower gross profits and earnings as we use existing metals inventory. When metals prices increase, competitive conditions will influence how much of the price increase we can pass on to our customers. To the extent we are unable to pass on future price increases in our raw materials to our customers, the net sales and gross profits of our business could be adversely affected. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we employed approximately 2,148 people. Approximately 239 of the hourly plant personnel at the facilities listed below are represented by seven separate collective bargaining units. The table below shows the expiration dates of the collective bargaining agreements.

We have never experienced a work stoppage and we believe that our relationship with employees is good. However, any prolonged work stoppages by our personnel represented by collective bargaining units could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 Reportable Segments 
 
 We operate in three reportable segments: specialty metals flat products, carbon flat products and tubular and pipe products. The specialty metals flat products segment and the carbon flat products segment are at times consolidated and referred to as the flat products segment. Some of the flat products segments assets and resources are shared by the specialty metals and carbon flat products segments and both segments products are stored in the shared facilities and, in some locations, processed on shared equipment. As such, total assets and capital expenditures are reported in the aggregate for the flat products segments. Due to the shared assets and resources, certain of the flat products segment expenses are allocated between the specialty metals flat products segment and the carbon flat products segment based upon an established allocation methodology. 
 
 We follow the accounting guidance that requires the utilization of a management approach to define and report the financial results of operating segments. The management approach defines operating segments along the lines used by the chief operating decision maker, or CODM, to assess performance and make operating and resource allocation decisions. Our CODM evaluates performance and allocates resources based primarily on operating income. Our operating segments are based primarily on internal management reporting.

Table of Contents 

Due to the nature of the products sold in each segment, there are significant differences in the segments average selling price and the cost of materials sold. The specialty metals flat products segment generally has the highest average selling price among the three segments followed by the tubular and pipe products segment and carbon flat products segment. Due to the nature of the tubular and pipe products, we do not report tons sold or per ton information. Gross profit per ton is generally higher in the specialty metals flat products segment than the carbon flat products segment. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales is generally higher in the tubular and pipe products and specialty metals flat products segments than the carbon flat products segment. Due to the differences in average selling prices, gross profit and gross profit percentage among the segments, a change in the mix of sales could impact total net sales, gross profit, and gross profit percentage. In addition, certain inventory in the tubular and pipe products segment is valued under the LIFO method. Adjustments to the LIFO inventory value are recorded to cost of materials sold and may impact the gross margin and gross margin percentage at the consolidated Company and tubular and pipe products segment levels. 
 
 Specialty metals flat products 
 
 The primary focus of our specialty metals flat products segment is on the direct sale and distribution of processed aluminum and stainless flat-rolled sheet and coil products, flat bar products, prime tin mill products and fabricated parts. Through acquisitions, our specialty metals flat products segment has expanded its geographical footprint and enhanced its product offerings in stainless steel and aluminum plate, sheet, angles, rounds, flat bar, tube and pipe and the manufacturing and distribution of stainless steel bollards and water treatment systems. We act as an intermediary between metals producers and manufacturers that require processed metals for their operations. We serve customers in various industries, including manufacturers of food service and commercial appliances, agriculture equipment, transportation and automotive equipment. We distribute these products primarily through a direct sales force. 
 
 Carbon flat products 
 
 The primary focus of our carbon flat products segment is on the direct sale and distribution of large volumes of processed carbon and coated flat-rolled sheet, coil and plate products and fabricated parts. Through acquisitions, our carbon flat products segment has expanded its product offerings to include self-dumping hoppers and steel and stainless-steel dump inserts for pickup truck and service truck beds. Through the acquisition of Metal-Fab on January 3, 2023, the carbon flat products segment further expanded its product offerings to include venting, micro air and clean air products for residential, commercial and industrial applications. We act as an intermediary between metals producers and manufacturers that require processed metals for their operations. We serve customers in most metals consuming industries, including manufacturers and fabricators of transportation and material handling equipment, construction and farm machinery, storage tanks, environmental and energy generation equipment, automobiles, military vehicles and equipment, as well as general and plate fabricators and metals service centers. We distribute these products primarily through a direct sales force. 
 
 Combined, the carbon and specialty metals flat products segments have 36 strategically-located processing and distribution facilities in the United States and one in Monterrey, Mexico. Many of our facilities service both the carbon and the specialty metals flat products segments, and certain assets and resources are shared by the segments. Our geographic footprint allows us to focus on regional customers and larger national and multi-national accounts, primarily located throughout the midwestern, eastern and southern United States. 
 
 Tubular and pipe products 
 
 The primary focus of our tubular and pipe products segment is on the distribution of metal tubing, pipe, bar, valve and fittings and the fabrication of pressure parts supplied to various industrial markets. Through the acquisition of CTB on October 2, 2023, the tubular and pipe products segment further expanded its geographic footprint and extended its value-added contract manufacturing capabilities. The tubular and pipe products segment operates from 10 locations in the Midwestern and Southern United States. The tubular and pipe products segment distributes its products primarily through a direct sales force. 
 
 Corporate expenses 
 
 Corporate expenses are reported as a separate line item for segment reporting purposes. Corporate expenses include the unallocated expenses related to managing the entire Company (i.e., all three segments), including compensation for certain personnel, expenses related to being a publicly traded entity such as board of directors expenses, audit expenses, and various other professional fees.

Results of Operations 
 
 Our results of operations are impacted by the market price of metals. Metals prices fluctuate significantly and changes to our net sales, cost of materials sold, gross profit, cost of inventory and profitability, are all impacted by industry metals pricing. Index pricing on carbon steel decreased during the third quarter of 2024 by 2.7 , and decreased during the first nine months of 2024 by 40.3 . Hot rolled coil index prices were 1.1 lower in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 . Metals prices in our specialty metals flat-products segment decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , primarily due to a 7.8 decrease in stainless steel surcharges . The average price of stainless surcharges decreased 27.5 during the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 Transactional or spot selling prices generally move in tandem with market price changes, while fixed selling prices typically lag and reset quarterly. Similarly, inventory costs (and, therefore, cost of materials sold) tend to move slower than market selling price changes due to mill lead times and inventory turnover impacting the rate of change in average cost. When average selling prices decrease, and net sales decrease, gross profit and operating expenses as a percentage of net sales will generally increase.

 Net sales decreased 56.4 million, or 10.7 , to 470.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 from 526.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. Specialty metals flat products net sales were 26.7 of total net sales in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 25.2 of total net sales in the third quarter of 2023. Carbon flat products net sales were 56.4 of total net sales in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 57.8 of total net sales in the third quarter of 2023. Tubular and pipe produc ts net sales were 16.9 of total net sales in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 16.9 of total net sales in the third quarter of 2023 . The decrease in net sales was due to a consolidated 10.8 decrease in average selling prices during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 partially offset by a 0.1 increase in sales volume. 
 
 Net sales decreased 145.9 million, or 8.7 , to 1.5 billion in the first nine months of 2024 from 1.7 billion in the first nine months of 2023. Specialty metals flat products net sales were 25.4 of total net sales in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 26.7 of total net sales in the first nine months of 2023. Carbon flat products net sales were 57.4 of total net sales in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 56.4 of total net sales in the first nine months of 2023. Tubular and pipe produc ts net sales were 17.3 of total net sales in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 16.9 of total net sales in the first nine months of 2023 . The decrease in net sales was due to a consolidated 9.8 decrease in average selling prices during the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 partially offset by a 1.2 increase in sales volume. 
 
 Cost of materials sold decreased 51.3 million, or 12.4 , to 363.1 million in the third quarter of 2024 from 414.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. Cost of materials sold decreased 131.8 million, or 10.1 , to 1.2 billion in the first nine months of 2024 from 1.3 billion in the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in cost of materials sold in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 is related to the decreased metals pricing discussed above in Results of Operations.

Table of Contents 

As a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (b) in the table above) increased to 22.7 in the third quarter of 2024 from 21.3 in the third quarter of 2023. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (b) in the table above) increased to 22.7 in the first nine months of 2024 from 21.6 in the first nine months of 2023. The increase in the gross profit as a percentage of net sales is due to the average cost of inventory decreasing more than the average selling prices. 
 
 Operating expenses in the third quarter of 2024 increased 8.0 million, or 8.8 , to 99.0 million from 91.1 million in the third quarter of 2023. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses increased to 21.0 for the third quarter of 2024 from 17.3 in the third quarter of 2023. Operating expenses in the specialty metals flat products segment increased 0.8 million, operating expenses in the carbon flat products segment increased 4.3 million, operating expenses in the tubular and pipe products segment increased 2.6 million and Corporate expenses increased 0.3 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third q uarter of 2023 . The increase in operating expenses on a dollar basis was primarily attributable to the inclusion of CTB operating expenses in 2024 and the year-over-year absence of employee retention credits partially offset by lower variable performance-based compensation. 
 
 Operating expenses in the first nine months of 2024 increased 11.4 million , or 3.9 , to 306.8 million from 295.4 million in the first nine months of 2023 . As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses increased to 20.1 for the first nine months of 2024 from 17.7 in the first nine months of 2023 . Operating expenses in the specialty metals flat products segment decreased 0.4 million, operating expenses in the carbon flat products segment increased 5.1 million, operating expenses in the tubular and pipe products segment increased 9.7 million and Corporate expenses decreased 3.1 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 . The increase in operating expenses on a dollar basis was primarily attributable to the inclusion of CTB operating expenses in 2024 and the year-over-year absence of employee retention credits partially offset by lower variable performance-based compensation and the year-over-year absence of acquisition-related expenses. 
 
 Interest and ot her expense on debt totaled 3.9 million, or 0.9 of net sales, in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 4.0 million, or 0.8 of net sales, in the third quarter of 2023 . Interest and ot her expense on debt totaled 12.3 million, or 0.9 of net sales, in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 12.4 million, or 0.8 of net sales, in the first nine months of 2023 . The decrease in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 was due to lower average borrowings partially offset by a higher effective borrowing rate. Our effective borrowing rate, exclusive of deferred financing fees and commitment fees, was 7.0 for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 5.9 for the first nine months of 2023 , primarily due to the expiration of an interest rate hedge in January 2024. 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, income before income taxes totaled 3.9 million compared to income before income taxes of 16.9 million in the third quarter of 2023. In the first nine months of 2024, income before income taxes totaled 26.5 million compared to income before income taxes of 51.9 million in the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 An income tax provision of 29.9 was recorded for the third quarter of 2024, compared to an income tax provision of 27.7 for the third quarter of 2023. An income tax provision of 28.0 was recorded for the first nine months of 2024, compared to an income tax provision of 28.5 for the first nine months of 2023. Our tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items that are considered in the relevant period. Each quarter, we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if our estimated tax rate changes, we make a cumulative adjustment. 
 
 Net income for the third quarter of 2024 totaled 2.7 million, or 0.23 per basic share and diluted share, compared to net income of 12.2 million, or 1.06 per basic and diluted share, for the third quarter of 2023. Net income for the first nine months of 2024 totaled 19.1 million, or 1.64 per basic share and diluted share, compared to net income of 37.1 million, or 3.21 per basic and diluted share, for the first nine months of 2023.

 Net sales decreased 9.7 million, or 10.9 , to 79.5 million in the third quarter of 2024 from 89.2 million in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease is a result of a 16.1 decrease in average selling prices partially offset by a 6.2 increase in shipping volume during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. The shipping volume increase is due to the CTB acquisition on October 2, 2023.

Liquidity, Capital Resources and Cash Flows 
 
 Our principal capital requirements include funding working capital needs, purchasing, upgrading and acquiring processing equipment and facilities, making acquisitions and paying dividends. We use cash generated from operations and borrowings under our ABL Credit Facility to fund these requirements. 
 
 We believe that funds available under our ABL Credit Facility, together with funds generated from operations, will be sufficient to provide us with the liquidity necessary to fund anticipated working capital requirements, capital expenditure requirements, our dividend payments, and any share repurchases and business acquisitions over at least the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter. In the future, we may, as part of our business strategy, acquire and dispose of assets or other companies in the same or complementary lines of business, or enter into or exit strategic alliances and joint ventures. Accordingly, the timing and size of our capital requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise. 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated 19.1 million of net cash from operations, of which 44.8 million was generated from operating activities and 25.7 million was used for working capital requirements. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we generated 121.0 million of net cash from operations, of which 67.2 million was generated from operating activities and 53.8 million was generated from working capital. 
 
 Net cash from operating activities totaled 44.8 million during the first nine months of 2024 and was mainly comprised of net income of 19.1 million, the non-cash depreciation and amortization addback of 22.4 million, and changes in other long-term liabilities of 6.6 million partially offset by changes in other long-term assets of 5.0 million. Net cash from operations totaled 67.2 million during the first nine months of 2023 and was mainly comprised of net income of 37.1 million, the non-cash depreciation and amortization addback of 19.4 million, decreases in other long-term assets of 5.3 million and changes in other long-term liabilities of 4.2 million. 
 
 Working capital at September 30, 2024 totaled 445.5 million, a 22.5 million increase from December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to a 12.9 million increase in inventory, a 6.4 million increase in accounts receivable and a 10.0 million decrease in accrued payroll and other accrued liabilities partially offset by a 4.4 million decrease in accounts payable. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used for investing activities totaled 22.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and primarily consisted of capital expenditures. Net cash used for investing activities totaled 148.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and primarily consisted of 129.5 million for the acquisition of Metal-Fab, inclusive of cash acquired of 1.7 million, and 19.6 million in capital expenditures partially offset by 0.1 million in proceeds from the disposition of property and equipment. 
 
 The capital expenditures in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 were primarily attributable to additional processing equipment at our existing facilities. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 During the first nine months of 2024, 1.0 million of cash was generated from financing activities, which primarily consisted of 7.1 million of net borrowings under our ABL Credit Facility, offset by 5.0 million of dividends paid, 0.9 million of principal payments under finance lease obligations and 0.1 million of credit facility fees and expenses related to the amended ABL Credit Facility. During the first nine months ended of 2023, 24.8 million was generated from financing activities, which primarily consisted of 30.9 million of net borrowings under our ABL Credit Facility, 4.2 million of dividends paid, 1.1 million of credit facility fees and expenses related to amending the ABL Credit Facility and 0.7 million of principle payments under finance lease obligations. 
 
 Dividends paid were 5.0 million and 4.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. In November 2024, our Board of Directors approved a regular quarterly dividend of 0.150 per share, which will be paid on December 16, 2024 to shareholders of record as of December 2, 2024. Regular dividend distributions in the future are subject to the availability of cash, the 15.0 million annual limitation on cash dividends and common stock repurchases under our ABL Credit Facility and continuing determination by our Board of Directors that the payment of dividends remains in the best interest of our shareholders.

Stock Repurchase Program 
 
 In 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to 550,000 shares of our issued and outstanding common stock, which could include open market repurchases, negotiated block transactions, accelerated stock repurchases or open market solicitations for shares, all or some of which may be effected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. Repurchased shares will be held in our treasury, or canceled and retired as our Board of Directors may determine from time to time. Any repurchases of common stock are subject to the covenants contained in the ABL Credit Facility. Under the ABL Credit Facility, we may repurchase common stock and pay dividends up to 15.0 million in the aggregate during any trailing twelve months without restrictions. Purchases in excess of 15.0 million require us to (i) maintain availability in excess of 20 of the aggregate revolver commitments 125.0 million at September 30, 2024) or (ii) to maintain availability equal to or greater than 15 of the aggregate revolver commitments 93.8 million at September 30, 2024) and we must maintain a pro forma ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, minus certain capital expenditures and cash taxes paid to fixed charges of at least 1.00 to 1.00. The timing and amount of any repurchases under the stock repurchase program will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and limitations under the ABL Credit Facility, and repurchases may be discontinued at any time. As of September 30, 2024, 360,212 shares remain authorized for repurchase under the program. 
 
 There were no shares repurchased during 2024 or 2023. 
 
 At- the-Market Equity Program 
 
 On September 3, 2021, we commenced an at-the-market, or ATM, equity program under our shelf registration statement, which allows us to sell and issue up to 50 million in shares of our common stock from time to time. We entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement on September 3, 2021 with KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., or KeyBanc, relating to the issuance and sale of shares of common stock pursuant to the program. KeyBanc is not required to sell any specific amount of securities but will act as our sales agent using commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales practices, on mutually agreed terms between KeyBanc and us. KeyBanc will be entitled to compensation for shares sold pursuant to the program of 2.0 of the gross proceeds of any shares of common stock sold under the Equity Distribution Agreement. No shares were sold under the ATM program during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or September 30, 2023. 
 
 Debt Arrangements 
 
 Our ABL Credit Facility is collateralized by our accounts receivable, inventory, personal property and certain real estate. The 625 million ABL Credit Facility consists of: (i) a revolving credit facility of up to 595 million, including a 20 million sub-limit for letters of credit, and (ii) a first in, last out revolving credit facility of up to 30 million. Under the terms of the ABL Credit Facility we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request additional commitments under the revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of up to 200 million to the extent that existing or new lenders agree to provide such additional commitments. The ABL Credit Facility matures on June 16, 2026. 
 
 The ABL Credit Facility contains customary representations and warranties and certain covenants that limit our ability to, among other things: (i) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness (ii) pay distributions on, redeem or repurchase capital stock or redeem or repurchase subordinated debt (iii) make investments (iv) sell assets (v) enter into agreements that restrict distributions or other payments from restricted subsidiaries to us (vi) incur liens securing indebtedness (vii) consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of their assets and (viii) engage in transactions with affiliates. In addition, the ABL Credit Facility contains a financial covenant which requires if any commitments or obligations are outstanding and the our availability is less than the greater of 30 million or 10.0 of the aggregate amount of revolver commitments 62.5 million at September 30, 2024) or 10.0 of the aggregate borrowing base 50.6 million at September 30, 2024), then we must maintain a ratio of Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) minus certain capital expenditures and cash taxes paid to fixed charges of at least 1.00 to 1.00 for the most recent twelve fiscal month period. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with our covenants and had approximately 304 million of availability under the ABL Credit Facility. 
 
 We have the option to borrow under its revolver based on the agent s base rate plus a premium ranging from 0.00 to 0.25 or the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, plus a premium ranging from 1.25 to 2.75 . 
 
 On August 15, 2024, we entered into a two-year forward starting fixed rate interest rate hedge in order to eliminate the variability of cash interest payments on 75 million of the outstanding SOFR based borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility. The interest rate hedge fixed the rate at 3.82 . Although we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the interest rate hedge agreement, we anticipate performance by the counterparty. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 1.2 million and 1.7 million, respectively, of bank financing fees were included in Prepaid expenses and other and Other long-term assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The financing fees are being amortized over the five-year term of the ABL Credit Facility and are included in Interest and other expense on debt on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on the consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. We monitor and evaluate our estimates and assumptions, based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 
 We review our financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting practices quarterly to ensure they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. For further information regarding the accounting policies that we believe to be critical accounting policies that affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Our principal raw materials are carbon, coated and stainless steel, aluminum, pipe and tube, flat rolled coil, sheet and plate that we typically purchase from multiple primary metals producers. The metals industry as a whole is cyclical and, at times, pricing and availability of metals can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond our control, including general domestic and international economic conditions, the levels of metals imported into the United States, labor costs, sales levels, competition, levels of inventory held by other metals service centers, consolidation of metals producers, new global capacity by metals producers, higher raw material costs for the producers of metals, import duties and tariffs and currency exchange rates. This volatility can significantly affect the availability and cost of raw materials for us. 
 
 We, like many other metals service centers, maintain substantial inventories of metals to accommodate the short lead times and just in time delivery requirements of our customers. Accordingly, we purchase metals in an effort to maintain our inventory at levels that we believe to be appropriate to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based upon historic buying practices, supply agreements with customers and market conditions. Our commitments to purchase metals are generally at prevailing market prices in effect at the time we place our orders. We have no long term, fixed price metals purchase contracts. When metals prices increase, competitive conditions will influence how much of the price increase we can pass on to our customers. To the extent we are unable to pass on future price increases in our raw materials to our customers, the net sales and profitability of our business could be adversely affected. When metals prices decline, customer demands for lower prices and our competitors responses to those demands could result in lower sale prices and, consequently, lower gross profits and inventory lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments as we sell existing inventory. Significant or rapid declines in metals prices or reductions in sales volumes could adversely impact our ability to remain in compliance with certain financial covenants in the ABL credit facility, as well as result in us incurring inventory or intangible asset impairment charges. Changing metals prices therefore could significantly impact our net sales, gross profits, operating income and net income. 
 
 Rising metals prices result in higher working capital requirements for us and our customers. Some customers may not have sufficient credit lines or liquidity to absorb significant increases in the price of metals. While we have generally been successful in the past in passing on producers price increases and surcharges to our customers, there is no guarantee that we will be able to pass on price increases to our customers in the future. Declining metals prices have generally adversely affected our net sales and net income, while increasing metals prices have generally favorably affected our net sales and net income. 
 
 Approximately 48 and 50 , respectively, of our consolidated net sales during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 were directly related to industrial machinery and equipment manufacturers and their fabricators. 
 
 Inflation generally affects us by increasing the cost of employee wages and benefits, transportation services, energy, borrowings under our credit facility, processing equipment, and purchased metals. General inflation, including increases in the price of metals and increased labor and distribution expense, did not materially effect our operations during the third quarter of 2024, and it has not had a material effect on our financial results during the last two years, but may have a significant impact in future years. 
 
 We are exposed to the impact of fluctuating metals prices and interest rate changes. During 2024 and 2023, we entered into metals swaps at the request of customers. These derivatives have not been designated as hedging instruments. For certain customers, we enter into contractual relationships that entitle us to pass through the economic effect of trading positions that we take with other third parties on our customers behalf. 
 
 Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from variable rate debt. On August 15, 2024, we entered into a two-year forward starting fixed rate interest rate hedge in order to eliminate the variability of cash interest payments on 75 million of the outstanding SOFR based borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility. The interest rate hedge fixed the rate at 3.82 . On January 10, 2019, we entered into a five-year forward starting interest fixed rate interest rate hedge in order to eliminate the variability of cash interest payments on 75m of the outstanding LIBOR based borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility. On January 3, 2023, we amended the interest rate hedge agreement to use SOFR as the reference rate and updated the fixed rate to 2.42 from 2.57 . This interest rate hedge agreement ended on January 10, 2024. We have the option to enter into 30- to 180-day fixed base rate SOFR loans under the ABL Credit Facility.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 The evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q has been carried out under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. These disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports that are filed with or submitted to the SEC is: (i) accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and (ii) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the third quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
