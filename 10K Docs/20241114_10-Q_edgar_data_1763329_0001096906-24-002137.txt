This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, particularly those under Risk Factors. 
 
 CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 under Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Forward-looking statements include statements with respect to our beliefs, plans, objectives, goals, expectations, anticipations, assumptions, estimates, intentions and future performance, and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may be beyond our control, and which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical fact are statements that could be forward-looking statements. You can identify these forward-looking statements through our use of words such as may, can, anticipate, assume, should, indicate, would, believe, contemplate, expect, seek, estimate, continue, plan, point to, project, predict, could, intend, target, potential and other similar words and expressions of the future. 
 
 Results of Operations and Financial Condition 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 as Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Sales and Cost of Sales 
 
 We did not have any revenue or cost of revenue from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, consisted solely of general and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses consisted primarily of consulting fees, stock-based compensation, board compensation, and legal and professional services. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 our general and administrative expense increased by 219,836, or 133 , from 165,421 to 385,257. The increase in general and administrative expenses was mainly the result of increased amortization expense from the intangible assets acquired by the Company in the fourth quarter of 2023 167,883), increased product development costs 70,700). The increase was offset by decreased legal and professional expenses 23,472).

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 our interest expense decreased by 68,392, or 48 , from 143,279 to 74,887. The decrease primarily resulted from 113,664 less in debt discount amortization from the Company s convertible notes partially offset by 44,495 of additional interest expense accrued during the third quarter of 2024 due to the default interest on the Company s convertible note payables in default.

General and administrative expenses consisted primarily of consulting fees, stock-based compensation, board compensation, and legal and professional services. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 our general and administrative expense increased by 709,754, or 166 , from 427,785 to 1,137,539. The increase in general and administrative expenses was mainly as a result of increased amortization expense from the intangible assets acquired by the Company in the fourth quarter of 2023 500,000), increased product development costs 177,985), increased legal expenses 6,930), increased stock based compensation 6,547) and increased stock transfer fees 5,204). 
 
 Other Expense 
 
 Other expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was composed of interest expense. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 our interest expense decreased by 243,379, or 53 , from 462,601 to 219,222. The decrease was primarily a result from 377,054 less in debt discount amortization from the Company s convertible notes partially offset by 123,868 of additional interest expense due to the default interest on the Company s convertible note payables in default. 
 
 Net Loss 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 we had a net loss of 1,356,761 and 890,386, respectively. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Liquidity is the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs for cash requirements. As of September 30, 2024, we had 202,358 in cash and cash equivalents compared to 279,134 at December 31, 2023, a decrease of 76,776 resulting primarily from cash used in our operations. As of September 30, 2024, we had undiscounted obligations in the amount of approximately 1.3 million relating to the payment of indebtedness due within one year. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had a working capital deficiency of 4,798,602 down from a working capital deficiency of 3,968,589 as of December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024 our current assets were 203,058 and consisted almost entirely of cash. At September 30, 2024 our current liabilities were 5,001,660 and consisted predominantly of related party accrued expenses, convertible notes payable, and shares to be issued. We had an accumulated deficit of 10,317,742 as of September 30, 2024, an increase from an accumulated deficit of 8,960,981 as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 Our monthly operating costs averaged approximately 27,000 per month for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, excluding capital expenditures. We did not have capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We plan to fund our operations with our cash on hand and additional financing.

 Going Concern 
 
 Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue our operations as a going concern is dependent on management s plans. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of 1,356,761, had negative cash flows from operations of 241,776 and may incur additional future losses. At September 30, 2024, the Company had total current assets of 203,058 and total current liabilities of 5,001,660, resulting in a working capital deficit of 4,798,602. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of time within one year after that date that the consolidated financial statements are issued. 
 
 The Company s existence is dependent upon our ability to develop profitable operations. We are devoting substantially all of our efforts to developing the Company s business and raising capital and there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful. No assurance can be given that our actions will result in profitable operations or the resolution of its liquidity problems. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result should the company be unable to continue as a going concern. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 We have no off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 We have identified the policies outlined below as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations. The list is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, with no need for management s judgment in their application. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations when such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see the notes to our September 30, 2024, financial statements. Note that our preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We cannot assure that actual results will not differ from those estimates. 
 
 Intangible assets, net 
 
 The Company s intangible assets include finite lived assets. Finite lived intangible assets, consisting of intellectual property are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. 
 
 Finite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the sum of the expected long-term undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate is less than its carrying amount. Actual future cash flows may differ from the estimates used in the impairment testing. 
 
 Use of estimates 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. These estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis and updated as appropriate. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company s estimates include the useful lives of property plant and equipment. 
 
 The depreciation of equipment is dependent upon estimates of useful lives and residual values, both of which are determined through the exercise of judgement. The assessment of any impairment of these assets is dependent upon estimates of recoverable amounts that consider factors such as economic/market conditions and the useful lives of assets. 
 
 19 
 
 Stock Based Compensation 
 
 We follow ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation, which prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all share-based payment transactions in which employee and non-employee services are acquired. Share-based payments to employees and non-employees, including grants of stock options, are recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements based on their fair values on the grant date. That expense is recognized over the period required to provide services in exchange for the award, known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). 
 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 We are subject to recently issued accounting standards, accounting guidance and disclosure requirements. For a description of these new accounting standards, see Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which is incorporated herein by reference. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 
 Not Applicable.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Accounting Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. As a result of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Accounting Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024.
