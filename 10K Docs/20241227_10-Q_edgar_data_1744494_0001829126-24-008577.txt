CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements, which reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, our operations and financial performance. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, business strategy and plans and our objectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements. The words believe, may, will, estimate, continue, anticipate, intend, expect, should, could, target, predict, seek and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short- and long-term business operations and objectives, and financial needs. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those referenced in the section titled Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 2023 Annual Report which could cause actual results to differ materially. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment and new risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. 

Some of the key factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations include: 

our ability to maintain the listing of our shares of common stock and warrants on Nasdaq; 

our ability to raise financing in the future; 

our success in retaining or recruiting officers, key employees or directors; 

factors relating to our business, operations and financial performance, including: 

our ability to control the costs associated with our operations; 

our ability to grow and manage growth profitably; 

our reliance on complex machinery for our operations and production; 

the market s willingness to adopt our technology; 

our ability to maintain relationships with customers; 

the potential impact of product recalls; 

our ability to compete within our industry; 

increases in costs, disruption of supply or shortage of raw materials; 

risks associated with strategic alliances or acquisitions; 

the impact of unfavorable changes in U.S. and international regulations; 

the availability of and our ability to meet the terms and conditions for government grants and economic incentives; and 

our ability to protect our intellectual property rights; 

market conditions and global and economic factors beyond our control; 

volatility of our stock price and potential share dilution; 

future exchange and interest rates; and 

other factors detailed within the 2023 Annual Report under the section entitled Risk Factors. 

The forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are made only as of the date of this report. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We cannot guarantee that the future results, levels of activity, performance or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur. Moreover, neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to conform these statements to actual results or reflect interim developments. 

As a result of a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties, our actual results or performance may be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of the risks involved in our business and investing in our common stock, see the section entitled Risk Factors within the 2023 Annual Report. 

Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

 NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

of the stock of Legacy Advent (as it existed immediately prior to the Closing) and its subsidiaries. 

On the Closing Date, and in connection with the closing of the Business Combination, AMCI changed its name to Advent Technologies Holdings, Inc. Legacy Advent was deemed the accounting acquirer in the Business Combination based on an analysis of the criteria outlined in Accounting Standards Codification ASC 805. This determination was primarily based on Legacy Advent s stockholders prior to the Business Combination having a majority of the voting interests in the combined company, Legacy Advent s operations comprising the ongoing operations of the combined company, Legacy Advent s board of directors comprising a majority of the board of directors of the combined company, and Legacy Advent s senior management comprising the senior management of the combined company. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Business Combination was treated as the equivalent of Legacy Advent issuing stock for the net assets of AMCI, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of AMCI are stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. 

While AMCI was the legal acquirer in the Business Combination, because Legacy Advent was deemed the accounting acquirer, the historical financial statements of Legacy Advent became the historical financial statements of the combined company, upon the consummation of the Business Combination.

In accordance with guidance applicable to these circumstances, the equity structure has been restated in all comparative periods up to the Closing Date, to reflect the number of shares of the Company s common stock, par value per share, issued to Legacy Advent s stockholders in connection with the recapitalization transaction.

Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP and pursuant to the regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). The unaudited financial information reflects, in the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair statement of the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods indicated. The results reported for the interim period presented are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the full year. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on August 13, 2024. 

We reclassified certain prior year amounts in
our consolidated financial statements to conform to the current year presentation. All reclassifications have been applied consistently to the periods presented. 

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 

Share and per share amounts are presented on a post-conversion basis for all periods presented, unless otherwise specified. 

Going Concern 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company considers that the going concern basis is appropriate for the preparation of its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, as it is pursuing additional fund raising as disclosed below and has no intentions to proceed with liquidation. The going concern basis of presentation assumes that the Company will continue in operation one year from the date these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are issued and will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As such, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets and their carrying amounts, or the amount and classification of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

In accordance with the Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an
Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40), the Company has evaluated whether there are conditions and
events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern
for one year from the date that the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. The Company s ability to
meet its liquidity needs will largely depend on its ability to generate cash in the future. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, the Company provided 3.1 
million of cash in operating activities (excluding discontinued operations), and the Company s ability to generate cash in the future is subject to general
economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond the Company s control.
Furthermore, the Company has suffered recurring operating losses and has a negative net working capital position of 
million as of September 30, 2024. In addition, as of the issuance date of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements the Company is overdue in a number of its obligations which could give the right to creditors at any time from the
issuance date of these consolidated financial statements to raise legal action against the Company which in turn could potentially
lead to liquidation action against the Company and/or its subsidiaries. The transition to profitability and positive cash flow is
highly dependent upon the successful development, approval, and commercialization of the Company s products and the
achievement of a revenue level adequate to support its cost structure and the Company can give no assurances that this will occur.
Based on the Company s current operating plan, the Company believes that its cash and cash equivalents as of September 30,
2024, of 
million and 
million as of December 26, 2024, are not sufficient to fund operations and capital expenditures for the twelve months
following the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and the Company will need to obtain additional funding in the very near
term, otherwise the Company may immediately substantially curtail or terminate its operations. 

The Company performed a cash flow projection on a monthly basis for the twelve-month period following the issuance of the consolidated financial statements. With regards to the cash flow projections, the projected inflows from revenues and grants will be insufficient to cover the projected outflows, as such, the Company will continue to have a negative net working capital position and a delay in the projected timing of the short term financing and inflows and/or an immediate demand by creditors of repayment of the long outstanding payables may result in the Company being insolvent and short of cash at any specific time over the coming weeks and over the next twelve months. 

The highlights of the projections are as follows: 

The Company projects cash inflows from contracted revenues and grants for which it has already signed agreements with third parties and estimates projected outflows assuming the effective implementation of the Company s plans to reduce monthly expenditures gradually during 2024. 

In addition, the projections do not include any cash outflows relating to commitments and contingencies as disclosed in Note 19 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, since the Company believes that any cash outflows relating to these commitments will not materialize based on the Company s plans to agree the termination of such contracts with its suppliers and a contingent loss as outcome of the pending arbitration it is not probable. 

Until such time as the Company generates sufficient revenue to fund its operations (if ever), the Company plans to finance its operations and repay its existing and future liabilities and other obligations through the sale of equity and/or debt securities and, to the extent available, short-term and long-term loans. 

With regards to the projected revenues and grants, a delay in the projected timing of inflows may result in the Company remaining insolvent and short of cash at any specific time over the next twelve months. Also, there is no guarantee that the Company s plans to reduce monthly expenditures will be successful. 

If the Company is unable to obtain sufficient funding, it could be required to delay its development efforts, limit activities, and further reduce research and development costs, which could adversely affect its business prospects and delivery of contractual obligations. A cash shortfall at any point in time over the next twelve months could result in the Company failing to meet its overdue and current obligations which could trigger action against the Company and/or its subsidiaries for liquidation by employees, authorities, or creditors. Because of the uncertainty in securing additional funding, delays in growth of revenue, failure to materialize cost-cutting efforts and the insufficient amount of cash and cash equivalents as of the consolidated financial statement filing date, management has concluded that substantial doubt exists with respect to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. 

million. The restricted cash equivalent was a letter of credit required by the Company s lease agreement for the Hood Park
facility in Boston, MA. The letter of credit is required for the duration of the lease agreement which commenced in
October 2022 and then was terminated in June 2024 resulting in the release of the letter of credit in the benefit of the
landlord. 

The Company reconciles cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents reported in the consolidated balance sheets that aggregate to the beginning and ending balances shown in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows as follows: 

Restricted cash, current

million. As a part of this transaction, Advent SA offered million in bond loans with an annual interest rate of . The term of the loan is three years and there is a surcharge of for overdue interest. 

Cyrus business relates to the research and experimental development in natural sciences and mechanics, the construction of pumps and hydrogen compressors and the wholesale of compressors. Hydrogen compressors are a critical part of the Hydrogen Refueling Stations (HRS) to be used by transport applications. Cyrus has developed a prototype Metal Hydride Compressor which offers unique advantages. The proceeds from the Bond Loan are to cover Cyrus s working capital needs in the context of its operation and the product development. 

Mandatory conversion of the Bond Loan will occur in the event of qualified financing which is equivalent to a share capital increase by Cyrus in the first three years from the execution of the Bond Loan agreement with a total amount over 3 million which is covered by third parties unrelated to the basic shareholders or by investors related to them. 

The Company classifies the Bond Loan as an available for sale financial asset on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company recognizes interest income within the consolidated statement of operations. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized thousand and thousand of interest income related to the Bond Loan within the consolidated statements of operations, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized thousand and thousand of interest income related to the Bond Loan within the consolidated statements of operations, respectively. 

The Company initially measured the available for sale Bond Loan at the transaction price plus any applicable transaction costs. The Bond Loan is remeasured to its fair value at each reporting period and upon settlement. The estimated fair value of the Bond Loan is determined using Level 3 inputs by using a discounted cash flow model. The change in fair value is recognized within the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. As of September 30, 2024, the Company continues to fully reserve the Bond Loan as an expected credit loss. The Company did not recognize any unrealized gain / (loss) during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, or 2023.

Any remaining deferred costs will be expensed to the statements of operations should the planned offering be terminated. 

Public Warrants 

In connection with the Business Combination, the Company assumed the Public Warrants issued upon AMCI s initial public offering. 

As of December 31, 2020, the Company had Public Warrants outstanding. Each Public Warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one share of common stock at a price of per share, subject to adjustment, at any time commencing 30 days after the completion of the Business Combination. The Public Warrants will expire five years after the completion of the Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. During the second quarter of 2021, certain warrant holders exercised their option to purchase an additional shares at per share. These exercises generated additional proceeds to the Company and increased the Company s shares outstanding by shares. During 2023, one original Private Warrant Holder sold all their Private Placement Warrants resulting in a reclassification to Public Warrants. Following these exercises, as of September 30, 2024, the Company s Public Warrants amounted to . 

Once the warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the Public Warrants: 

in whole and not in part; 

at a price of per warrant; 

upon not less than days prior written notice of redemption; 

if, and only if, the reported last sale price of the Company s Common Stock equals or exceeds per share for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending three business days before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders; and 

if, and only if, there is a current registration statement in effect with respect to the shares of Common Stock underlying such warrants. 

If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a cashless basis, as described in the warrant agreement. The exercise price and number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the warrants will not be adjusted for issuance of Common Stock at a price below its exercise price. In addition, the warrant agreement provides that in case of a tender offer or exchange that involves 50 or more of the Company s stockholders, the Public Warrants may be settled in cash, equity securities or other assets depending on the kind and amount received per share by the holders of the common stock in such consolidation or merger that affirmatively make such election. 

The Public Warrants are classified in equity in accordance with the Company s evaluation of the provisions of ASC 480 and ASC 815. The Company analyzed the terms of the Public Warrants and concluded that there are no terms that provide that the warrant is not indexed to the issuer s common stock. The Company also analyzed the tender offer provision discussed above and considering that upon the Closing of the Business Combination the Company has a single class of common shares, concluded that the exception discussed in ASC 815-40-25 applies, and thus equity classification is not precluded.

Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss for the periods presented by the weighted-average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during these periods. 

Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss, by the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding for the periods, adjusted for the dilutive effect of shares of Common Stock equivalents resulting from the assumed exercise of the Public Warrants, Private Placements Warrants, Working Capital Warrants, Stock Options and RSUs. The treasury stock method was used to calculate the potential dilutive effect of these Common Stock equivalents. 

As the Company incurred losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the effect of including any potential shares of Common Stock in the denominator of diluted per-share computations would have been anti-dilutive; therefore, basic and diluted losses per share are the same.

Overview 

Advent Technologies Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as Advent and the Company is an advanced materials and technology development company operating in the fuel cell, methanol, and hydrogen technology space. Advent is a world-leading company in the development of the HT-PEM technology (with more than 150 patents issued, pending, or licensed worldwide). The HT-PEM fuel cell technology developed by Advent enables off-grid power systems to produce clean power from various green fuels (hydrogen, methanol, bio and eMethanol, and renewable natural gas) and to function with higher efficiency at extreme ambient temperatures and in general extreme environmental conditions (humidity, air pollution). Advent s main operations focus on developing and manufacturing the Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA), which is the core electrochemical element and the most critical component of the fuel cell. The MEA largely determines lifetime, power density, efficiency, and overall cost of installation and operation for all applications. Advent is working with world-leading market-leading OEMs with the goal of bringing to the market complete fuel cell systems for a range of applications in the stationary power markets (backup, off-grid, and portable power) and the heavy-duty mobility markets (automotive, aviation, marine). 

Advent s core product offerings are fuel cell stacks and the Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA) at the center of the fuel cell. The Advent MEA, which derives its key benefits from the properties of Advent s engineered membrane and electrode technology, enables a high power-density, longer-lasting and ultimately lower-cost fuel cell product. 

Advent s principal operations have been to develop and manufacture MEAs, and to design fuel cell stacks and complete fuel cell systems for a range of applications in the stationary power, portable power, automotive, aviation, energy storage and sensor markets. Advent has its headquarters in Livermore, California, and product development facilities in Livermore, California and Patras, Greece. 

The majority of Advent s current revenue derives from Joint Development Agreements (JDAs) and Technology Assessment Agreements (TAAs) with world-leading OEMs for the development of joint products. The ultimate goal is that OEMs will bring to the market with Advent-inside technology (the Advent MEA and/or the Advent Fuel Cell Stack). The Company has also extensive know-how and IP in the development of full fuel cell systems that it intends to license out to OEMs and Tier1s through technology license agreements. Advent has also secured grant funding for a range of projects from research agencies and other organizations. Advent expects to continue to be eligible for grant funding based on its product development activities over the foreseeable future.

Selection of Wearable Fuel Cell for the DOD 2021 Validation Program 

On March 31, 2021, we announced that Advent s 50 W Reformed Methanol Wearable Fuel Cell Power System Honey Badger had been selected by the DoD National Defense Center for Energy and Environment NDCEE to take part in its demonstration/validation program for 2021. The NDCEE is a DOD program that addresses high-priority environmental, safety, occupational health, and energy technological challenges that are demonstrated and validated at active installations for military application. The Company believes Advent s Honey Badger 50 HB50 fuel cell is the only fuel cell that is part of this program that supports the U.S. Army s goal of having a technology-enabled force by 2028. 

Launch of the Honey Badger 50 Fuel Cell System 

On August 4, 2022, we announced the launch of our HB50 power system, a compact portable fuel cell system and quiet power supply for use in off-grid field applications such as military and rescue operations. The launch of Advent s portable power system coincided with the Company s fulfilment of its first shipment order from the U.S. Department of Defense. The HB50 power system can be fueled by biodegradable methanol, allowing near silent generation of up to 50W of continuous power with clean emissions. Designed for covert operations, HB50 can easily power radio and satellite communications gear, remote fixed and mobile surveillance systems, and laptop computers along with more general battery charging needs. HB50 is a unique technology that can provide 65 of weight savings versus batteries over a typical 72-hour mission. The weight savings benefit increases further for longer missions. 

HB50 s unique design allows it to be used in soldier-worn configurations or operated inside a portable backpack or vehicle while charging batteries and powering soldier systems, while its thermal features allow it to operate within an ambient temperature range of -20 C to +55 C. Aside from its optimized compatibility with Integrated Visual Augmentation System IVAS ), HB50 can also power devices such as high frequency radios like the model 117G, as well as B-GAN and StarLink terminals. HB50 s durability allows it to be easily deployed in challenging conditions and climates while supporting mission mobility for three to seven days without the need to re-supply. 

Since Honey Badger s fuel cell technology can run on hydrogen or liquid fuels, the system can operate at a fraction of the weight of traditional military-grade batteries to meet the U.S. Department of Defense s continuously evolving needs for on-the-go electronics needs. As military adoption and use of IVAS equipment continues to evolve, the highly portable lightweight power solutions like Honey Badger and HB50 will become a mission critical necessity. 

In September 2023, Advent secured a new 2.2 million contract with the U.S. DOD. This milestone achievement comes under the General Technical Services prime contract and will play a crucial role in supporting the demanding defense mission requirements of the U.S. Army. This contract is the continuation of a series of past contracts with the U.S. DOD and its primary objective is to further optimize Advent s proprietary Honey Badger 50 portable fuel cell system by integrating the Company s innovative Ion Pair MEA technology. Upon the completion of this new 12-month contract, Advent and the U.S. DOD aim to reinforce their long-term collaboration by focusing on the manufacturing process of the enhanced HB50 fuel cell system, that will enable high-volume production manufacturing capacity. MEAs form the heart of the fuel cell, and their performance determines the lifetime, efficiency, weight, and to a large extent, the cost of the end electrochemistry products. Advent s Ion Pair MEA technology is anticipated to significantly enhance HB50 s performance, resulting in higher power density and improved compact packaging, making it an ideal solution for off-grid field applications, including military and rescue operations. 

39 

In
December 2023, Advent secured a new 2.8 million contract with the U.S. DOD. Under this new defense contract which comes under the
umbrella of the Envision Innovative Solutions EIS ), Advent will develop advanced manufacturing processes
to enable a substantial increase in the production capacity while maintaining quality of the HB50 system. This new project is aligned
with Advent s and the DOD s shared objective to strengthen their long-term collaboration and transform HB50 into a portable
and clean source of power. 

Advent Technologies A/S declared bankrupt 

On July 25, 2024, Advent Technologies A/S was declared bankrupt by the court in Aalborg, Denmark. The petition was brought by IDA, the union of engineers with a claim for 402,000. As the Company did not have the ability to pay the full amount due, the Danish court declared Advent Technologies A/S bankrupt. Advent Technologies A/S and its wholly-owned subsidiary Green Energy Philippines, Inc. will be liquidated by the court appointed trustee to settle all claims under the bankruptcy. The Company anticipates it will receive no residual assets. The remainder of the Company s legal entities have no plans to declare bankruptcy and will continue as going concern entities. 

Key Factors Affecting Our Results 

Advent believes that its performance and future success depend on several factors that present significant opportunities for Advent but also pose risks and challenges, including those discussed below. 

Increased Customer Demand 

Based on conversations with existing customers and incoming inquiries from new customers, Advent anticipates substantial increased demand for its fuel cell systems and MEAs from a wide range of customers as it scales up its production facilities and testing capabilities, and as the awareness of its MEA capabilities becomes widely known in the industry. In order for Advent to be able to capitalize this opportunity the Company will need to accomplish the MEA performance targets and also partner with OEMs that can bring end products to the market based on Advent s technology. Advent is focusing its efforts on enabling these OEMs and working with them closely. 

Successful development of the Advanced MEA product 

Advent s future success depends in large part on the increasing integration of the hydrogen and efuel (eMethanol, renewable natural gas) fuel cell into the energy transition globally over the next decade. In order to become cost-competitive with existing renewable power generation and energy storage technology and achieve widespread adoption, fuel cells will need to achieve substantial improvement in the cost/kW performance ratio delivered to prospective fuel cell customers, predominantly OEMs, System Integrators and major energy companies. Advent expects to play an important enabling role in the adoption of hydrogen and methanol fuel cells, as its MEA technology is the critical determining factor in the cost/kW performance ratio of the fuel cells. In partnership with the Los Alamos National Laboratory, Advent is currently developing its next generation MEA technology Advent MEA which is anticipated to deliver as much as three times the power output of its current MEA product. While Advent is already projecting being able to pass through cost benefits to its customers through economies of scale as it increases MEA production, the successful development of the Advent MEA will be an important factor in delivering the required improvement in cost/kw performance to Advent s customers.

Cost of Revenues 

Cost of revenues decreased by approximately 0.4 million from approximately 1.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to approximately 0.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in cost of revenues was related to the focus on providing services under Joint Development Agreements (JDAs) and Technology Assessment Agreements (TAAs) and a shift from product sales during the period. 

44 

Income from Grants 

Our income from grants increased by approximately 0.6 million from approximately 0.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to approximately 1.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was driven by our services provided in Greece in the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Research and Development Expenses 

Research and development expenses were approximately 2.5 million and 4.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily related to internal research and development costs, as well as our cooperative research and development agreement with the U.S. Department of Energy. 

Administrative and Selling Expenses 

Administrative and selling expenses were approximately 7.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 10.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The expenses are primarily derived from payroll, stock based compensation, rent, legal fees and contractor costs. 

Sublease income 

The Company earned sublease income of 0.1 million and 0.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The sublease was terminated in April 2024. 

Impairment Losses 

We recognized impairment losses of 9.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily related to goodwill and other intangible assets from the UltraCell and SerEnergy and FES acquisitions. 

Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liability 

The change in fair value of warrant liability amounting to 0.1 million and 0.4 million was due to the change in fair value of the Private Placement Warrants and Working Capital Warrants for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Finance income / (expenses), net 

Finance income / (expenses) of 0.3 million and 0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Foreign exchange gains / (losses), net 

The Company recognized (1.8) million of losses due to foreign exchange for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company recognized 0.1 million of gains due to foreign exchange for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Other Income / (Expenses), Net 

Other income / (expenses) of 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Other income / (expenses) of (0.9) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily relate to the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement. 

Loss contingency 

The Company accrued a loss contingency of 4.9 million related to the Fischer litigation for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Net gains / (losses) on disposal/write-offs of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets 

The Company recorded net losses of 12.7 million related to the exit of Hood Park and the sale of the coating machines for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

At September 30, 2024 and for the nine months then ended, the Company had 0.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, provided 3.1 million of cash in operating activities, had 2.1 million in current assets and 25.1 million in current liabilities, leaving the Company a working capital deficit of (23.0) million. 

45 

A major financial challenge and significant risk facing the Company is a lack of positive cash flow and liquidity. The Company s ability to meet its liquidity needs will largely depend on its ability to raise capital in the very short term and generate cash in the future. If the Company is unable to obtain sufficient funding, it could be required to delay its development efforts, limit activities, and further reduce research and development costs, which could adversely affect its business prospects and delivery of contractual obligations. A cash shortfall at any point in time over the next twelve months could result in the Company failing to meet its overdue and current obligations which could trigger action against the Company and/or its subsidiaries for liquidation by employees, authorities, or creditors. Because of the uncertainty in securing additional funding, delays in growth of revenue, failure to materialize cost-cutting efforts and the insufficient amount of cash and cash equivalents as of the consolidated financial statement filing date, management has concluded that substantial doubt exists with respect to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date the consolidated financial statements are issued. 

The following table sets forth a summary of our consolidated cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the changes between periods.

Cash flows used in Operating Activities 

Advent s cash flows from operating activities reflect the income statement position adjusted for working capital movements in current assets and liabilities. As Advent grows, it expects that operating cash flows will be affected by increased working capital needs to support growth in personnel-related expenditures and fluctuations in accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and other current assets and liabilities. 

Net cash provided by / (used in) operating activities was approximately 3.1 million and (36.2) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which related to outflows in connection with administrative and selling expenses, research and development expenses, and costs associated with insurances services and other personnel costs. 

46 

Cash Flows provided by / (used in) Investing Activities 

Advent s cash flows provided by / (used in) investing activities was approximately 0.3 million and (6.1) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and which mostly related to the sale and acquisition of plant and equipment, respectively. 

Cash Flows provided by Financing Activities 

Advent s cash flows provided by financing activities was approximately 0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which represents the net proceeds of issuance of common stock and paid-in capital in connection with the At the Market Offering with H.C. Wainwright Co., LLC. 

Advent s cash flows from financing activities was approximately 5.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which related to the net cash proceeds from the sale of shares under the Lincoln Park facility. 

Reverse Stock Split 

On April 29, 2024 and April 30, 2024, our stockholders and Board, respectively, approved a reverse stock split of our Common Stock, at a ratio of 1-for-30 (the Reverse Stock Split ), as of the Effective Date. The Effective Date of the Reverse Stock Split with the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts was 5:00 p.m. on May 13, 2024 and May 14, 2024 in the marketplace. 

On the Effective Date, the total number of shares of our Common Stock held by each shareholder was converted automatically into the number of whole shares of Common Stock equal to (i) the number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock held by such shareholder immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split, divided by (ii) 30. 

No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split, and stockholders who would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share received a proportional cash payment in April 2024. 

The Company is authorized to issue 501,000,000 shares of Common Stock and that number did not change as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. 

The Reverse Stock Split did not have any effect on the stated par value of our Common Stock. The rights and privileges of the holders of shares of Common Stock are unaffected by the Reverse Stock Split. All of our options, warrants and convertible securities outstanding immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split have been appropriately adjusted by dividing the number of shares of Common Stock into which the options, warrants and convertible securities are exercisable or convertible by 30. 

Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities 

Contract assets reflect revenue recognized and performance obligations satisfied in advance of customer billing. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Advent recognized contract assets of nil and 9 thousand, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. 

Advent recognizes contract liabilities when we receive customer payments or have the unconditional right to receive consideration in advance of the performance obligations being satisfied on our contracts. We receive payments from customers based on the terms established in our contracts. Contract liabilities are classified as either current or long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets based on the timing of when we expect to recognize the related revenue. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Advent recognized contract liabilities of 1.2 million and 0.4 million, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets. 

Off-Balance Sheet Commitments and Arrangements 

Since the date of our incorporation, Advent has not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC. 

47 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Advent s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires Advent to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the balance sheet date, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting period. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences could be material to Advent s financial statements. 

Revenue Recognition from January 1, 2019 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), as amended, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. We adopted ASU No. 2014-09 on January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective approach to all contracts not completed at the date of initial application. 

In accordance with ASC 606, revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration that Advent expects to receive in exchange for those services. We apply the following five steps in order to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfills its obligations under each of its arrangements: 

identify the contract with a customer, 

identify the performance obligations in the contract, 

determine the transaction price, 

allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract, and 

recognize revenue as the performance obligation is satisfied. 

With significant and recurring customers, we negotiate written master agreements as framework agreements (general terms and conditions of trading), following individual purchase orders. For customers with no master agreements, the approved purchase orders form the contract. Effectively, contracts under the revenue standard have been assessed to be the purchase orders agreed with customers. 

We have assessed that each product sold is a single performance obligation because the promised goods are distinct on their own and within the context of the contract. In cases where the agreement includes customization services for the contracted products, we are providing integrated services; therefore, the goods are not separately identifiable, but are inputs to produce and deliver a combined output and form a single performance obligation within the context of the contract. Furthermore, we assessed whether it acts as a principal or agent in each of its revenue arrangements and has concluded that in all sales transactions it acts as a principal. Additionally, we, taking into consideration the guidance and indicative factors provided by ASC 606, concluded that it provides assurance type warranties (warranty period is up to two years) as it does not provide a service to the customer beyond fixing defects that existed at the time of sale. We, based on historical performance, current circumstances, and projections of trends, estimated that no allowance for returns as per warranty policy should be recognized, at the time of sale, accounted for under ASC 460, Guarantees. 

Under ASC 606, we estimate the transaction price, including variable consideration, at the commencement of the contract and recognize revenue over the contract term, rather than when fees become fixed or determinable. In other words, where contracts with customers include variable consideration (i.e. volume rebates), we estimate at contract inception the variable consideration and adjust the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Furthermore, no material rights or significant financing components have been identified in our contracts. Payment terms generally include advance payment requirements. The time between a customer s payment and completion of the performance obligation is less than one year. Payment terms are in the majority fixed and do not include variable consideration, except from volume rebates. 

48 

Revenue from satisfaction of performance obligations is recognized based on identified transaction price. The transaction price reflects the amount to which we have rights under the present contract. It is allocated to the distinct performance obligations based on standalone selling prices of the services promised in the contract. In cases of more than one performance obligation, we allocate transaction price to the distinct performance obligations in proportion to their observable stand-alone selling prices and recognize revenue as those performance obligations are satisfied. 

In the majority of cases of product sales, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer obtains control of the respective goods that is, when the products are shipped from our facilities as control passes to the customer in accordance with agreed contracts and the stated shipping terms. In cases where the contract includes customization services, in which one performance obligation is identified, revenue is recognized over time as our performance does not create an asset with alternative use and we have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. We use the input method (i.e., cost-to-cost method) to measure progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation. 

Income from grants and related deferred income 

Grants include cash subsidies received from various institutions and organizations. Grants are recognized as other income. Such amounts are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations when all conditions attached to the grants are fulfilled. 

Condition to the grants would not be fulfilled unless related costs have been characterized as eligible by the grantors, are actually incurred and there is certainty that costs are allowable. These grants are recognized as deferred income when received and recorded in income when the eligible and allowable related costs and expenses are incurred. Under all grant programs, a coordinator is specified. The coordinator, among other, receives the funding from the grantor and proceeds to its distribution to the parties agreed in the process specified in the program. We assessed whether it acts as a principal or agent in its role as a coordinator for specific grants and has concluded that in all related transactions it acts as an agent. 

Income Taxes 

Advent follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under ASC 740, Income Taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. This method also requires the recognition of future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carry forwards, to the extent that it is more likely than not that such benefits will be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that included the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Valuation allowances are reassessed periodically to determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized in the future and if any existing valuation allowance should be released. 

Part of the Advent s business activities are conducted through its subsidiaries outside of U.S. Earnings from these subsidiaries are generally indefinitely reinvested in the local businesses. Further, local laws and regulations may also restrict certain subsidiaries from paying dividends to their parents. Consequently, Advent generally does not accrue income taxes for the repatriation of such earnings in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. To the extent that there are excess accumulated earnings that we intend to repatriate from any such subsidiaries, we recognize deferred tax liabilities on such foreign earnings. 

Advent assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based on the evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at each reporting date. For those tax positions with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information, Advent records a tax benefit. For those income tax positions that are not likely to be sustained, no tax benefit is recognized in the consolidated financial statements. Advent recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes. 

49 

ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. For those income tax positions that are not likely to be sustained, no tax benefit is recognized in the consolidated financial statements. Advent recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net income tax (expenses) benefits of nil and 81 thousand, respectively, have been recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net income tax (expenses) benefits of 55 thousand and 0.2 million, respectively, have been recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. Advent is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant accruals or material deviation from its position. Advent is subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities. 

Advent and its U.S. subsidiaries may be subject to potential examination by U.S. federal, state and city, while Advent s subsidiaries outside U.S. may be subject to potential examination by their taxing authorities in the areas of income taxes. These potential examinations may include questioning the timing and amount of deductions, the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with the U.S. federal, state and city, and tax laws in the countries where business activities of Advent s subsidiaries are conducted. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was signed into legislation. As part of the legislation, the U.S. corporate income tax rate was reduced from 35 to 21 , among other changes. 

Warrant Liability 

Advent accounts for the 878,985 warrants (comprising of 813,314 Public Warrants and 65,671 Private Placement Warrants) issued in connection with the initial public offering and the 13,333 Working Capital Warrants issued at the consummation of the Business Combination in accordance with ASC 815-40-15-7D. If the warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment, they must be recorded as liabilities. We have determined that only the Private Placement Warrants and Working Capital Warrants must be recorded as liabilities and accordingly, we classify these warrant instruments as liabilities at their fair value and adjusts the instruments to fair value at each reporting period. These liabilities are subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until exercised, and any change in fair value is recognized in our statement of operations. The fair value of the Private Placement Warrants and the Working Capital Warrants has been determined using either the quoted price, if available, or was based on a modified Black-Scholes-Merton model. The fair value of the Private Placement Warrants and the Working Capital Warrants has been determined based on a modified Black-Scholes-Merton model for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by Advent as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, Advent believes that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on Advent s financial position or results of operations under adoption. 

See Note 2 in the condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information about recent accounting pronouncements, the timing of their adoption and Advent s assessment, to the extent Advent has made one, of their potential impact on Advent s financial condition and results of operations. 

Supplemental Non-GAAP Measures and Reconciliations 

In addition to providing measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, we present certain supplemental non-GAAP measures. These measures are EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income / (Loss), which we use to evaluate our operating performance, for business planning purposes and to measure our performance relative to that of our peers. These non-GAAP measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore may differ from similar measures presented by other companies and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures. We believe these measures are useful in evaluating the operating performance of Advent s ongoing business. These measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for net income, operating expense and income, cash flows and other measures of financial performance and liquidity reported in accordance with GAAP. The calculation of these non-GAAP measures has been made on a consistent basis for all periods presented. 

50 

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 

These supplemental non-GAAP measures are provided to assist readers in determining our operating performance. We believe this measure is useful in assessing performance and highlighting trends on an overall basis. We also believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are frequently used by securities analysts and investors when comparing our results with those of other companies. EBITDA differs from the most comparable GAAP measure, net income / (loss), primarily because it does not include interest, income taxes, depreciation of property, plant and equipment, and amortization of intangible assets. Adjusted EBITDA adjusts EBITDA for items such as one-time transaction costs, asset impairment charges, and fair value changes in the warrant liability. 

The following tables show a reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

Advent is exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in interest rates and inflation, as well as risks to the availability of funding sources, hazard events and specific asset risks. 

Interest Rate Risk 

Advent holds cash and cash equivalents for working capital, investment and general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2024, Advent had an unrestricted cash balance of approximately 0.2 million, consisting of operating and savings accounts which are not affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates. Advent is not expected to be materially exposed to interest rate risk in the future as it intends to take on limited debt finance. 

Inflation Risk 

Advent does not believe that inflation currently has a material effect on its business. To mitigate cost increases caused by inflation, Advent has taken steps such as searching for alternative supplies at a lower cost and pre-buying materials and supplies at a more advantageous price in advance of its intended use. 

Foreign Exchange Risk 

Advent has costs and revenues denominated in Euros, Danish krone and Philippine pesos, and therefore is exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates. To date, Advent has not entered into any hedging transactions to mitigate the effect of foreign exchange due to the relatively low exposure. As we increase in scale, we expect to continue to realize a portion of our revenues and costs in foreign currencies, and therefore expect to put in place appropriate foreign exchange risk mitigation features in due course. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management, with the participation of our Interim Chief Executive Officer (currently also serving as Interim Chief Financial Officer) has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Report on Form 10-Q. 

The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 

As described below, based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report on Form 10-Q, management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. As a result of the material weaknesses, our Interim Chief Executive Officer (currently also serving as Interim Chief Financial Officer) has concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file and submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported as and when required. 

52 

Notwithstanding these material weaknesses identified, our management, including our Interim Chief Executive Officer (currently also serving as Interim Chief Financial Officer), has concluded that our financial statements included in this Report on Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 

Management s Quarterly Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures that: 

(i) 
 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; 

(ii) 
 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and 

(iii) 
 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). 

Based on this assessment and the evaluation of those criteria, management, including our Interim Chief Executive Officer (currently also serving as Interim Chief Financial Officer), concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September 30, 2024, due to the material weaknesses described below. 

A material weakness (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

Entity-Level Control Environment 

The entity-level control environment did not adequately support the prevention, detection or correction of material misstatements. We identified deficiencies in all five components of the entity-level control environment, including the control environment, control activities, information and communication, monitoring and risk assessment that aggregated into material weaknesses. Overall, we did not sufficiently establish internal control policies and procedures in our material business processes related to the financial reporting process. 

Financial Statement Close and Reporting Process 

We did not adequately design and execute controls that addressed the relevant financial statement assertions over the close and reporting process including review controls, journal entries and adjustments during the period-end reporting, changes to general ledger master data. We lacked in certain instances sufficient and appropriate documentation, reconciliation controls and segregation of duties controls. 

53 

IT Processes 

Internal controls that address the IT risks of applications were not adequately designed and implemented. Management did not adequately perform controls or retain sufficient and appropriate evidence over 1) user access controls 2) application change controls and 3) the timeliness of segregation of duties access monitoring procedures. 

To mitigate the potential impact of material weaknesses, and prior to filing this report, we performed additional analysis and other post-closing procedures to determine that our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These material weaknesses did not result in any material misstatements and there were no changes to previously released financial statements. Notwithstanding our material weaknesses, we have concluded that the financial statements and other financial information included in this Report on Form 10-Q fairly present in all material respects our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with U.S. GAAP. 

Remediation Plan 

Following the identification of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, and with the oversight of the Audit Committee of our Board, we will commence remediation efforts to enhance our control environment. 

Hiring and augmenting our team with knowledgeable and qualified IT, accounting, and finance professionals. 

Enhancing the robustness and effectiveness of our IT systems and control environment. 

Enhancing related policies and process documentation, implementing new controls or redesigning existing ones, and improving the skills of process owners. 

Training process owners, evaluating the adoption of revised policies and procedures, and monitoring results. 

Increasing the frequency and independence of testing the design and operating effectiveness of controls. 

Management is committed to successfully implementing the remediation plan as promptly as possible. Our plan can only be accomplished over time, and we can offer no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects. See Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Operations and Business We have identified material weaknesses in our system of internal controls pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. If not remediated, these material weaknesses could result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements. We may be unable to develop, implement and maintain appropriate controls in future periods. within the 2023 Annual Report. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Financial Statement Close and Reporting Process 

We did not adequately maintain accounting records at the consolidated level, resulting in a loss of access to underlying systems and records with the bankruptcy of Advent Technologies A/S in July 2024. The Company generated estimates using internal management reporting and bank statements as part of the September 30, 2024, close and reporting process. 

Except as otherwise noted above and also under Remediation Plan, including the on-going remediation efforts described, there were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a 15(f) and 15d-15(f)) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Our plans for remediating the material weaknesses, described above, will constitute changes in our internal control over financial reporting, prospectively, when such remediation plans are effectively implemented

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 

We are from time to time subject to various claims, lawsuits and other legal and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Some of these claims, lawsuits and other proceedings may involve highly complex issues that are subject to substantial uncertainties, and could result in damages, fines, penalties, non-monetary sanctions or relief. However, we do not consider any such claims, lawsuits or proceedings that are currently pending, individually or in the aggregate, to be material to our business with one exception: 

On June 7, 2023, the Company was served a Request for Arbitration from F.E.R. fischer Edelstahlrohre GmbH F.E.R. ), pursuant to the arbitration provisions of the Share Purchase Agreement dated June 25, 2021 whereby the Company acquired SerEnergy and FES, which acquisition closed on August 31, 2021. The arbitration was held in Frankfurt am Main, Germany in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the German Arbitration Institute, and the parties presented closing arguments in May 2024. F.E.R. is asserting that it is due approximately 4.5 million based on the cap and corresponding value of the share consideration at the date of closing. On August 16, 2024, the Company was informed that an arbitration decision and award was decided in favor of F.E.R. in the amount of approximately 4.5 million. On November 18, 2024, the Company filed a motion with the Higher Regional Court of Frankfurt to set aside the arbitral award. At this time, the Company cannot accurately predict the outcome of this matter, however, has recorded a loss contingency in the amount of 4.9 million, accrued interest expense of 0.3 million for a total of 5.2 million accrued loss liability as of September 30, 2024. 

By letter dated September 14, 2023, a purported shareholder of the Company made a demand to inspect the Company s books and records pursuant 8 Del. C. 220 Demand ). The Demand purported to request access to books and records of the Company and its predecessor, AMCI Acquisition Corp. AMCI ), to investigate possible alleged breaches of fiduciary duties by AMCI s board of directors and officers in connection with its merger with the Company on February 4, 2021. As of May 24, 2024, the purported shareholder entered into a tolling agreement with the Company and the former directors of AMCI that tolled all claims for the period January 29, 2024 through June 30, 2024. On June 5, 2024, the purported shareholder filed a putative class action complaint Complaint on behalf of in the Delaware Court of Chancery alleging claims of breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment in connection with the SPAC transaction against former officers and directors of AMCI.
