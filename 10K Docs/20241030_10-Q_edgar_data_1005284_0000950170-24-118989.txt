The total number of shares that may be subject to awards under the Equity Compensation Plan is equal to the shares that were available for issuance and not subject to an award under the 2014 Equity Compensation Plan at the time it was replaced by the Equity Compensation Plan, subject to adjustment with respect to shares underlying any outstanding award granted under the Equity Compensation Plan or the 2014 Equity Compensation Plan that may expire, or be terminated, surrendered or forfeited for any reason, without issuance of such shares. As of September 30, 2024 , there were shares that remained available to be granted under the Equity Compensation Plan. The Equity Compensation Plan will terminate on June 15, 2033. Restricted Stock Awards and Units The Company has issued restricted stock awards and units to employees and non-employees with vesting terms of one to five years. The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant for awards granted to employees. Consistent with the accounting for equity-classified awards issued to employees, our equity-classified nonemployee share-based awards are measured at the grant date fair value. Expense for restricted stock awards and units is amortized ratably over the vesting period for the awards issued to employees and using a graded vesting method for the awards issued to non-employees. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company granted shares of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units to employees and non-employees, which had a total fair value of million on the respective dates of grant, and will vest over three to from the date of grant, provided that the grantee is still an employee of the Company or is still providing services to the Company on the applicable vesting date.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan On April 7, 2009, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). The ESPP was approved by the Company s shareholders and became effective on June 25, 2009. The Company has reserved shares of common stock for issuance under the ESPP. Unless terminated by the Board of Directors, the ESPP will expire when all reserved shares have been issued. Eligible employees may elect to contribute to the ESPP through payroll deductions during consecutive purchase periods, the first of which began on July 1, 2009. Each employee who elects to participate will be deemed to have been granted an option to purchase shares of the Company s common stock on the first day of the purchase period. Unless the employee opts out during the purchase period, the option will automatically be exercised on the last day of the period, which is the purchase date, based on the employee s accumulated contributions to the ESPP. The purchase price will equal of the lesser of the closing price per share of common stock on the first business day of the period or the last business day of the period. Employees may allocate up to of their base compensation to purchase shares of common stock under the ESPP; however, each employee may purchase no more than shares on a given purchase date, and no employee may purchase more than of common stock under the ESPP during a given calendar year. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the Company issued and shares, respectively, of its common stock under the ESPP, resulting in proceeds of million and million, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the Company recorded charges of and , respectively, to selling, general and administrative expense, and , respectively, to research and development expense, and and , respectively, to cost of sales related to the ESPP equal to the amount of the discount and the value of the look-back feature.

million on available-for-sale securities. The valuation allowance of million that resulted from an unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities during prior periods was reversed through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. There are no indicators against the realizability of the remaining net deferred tax asset. On December 27, 2018, the Korean Supreme Court, citing prior cases, held that only royalties paid with respect to Korean registered patents are considered Korean source income and subject to Korean withholding tax under the applicable law and interpretation of the Korea-U.S. Tax Treaty. The Company has incurred Korean withholding tax of million for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, through December 31, 2022. Based on the Korean Supreme Court decision, a tax refund request on behalf of the Company was filed with the Korean National Tax Service (KNTS) for the entire period from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2022. The Company received a formal rejection from the KNTS; and in May 2022 filed an appeal with the Korean Tax Tribunal. On December 18, 2023, the Company received a formal rejection from the Tax Tribunal. Anticipating the rejection of the appeal, in September 2023 the Company filed a petition to the District Court and is awaiting its decision. The Company has been advised by a prominent Korean law firm that there is a more-likely-than-not chance of success. As a result, the Company has recorded a long-term asset of million and million as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023 , respectively for the receipt of the Korean withholding tax. The Company also recorded foreign exchange gain of million and foreign exchange loss of million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and foreign exchange loss of and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, due to the fluctuation of the Korean Won to the U.S. Dollar and resulting remeasurement of this Won-denominated receivable. The Company will amend U.S. federal tax returns for the 2018 to 2022 years when the anticipated refund from KNTS is received to offset the additional tax liability. The Company has recorded a long-term liability of million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, for the estimated amounts due to the U.S. federal government based on the amendment of the Company's U.S. tax returns, indicating that lower withholding amounts were required. The Company is not subject to examinations by the federal tax authority for the years prior to 2020. The Company's state and foreign tax returns are open for a period of generally three to . The Company is under California tax audit for 2019 and 2020 years, which is in the information-collecting stage. The above estimates may change in the future and upon settlement.

 OVERVIEW 
 We are a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode (OLED) technologies and materials for use in display applications, such as mobile phones, televisions, monitors, wearables, tablets, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers and automotive applications, as well as specialty and general lighting products. Since 1994, we have been engaged and expect to continue to be primarily engaged, in funding and performing research and development activities relating to OLED technologies and materials, and commercializing these technologies and materials. We derive our revenue primarily from the following: 
 sales of OLED materials for evaluation, development and commercial manufacturing; 

intellectual property and technology licensing; 

technology development and support, including third-party collaboration efforts and providing support to third parties for commercialization of their OLED products; and 

contract research services in the areas of chemical materials synthesis research, development and commercialization for non-OLED applications. 

Material sales relate to our sale of OLED materials for incorporation into our customers commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Material sales are generally recognized at the time title passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties. 
 We receive license and royalty payments under certain commercial, development and technology evaluation agreements, some of which are non-refundable advances. These payments may include royalty and license fees made pursuant to license agreements and also license fees included as part of certain commercial supply agreements. These payments are included in the estimate of total contract consideration by customer and recognized as revenue over the contract term based on material units sold at the estimated per unit fee over the life of the contract. 
 On December 2, 2022, we entered into a commercial patent license agreement with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC), replacing a previous license agreement that had been in place since 2018. This agreement, which covers the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, was effective as of January 1, 2023 and lasts through the end of 2027 with an additional two-year extension option for SDC. Under this agreement, we are being paid a license fee, which includes quarterly and annual payments over the agreement 
 27 

term of five years. The agreement conveys to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of our intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets. 
 At the same time that we entered into the current commercial license agreement with SDC, we also entered into a material purchase agreement with SDC, which lasts for the same term as the license agreement and is subject to the same extension option. This new material purchase agreement replaced a previous purchase agreement that had been in place since 2018. Under the material purchase agreement, SDC agrees to purchase from us a minimum amount of red and green phosphorescent emitter materials for use in the manufacture of licensed products. This minimum commitment is subject to SDC s requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and our ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement. 
 In 2015, we entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display), which were effective as of January 1, 2015. The terms of these agreements were extended by a January 1, 2021 amendment through the end of 2025. The patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under our patent portfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sales of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the life of the agreements as well as minimum royalty revenue. 
 In 2023, we entered into new long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE). Under these agreements, we have granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. We also supply phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE for use in its licensed products. 
 In 2019, we entered into an evaluation and commercial supply relationship with Wuhan China Star Optoelectronics Semiconductor Display Technology Co., Ltd. (CSOT). In 2020, we entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with CSOT. Under these agreements, we have granted CSOT non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. We also supply phosphorescent OLED materials to CSOT for use in its licensed products. 
 In 2024, we entered into new long-term, multi-year agreements with Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox). Under these agreements, we have granted Visionox non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. Additionally, we supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products. 
 In 2016, we entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma Micro-electronics Co., Ltd. (Tianma). Under the license agreement, we have granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on Tianma s sales of licensed products. Additionally, we supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. In 2021, we mutually agreed to extend the terms of both the patent license and material purchase agreements for an additional multi-year term. 
 In 2016, we acquired Adesis, Inc. (Adesis) which has operations in New Castle and Wilmington, Delaware. Adesis is a contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) that provides support services on a contractual basis to third-party customers in the OLED, pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries. As of September 30, 2024, Adesis employed a team of 137 research scientists, chemists, engineers and laboratory technicians. Prior to our acquisition of Adesis, we utilized more than 50 of Adesis technology service and production output. We continue to utilize a significant portion of its technology research capacity for the benefit of our OLED technology development, and Adesis uses the remaining capacity to operate as a CDMO by providing contract research services for non-OLED applications to third-party customers in the above-mentioned industries. Contract research services revenue is earned by providing chemical materials synthesis research, development and commercialization for non-OLED applications on a contractual basis for those third-party customers. 
 In June 2020, a wholly-owned subsidiary, OVJP Corporation (OVJP Corp), was formed as a Delaware corporation. Based in California, OVJP Corp was founded to advance the commercialization of our proprietary Organic Vapor Jet Printing (OVJP) technology. As of September 30, 2024, OVJP Corp employed a team of 26 research, mechanical, electrical and software engineers and laboratory technicians. As a direct printing technique, OVJP technology has the potential to offer high deposition rates for large-area OLEDs. In addition, OVJP technology reduces OLED material waste associated with use of a shadow mask (i.e., the waste of material that deposits on the shadow mask itself when fabricating an OLED). By comparison to inkjet printing, an OVJP process does not use liquid solvents and therefore the OLED materials utilized are not limited by their viscosity or solvent solubility. OVJP also avoids generation of solvent wastes and eliminates the additional step of removing residual solvent from the OLED device. We believe the successful implementation of the OVJP technology has the potential to increase the addressable market for large-size OLED panels while also serving another potential growth market for our proprietary PHOLED materials and technologies. 
 28 

In February 2021, we announced the establishment of a new manufacturing site in Shannon, Ireland and an agreement between UDC Ireland Limited and PPG for the production of our OLED materials. We purchased the site during September 2023. When fully operational, the new facility is expected to double our production capacity and allow for the diversification of our manufacturing base for phosphorescent emitters. The first phase of facility improvements has been completed and operations commenced in June 2022. 
 We also generate technology development and support revenue earned from development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization assistance fees. 
 We anticipate fluctuations in our annual and quarterly results of operations due to uncertainty regarding, among other factors: 
 the timing, cost and volume of sales of our OLED materials; 

the timing of our receipt of license fees and royalties, as well as fees for future technology development and evaluation; 

the timing and magnitude of expenditures we may incur in connection with our ongoing research and development and patent-related activities; and 

the timing and financial consequences of our formation of new business relationships and alliances.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the adjustment resulted from an increase in the average price per gram that was primarily due to the decrease in anticipated demand by several of our customers over the remaining lives of their contracts. 
 Contract research services revenue was 3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 35 . The increase in contract research services revenue was primarily due to the timing of completion of several contract research projects by our subsidiary, Adesis, during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Revenue from contract research services consists of revenue earned by Adesis, which provides support services on a contractual basis to third-party customers in the pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries. 
 Cost of sales 
 Cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 1.6 million as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to product mix and an increase in unit material volume. As a result of the increase in revenue from royalty and license fees, partially offset by a decrease in revenue from material sales, gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 19.0 million as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, with gross margin as a percentage of revenue increasing to 78 from 76 . 
 Research and development 
 Research and development expenses increased to 36.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 33.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher operating costs, including increased PPG development activity. 
 Selling, general and administrative 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 15.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 18.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to lower employee-related expenses, including incentive and stock-based compensation expenses. 
 Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets 
 Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets was 4.6 million for both three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Patent costs 
 Patent costs decreased to 2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Royalty and license expense 
 Royalty and license expense increased to 154,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 81,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest and other income, net 
 Interest income, net was 10.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 7.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest income, net was primarily due to an increase in bond yields on available-for-sale investments held during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 as well as higher available-for-sale investment balances. Other income (loss), net primarily consisted of net exchange gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, net investment gains and losses, and rental income. We recorded other income, net of 3.8 
 30 

million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to other loss, net of 1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Income tax expense 
 We are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was 17.9 and 4.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and we recorded income tax expense of 14.5 million and 2.4 million, respectively, for those periods. During the third quarter of 2023, a change in the U.S. tax regulations associated with the ability to credit Chinese withholding taxes, as well as a change in the capitalization rules for research and development expenses resulted in a decrease in the effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Revenue 
 Our total material sales were 272.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 239.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 13 with an increase in unit material volume of 19 . The increase in material sales was primarily due to strengthened demand for our emitter materials, partially offset by changes in customer mix. 
 Green emitter sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which include our yellow-green emitters, were 205.0 million as compared to 180.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, with unit material volumes increasing by 17 . 

Red emitter sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 63.3 million as compared to 54.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, with unit material volumes increasing by 27 . 

Revenue from royalty and license fees was 202.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 165.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 22 . The increase in royalty and license fees was primarily the result of higher unit material volume and changes in customer mix. 
 
 The cumulative catch-up adjustment recorded to revenue arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net was an increase of 6.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 5.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the adjustment resulted from an increase in the average price per gram that was primarily due to the decrease in anticipated demand by several of the Company's customers over the remaining lives of their contracts. 
 31 

Contract research services revenue was 10.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 12.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 15 . The decrease in contract research services revenue was primarily due to the timing of completion of several contract research projects by our subsidiary, Adesis, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Revenue from contract research services consists of revenue earned by Adesis, which provides support services on a contractual basis to third-party customers in the pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries. 
 Cost of sales 
 Cost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 11.8 million as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in the level of materials sales and product mix, partially offset by a 4.0 million decrease in inventory reserve expense. As a result of the increase in revenue from royalty and licenses fees and material sales, gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 55.5 million as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, with gross margin as a percentage of revenue increasing to 77 from 76 . 
 Research and development 
 Research and development expenses increased to 110.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 96.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher operating costs, including increased PPG development activity, employee-related expenses and contract research costs. 
 Selling, general and administrative 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 54.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 50.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in employee-related expenses, including higher stock-based compensation and salaries expenses. 
 Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets 
 Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets was 13.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 11.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to the commencement of amortization expense associated with the Merck KGaA patent acquisition that was completed on April 28, 2023. 
 Patent costs 
 Patent costs decreased to 6.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 7.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Royalty and license expense 
 Royalty and license expense increased to 1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 414,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to a one-time expense of 1.5 million in connection with an amendment to our existing amended license agreement, effective as of October 9, 1997, with Princeton University and the University of Southern California. 
 Interest and other income, net 
 Interest income, net was 30.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 20.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest income, net was primarily due to an increase in bond yields on available-for-sale investments held during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as well as higher available-for-sale investment balances. Other income (loss), net primarily consisted of net exchange gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, net investment gains and losses, and rental income. We recorded other income, net of 416,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to other loss, net of 3.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Income tax expense 
 We are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was 18.8 and 16.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and we recorded income tax expense of 40.8 million and 28.5 million, respectively, for those periods. 
 32 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 79.6 million, short-term investments of 472.0 million, and long-term U.S. Government bonds investments of 378.8 million for a total of 930.4 million. This compares to cash and cash equivalents of 92.0 million, short-term investments of 422.1 million, and long-term U.S. Government bond investments of 285.5 million for a total of 799.6 million as of December 31, 2023. 
 Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 219.0 million resulting from 176.1 million of net income, 39.5 million from non-cash items including stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization of intangibles, and 3.4 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities related to a decrease in accounts receivable of 52.2 million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 9.4 million, partially offset by an increase in other assets of 43.7 million, a decrease in deferred revenue of 10.0 million, a decrease in other liabilities of 4.3 million and an increase in inventory of 163,000. 
 Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 117.7 million resulting from 141.0 million of net income and 50.7 million from non-cash items including depreciation, stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles, partially offset by 74.0 million reduction due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities related to an increase in accounts receivable of 29.5 million, an increase in other assets of 29.4 million, a decrease in other liabilities of 28.7 million and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expense of 32,000, partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue of 11.8 million and a decrease in inventory of 1.8 million. 
 Cash used in investing activities was 167.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 75.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to timing of maturities and purchases of investments resulting in net purchases of 137.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net sales and maturities of 43.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, partially offset by a decrease in purchases of intangibles and property, plant and equipment of 88.8 million. The decrease in the purchases of intangibles and property, plant and equipment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the Merck KGaA patent acquisition on April 28, 2023. 
 Cash used in financing activities was 64.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 56.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to an increase in the cash payment of dividends in the current year of 7.8 million and an increase in the payment of withholding taxes related to stock-based compensation to employees of 356,000, partially offset by an increase in the proceeds from the issuance of common stock of 244,000. 
 Working capital was 810.7 million as of September 30, 2024, as compared to 798.3 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases in short-term investments and other current assets, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable. 
 We anticipate, based on our internal forecasts and assumptions relating to our operations (including, among others, assumptions regarding our working capital requirements, the progress of our research and development efforts, the availability of sources of funding for our research and development work, and the timing and costs associated with the preparation, filing, prosecution, maintenance, defense and enforcement of our patents and patent applications), that we have sufficient cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to meet our obligations for at least the next twelve months. 
 We believe that potential additional financing sources for us include long-term and short-term borrowings and public and private sales of our equity and debt securities. It should be noted, however, that additional funding may be required in the future for research, development and commercialization of our OLED technologies and materials, to obtain, maintain and enforce patents respecting these technologies and materials, and for working capital and other purposes, the timing and amount of which are difficult to ascertain. There can be no assurance that additional funds will be available to us when needed, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, particularly in the current economic environment. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and other financial information. Actual results may differ significantly from our estimates under other assumptions and conditions. 
 33 

We believe that our accounting policies related to revenue recognition and deferred revenue, inventories, and income taxes are our critical accounting policies as contemplated by the SEC. 
 Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for additional discussion of our critical accounting policies. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a discussion of our contractual obligations. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements in the nature of guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities (or similar arrangements serving as credit, liquidity or market risk support to unconsolidated entities for any such assets), or obligations (including contingent obligations) arising out of variable interests in unconsolidated entities providing financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engage in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us. 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes and hold no derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments that could expose us to significant market risk other than our investments disclosed in Fair Value Measurements in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We generally invest in investment grade financial instruments to reduce our exposure related to investments. Our primary market risk exposure with regard to such financial instruments is to changes in interest rates, which would impact interest income earned on investments. However, based upon the conservative nature of our investment portfolio and current experience, we do not believe a decrease in investment yields would have a material negative effect on our interest income. 
 Substantially all our revenue is derived from outside of North America. All revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars and therefore we bear no significant foreign exchange risk. 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report, are effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. However, a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II OTHE R INFORMATION 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 Patent Related Challenges and Oppositions 
 Each major jurisdiction in the world that issues patents provides both third parties and applicants an opportunity to seek a further review of an issued patent. The process for requesting and considering such reviews is specific to the jurisdiction that issued the patent in question, and generally does not provide for claims of monetary damages or a review of specific claims of infringement. The 
 34 

conclusions made by the reviewing administrative bodies tend to be appealable and generally are limited in scope and applicability to the specific claims and jurisdiction in question. 
 We believe that opposition proceedings are frequently commenced in the ordinary course of business by third parties who may believe that one or more claims in a patent do not comply with the technical or legal requirements of the specific jurisdiction in which the patent was issued. We view these proceedings as reflective of its goal of obtaining the broadest legally permissible patent coverage permitted in each jurisdiction. Once a proceeding is initiated, as a general matter, the issued patent continues to be presumed valid until the jurisdiction s applicable administrative body issues a final non-appealable decision. Depending on the jurisdiction, the outcome of these proceedings could include affirmation, denial or modification of some or all of the originally issued claims. We believe that as OLED technology becomes more established and its patent portfolio increases in size, so will the number of these proceedings. 
 ITEM 1A. RI SK FACTORS 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors previously discussed in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUI TY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 None. 
 ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPO N SENIOR SECURITIES 
 None. 
 ITEM 4. MINE SAF ETY DISCLOSURES 
 Not applicable. 
 ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION 
 Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024 , none of our directors or executive officers into, or , contracts, instructions or written plans for the sale or purchase of our securities that were intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1.
