We continue to update and expand our qualitative framework to further address factors not captured in the quantitative process. million. Large pools of homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for loss and reserved at the pool level. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as nonaccrual, provided that management expects to collect all amounts due, including interest accrued at the contractual interest rate for the period of delay.

 billion and billion, respectively, of held to maturity securities and no related valuation account. The Company follows its nonaccrual policy by reversing interest income in the income statement when the Company determines the interest for held to maturity securities is uncollectible. Therefore, management excludes the accrued interest receivable balance from the amortized cost basis in measuring expected credit losses on the investment securities and does not record an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the accrued interest receivables for all investment securities recorded in Other Assets were million and million, respectively. ACL Loans and Certain Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposures The ACL for loans held for investment reflects management s estimate of credit losses that will result from the inability of our borrowers to make required loan payments. The Company makes adjustments to the ACL by recording a provision for or recovery of credit losses through earnings. Loans charged off are recorded as reductions to the ACL on the balance sheet and subsequent recoveries of loan charge-offs are recorded as increases to the ACL when they are received. Management estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, credit quality, or term, as well as for changes in macroeconomic conditions, such as changes in unemployment rates, gross domestic product, property values, or other relevant factors. The Company s estimate of its ACL involves a high degree of judgment; therefore, management s process for determining expected losses may result in a range of expected losses. The Company s ACL recorded in the balance sheet reflects management s best estimate within the range of expected losses. The Company recognizes in net income the amount needed to adjust the ACL for management s current estimate of expected losses. The Company generally uses an eight-quarter forecast period, based on a single forecast scenario or a blend of multiple forecast scenarios, using variables management believes are most relevant to each portfolio segment. For periods beyond which management is able to develop reasonable and supportable forecasts, the Company reverts to the average historical loss rate, reflecting historical default probabilities and loss severities, using a reversion speed that approximates four quarters. The forecast period and scenarios used are reviewed on a quarterly basis and may be adjusted based on management's view of the current economic conditions and level of predictability the forecast can provide. While quantitative allowance methodologies strive to reflect all risk factors, any estimate involves assumptions and uncertainties resulting in some level of imprecision. Imprecision exists in the estimation process due to the inherent time lag between obtaining information, performing the calculation, as well as variations between estimates and actual outcomes. As a result, amounts determined under the methodologies described above are adjusted by management to consider the potential impact of other qualitative factors not captured in the quantitative model adjustments which include, but are not limited to, the following: imprecision or conditions not captured in economic scenario assumptions, emerging risks related to either changes in the internal or external environment that are affecting specific portfolios, trends in loan or portfolio level credit metrics not captured in quantitative modeling, or model imprecision adjustments. The consideration of these items results in adjustments to allowance amounts included in the Company s allowance for credit losses for each loan portfolio. The Company s ACL is calculated using collectively evaluated and individually evaluated loans. Even though portions of the allowance may be allocated to specific loans or pools of loans, the entire allowance is available for any credit that, in management s judgment, should be charged off.

 million to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty are estimated on an individual basis. Because the effect of the remainder of modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is already incorporated into the measurement methodologies used to estimate the allowance, they are accounted for as pooled loans. For purchased credit-deteriorated, otherwise referred to herein as PCD, assets are defined as acquired individual financial assets (or acquired groups of financial assets with similar risk characteristics) that, as of the date of acquisition, have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination, as determined by the Company s assessment. The Company records acquired PCD loans by adding the expected credit losses (i.e., allowance for credit losses) to the purchase price of the financial assets rather than recording through the provision for credit losses in the income statement. The expected credit loss, as of the acquisition day, of a PCD loan is added to the allowance for credit losses. The non-credit discount or premium is the difference between the unpaid principal balance and the amortized cost basis as of the acquisition date. Subsequent to the acquisition date, the change in the ACL on PCD loans is recognized through the Provision for Credit Losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The non-credit discount or premium is accreted or amortized, respectively, into interest income over the remaining life of the PCD loan on a level-yield basis. The Company follows its nonaccrual policy by reversing contractual interest income in the income statement when the Company places a loan on nonaccrual status. Therefore, management excludes the accrued interest receivable balance from the amortized cost basis in measuring expected credit losses on the portfolio and does not record an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the accrued interest receivables for loans recorded in Other Assets were million and million, respectively. The Company has a variety of assets that have a component that qualifies as an off-balance sheet exposure. These primarily include undrawn portions of revolving lines of credit and standby letters of credit. The expected losses associated with these exposures within the unfunded portion of the expected credit loss are recorded as a liability on the balance sheet. Management has determined that a majority of the Company s off-balance sheet credit exposures are not unconditionally cancellable. Management completes funding studies based on internal historical data to estimate the percentage of unfunded loan commitments that will ultimately be funded to calculate the reserve for unfunded commitments. Management applies this funding rate, along with the loss factor rate determined for each pooled loan segment, to unfunded loan commitments, excluding unconditionally cancellable exposures and letters of credit, to arrive at the reserve for unfunded loan commitments. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the liabilities recorded for expected credit losses on unfunded commitments were million and million, respectively. The current adjustment to the reserve for unfunded commitments is recognized through the Provision for Credit Losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The methodology used in the estimation of the allowance, which is performed at least quarterly, is designed to be dynamic and responsive to changes in portfolio credit quality and forecasted economic conditions. Changes are reflected in the pool-basis allowance and in reserves assigned on an individual basis as the collectability of classified loans is evaluated with new information. As the Company s portfolio has matured, historical loss ratios have been closely monitored. The review of the appropriateness of the allowance is performed by executive management and presented to the Audit and Risk Committees of the Board of Directors for their review. The committees report to the board as part of the board's quarterly review of the Company s consolidated financial statements.

Additionally, the proportional amortization method does not require deferred taxes be tracked as was the case with the equity method; therefore, deferred taxes of were written-off as an additional reduction to retained earnings effective January 1, 2024. Issued But Not Yet Adopted Accounting Standards In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures , to improve disclosures about a public entity s reportable segments and address requests from investors and other allocators of capital for additional, more detailed information about a reportable segment s expenses. Segment information gives investors an understanding of overall performance and is key to assessing potential future cash flows. In addition, although information about a segment s revenue and measure of profit or loss is disclosed in an entity s financial statements, there is limited information disclosed about a segment s expenses. The key amendments include annual and interim disclosures of significant expenses and other segment items that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included within each reported measure of profit or loss, as well as any other key measure of performance used for segment management decisions. This ASU also requires disclosure of key profitability measures used in assessing performance and how to allocate resources. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not anticipate this ASU will have a material impact on its financial statements . In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures , which aims to address requests for improved income tax disclosures from investors, lenders, creditors and other allocators of capital (collectively, investors that use the financial statements to make capital allocation decisions. The amendments in this ASU address investor requests for more transparency about income tax information, including jurisdictional information, by requiring consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in both the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company does not anticipate this ASU will have a material impact on its financial statements.

As part of the ongoing monitoring of the credit quality of our loan portfolio, management tracks certain credit quality indicators, including trends related to (i) the level of classified loans, (ii) net charge-offs, (iii) non-performing loans (see details below), and (iv) the general economic conditions of the markets that we serve. The Company utilizes a risk grading matrix to assign a risk grade to each commercial loan. Classified loans are assessed at a minimum every six months. A description of the general characteristics of the risk grades is as follows: Pass These loans range from minimal credit risk to average, however, still acceptable credit risk. Special mention A special mention loan has potential weaknesses that deserve Management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or the institution s credit position at some future date. Substandard A substandard loan is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified must have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses, that may jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. A substandard loan is characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful A doubtful loan has all of the weaknesses inherent in one classified as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of the currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. Construction and land development loans in the following table are on commercial and speculative real estate. Consumer owner-occupied loans are collateralized by 1-4 family owner-occupied property with a business intent.

 Industrial Other Commercial non-owner-occupied real estate Retail Other Office Commercial and industrial Other Other income producing property 1-4 family investment property Home equity loans Residential 1-4 family dwelling Total collateral dependent loans The Bank designates individually evaluated loans on non-accrual with a net book balance exceeding the designated threshold as collateral dependent loans. Collateral dependent loans are loans for which the repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. These loans do not share common risk characteristics and are not included within the collectively evaluated loans for determining the ACL. Under ASC 326-20-35-6, the Bank has adopted the collateral maintenance practical expedient to measure the ACL based on the fair value of collateral. The ACL is calculated on an individual loan basis based on the shortfall between the fair value of the loan's collateral, which is adjusted for selling costs, and amortized cost. If the fair value of the collateral exceeds the amortized cost, no allowance is required. The Bank s threshold for individually evaluated loans is million. The changes above in collateral percentage are due to appraisal value updates or changes in the number of loans within the asset class and collateral type. Overall collateral dependent loans decreased million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Loans on nonaccrual status at the date of modification are initially classified as nonaccrual. Loans on accruing status at the date of modification are initially classified as accruing if the note is reasonably assured of repayment and performance is expected in accordance with its modified terms. Such loans may be designated as nonaccrual loans subsequent to the modification date if reasonable doubt exists as to the collection of interest or principal under the modification agreement. Nonaccrual loans are returned to accruing status when there is economic substance to the modification, there is documented credit evaluation of the borrower s financial condition, the remaining balance is reasonably assured of repayment in accordance with its modified terms, and the borrower has demonstrated sustained repayment performance in accordance with the modified terms for a reasonable period of time (generally a minimum of ). See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for how such modifications are factored into the determination of the ACL for the periods presented above .

We maintain operating leases on land and buildings for some of our operating centers, branch facilities and ATM locations. Most leases include one or more , with renewal terms extending up to . The exercise of renewal options is based on the sole judgment of management and what they consider to be reasonably certain given the environment today. Factors in determining whether an option is reasonably certain of exercise include, but are not limited to, the value of leasehold improvements, the value of renewal rate compared to market rates, and the presence of factors that would cause a significant economic penalty to us if the option is not exercised. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet and instead are recognized in lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

These leases are all real estate leases. Terms and conditions are similar to those real estate operating leases described above. Lease classifications from the acquired institutions were retained. At September 30, 2024, we did not maintain any leases with related parties, and determined that the number and dollar amount of our equipment leases was immaterial. As of September 30, 2024, we had additional operating leases that have not yet commenced. Equipment Lessor SouthState has an Equipment Finance Group which goes to market through intermediaries. The Equipment Finance Group primarily focuses on serving the construction and utility segments. Lease terms typically range from to . At the end of the lease term, the lessee has the option to renew the lease, return the equipment, or purchase the equipment. In the event the equipment is returned, there is a remarketing agreement with the intermediary to sell the equipment. The Equipment Finance Group offers the following lease products: TRAC Leases, Split-TRAC Leases, and FMV Leases. Direct finance equipment leases are included in commercial and industrial loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The estimated residual values for direct finance leases are established by an approved intermediary who utilizes internally developed analyses, external studies, and/or third-party appraisals to establish a residual position. FMV and Split-TRAC leases have residual risk due to their unguaranteed residual value whereas TRAC leases have a guaranteed residual value. Expected credit losses on direct financing leases and the related estimated residual values are included in the Commercial and Industrial loan segment for the ACL.

There have been stock options issued during the first nine months of 2024. Because all outstanding stock options had vested as of December 31, 2023, there was unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock option grants under the plans or fair value of shares vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The intrinsic value of stock option shares exercised for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was . Restricted Stock From time-to-time, we grant shares of restricted stock to key employees. These awards help align the interests of these employees with the interests of our shareholders by providing economic value directly related to increases in the value of our stock. The value of the stock awarded is established as the fair market value of the stock at the time of the grant. We recognize expenses equal to the total value of such awards, ratably over the vesting period of the stock grants. Restricted stock grants to employees generally vest ratably over a two to four-year vesting period. All restricted stock agreements are conditioned upon continued employment. Termination of employment prior to a vesting date, as described below, would terminate any interest in non-vested shares. Prior to vesting of the shares, as long as employed by the Company, the employees will have the right to vote such shares and to receive dividends paid with respect to such shares. All restricted shares will fully vest in the event of change in control of the Company or upon the death of the recipient. Nonvested restricted stock for 2024 is summarized in the following table. Vested ) Forfeited ) Nonvested at September 30, 2024 As of September 30, 2024, there was of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested restricted stock granted under the plans.

Restricted Stock Units RSUs From time-to-time, we also grant performance RSUs and time-vested RSUs to key employees, and time-vested RSUs to non-employee directors. These awards help align the interests of these employees with the interests of our shareholders by providing economic value directly related to our performance. Some performance RSU grants contain a three-year performance period while others contain a one to two-year performance period and a time-vested requirement (generally two to four years from the grant date). The performance-based awards for our long-term incentive plans are dependent on the achievement of tangible book value growth and return on average tangible common equity relative to the Company s peer group during each three-year performance period. Grants to non-employee directors typically vest within a 12-month period. We communicate threshold, target, and maximum performance RSU awards and performance targets to the applicable key employees at the beginning of a performance period. Due to the merger with CenterState on June 7, 2020, all legacy and assumed performance-based restricted stock units converted to a time-vesting requirement. With respect to some long-term incentive awards, dividend equivalents are accrued at the same rate as cash dividends paid for each share of the Company s common stock during the performance or time-vested period, and subsequently paid when the shares are issued on the vesting or settlement date. The value of the RSUs awarded is established as the fair market value

See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for discussion of liability recorded for expected credit losses on unfunded commitments . We have been named as defendant in various legal actions, arising from its normal business activities, in which damages in various amounts are claimed. We are also exposed to litigation risk related to the prior business activities of banks acquired through whole bank acquisitions. Although the amount of any ultimate liability with respect to such matters cannot be determined, in the opinion of management, as of September 30, 2024, any such liability is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. Cyber Incident Litigation . On April 3, 2024, a putative class action lawsuit was filed against the Bank in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division (the Original Suit ). The plaintiff, who purports to represent the class of individuals harmed by alleged actions and/or omissions by the Bank in connection with the cybersecurity incident that was detected on February 6, 2024 (the Cyber Incident ), asserts a variety of common law and statutory claims seeking monetary damages, injunctive relief and other related relief related to the potential unauthorized access by third parties to personal identifiable information. While the Original Suit has been voluntarily dismissed, additional plaintiffs have initiated litigation that names the Bank as a defendant. As of September 30, 2024, one consolidated putative class action is pending against the Bank in the Circuit Court for Polk County, Florida (the Cyber Incident Suit ). At this time, neither the Bank nor the Company is able to reasonably estimate the amount or range of reasonably possible loss, if any, that might result from the Cyber Incident Suit. However, the Bank believes that it has defenses to the claims and intends to vigorously defend against the Cyber Incident Suit. Accordingly, no amounts have been recorded in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the Cyber Incident Suit. The Company will continue to evaluate information as it becomes known and will record an estimate for losses at the time or times when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Additional lawsuits and claims related to the Cyber Incident may be asserted by or on behalf of customers, shareholders, or others seeking damages or other related relief and additional inquiries from governmental agencies may be received or investigations by governmental agencies commence d.

 Bank properties held for sale Individually evaluated loans December 31, 2023: OREO Bank properties held for sale Individually evaluated loans For an individually evaluated loan, the fair value of collateral is measured based on appraisal or third-party valuation when the loan is placed on nonaccrual. For OREO and bank properties held for sale, the fair value is initially recorded based on external appraisals at the time of transfer. These assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are updated on at least an annual basis. Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurement OREO and Bank properties held for sale Discounted appraisals Collateral discounts and estimated costs to sell Fair Value of Financial Instruments We used the following methods and assumptions in estimating our fair value disclosures for financial instruments. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. Those models are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rates and estimates of future cash flows. In that regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, could not be realized in immediate settlement of the instrument. The use of different methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. The fair value estimates presented in the table below are based on pertinent information available to management as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Such amounts have not been revalued for purposes of these consolidated financial statements since those dates and, therefore, current estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein.

 (1) The fair value of the interest rate swap derivative assets was reduced by million in variation margin payments applicable to swaps centrally cleared through LCH and CME. Balance Sheet Fair Value Hedge As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company maintained loan swaps, with an aggregate notional amount of million and million, respectively, accounted for as fair value hedges. The amortized cost basis of the loans being hedged were million and million, respectively, as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. This derivative protects us from interest rate risk caused by changes in the SOFR curve in relation to a certain designated fixed rate loan. The derivative converts the fixed rate loan to a floating rate. Settlement occurs in any given period where there is a difference in the stated fixed rate and variable rate and the difference is recorded in net interest income. The fair value of this hedge is recorded in either other assets or in other liabilities depending on the position of the hedge with the offset recorded in loans. Non-designated Hedges of Interest Rate Risk Customer Swap The Company maintains interest rate swap contracts with loan customers of respondent bank customers of the Correspondent Banking Division, in addition to loan customers of the Bank, that are classified as non-designated hedges and are not speculative in nature. These agreements are designed to convert customers variable rate loans with the Company and respondent bank customers to fixed rate. These interest rate swaps are executed with loan customers to facilitate a respective risk management strategy and allow the customer to pay a fixed rate of interest to the Company. These interest rate swaps are simultaneously hedged by executing offsetting interest rate swaps with unrelated market counterparties to minimize the net risk exposure to the Company resulting from the transactions and allow the Company to receive a variable rate of interest. The interest rate swaps pay and receive interest based on a one-month SOFR floating rate plus a credit spread, with payments being calculated on the notional amount. The variation margin settlement payment and the related derivative instruments fair value are considered a single unit of account for accounting and financial reporting purposes. Depending on the net position of the swaps with LCH and CME, the fair value, net of the variation margin, is reported in Derivative Assets or Derivative Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, the expense or income attributable to the variation margin for the centrally cleared swaps with LCH and CME is reported in Noninterest Income, specifically within Correspondent and Capital Markets Income. The daily settlement of the derivative exposure does not change or reset the contractual terms of the instrument.

 billion and billion, respectively. At September 30, 2024, the fair value of the interest rate swap derivatives is recorded in Other Assets at million and in Other Liabilities at million. The fair value of derivative assets at September 30, 2024, was reduced by million in variation margin payments applicable to swaps centrally cleared through LCH and CME. At December 31, 2023, the fair value of the interest rate swap derivatives was recorded in Other Assets at million and Other Liabilities at million. The fair value of derivative assets at December 31, 2023, was reduced by million in variation margin payments applicable to swaps centrally cleared through LCH and CME. All changes in fair value are recorded through earnings within Correspondent and Capital Markets Income, a component of Noninterest Income on the Consolidated Statements of Income. There was a net loss of and recorded on these derivatives for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. There was a net gain of and recorded on these derivatives for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we provided million of cash collateral on the customer swaps, which is included in Cash and Cash Equivalents on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Deposits in Other Financial Institutions (Restricted Cash). We also provided million in investment securities at market value as collateral on the customer swaps which is included in Investment Securities available for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Counterparties provided million of cash collateral to the Company to secure swap asset positions that were not centrally cleared, which is included in Interest-bearing Deposits within Total Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Balance Sheet Economic Hedge During the third quarter of 2023, management began executing a series of short-term interest rate hedges to address monthly accrual mismatches related to the Company s Assumable Rate Conversion ARC program and its transition from LIBOR to SOFR after June 30, 2023. The Company is required to execute the correspondent side of its back-to-back swaps with customers with the central clearinghouses (CME or LCH). Term SOFR was not available to execute through CME and LCH, and therefore, management elected to convert to the CME-eligible daily SOFR. Because many of the respondent bank customers converted to Term SOFR, this created interest rate basis risk. To address this risk, monthly interest rate hedges were executed to minimize the impact of accrual mismatches between the monthly Term SOFR used by the customer and the daily SOFR rates used by the central clearinghouses. As of September 30, 2024, the Company maintained an aggregate notional amount of billion short-term interest rate hedges that were accounted for as economic hedges. As noted above, the derivatives protect the Company from interest rate risk caused by changes in the term and daily SOFR accrual mismatches. The fair value of these hedges is recorded in either Other Assets or in Other Liabilities depending on the position of the hedge with the offset recorded in Correspondent Banking and Capital Market Income, a component of Noninterest Income on the Consolidated Statements of Income. There was a net gain of and for these derivatives for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. There was a net loss of for these derivatives for the year ended December 31, 2023. Foreign Exchange The Company may enter into foreign exchange contracts with customers to accommodate their need to convert certain foreign currencies into U.S. Dollars. To offset the foreign exchange risk, the Company may enter into substantially identical agreements with an unrelated market counterparty to hedge these foreign exchange contracts. If there were foreign currency contracts outstanding at September 30, 2024, the fair value of these contracts would be included in Other Assets and Other Liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. All changes in fair value are recorded as other noninterest income. There was gain or loss recorded related to the foreign exchange derivative for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023. Mortgage Banking The Company also has derivatives contracts that are not classified as accounting hedges to mitigate risks related to the Company s mortgage banking activities. These instruments may include financial forwards, futures contracts, and options written and purchased, which are used to hedge MSRs; while forward sales commitments are typically used to hedge the mortgage pipeline. Such instruments derive their cash flows, and therefore their values, by reference to an underlying instrument, index or referenced interest rate. The Company does not elect hedge accounting treatment for any of these derivative instruments and as a result, changes in fair value of the instruments (both gains and losses) are recorded in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income in Mortgage Banking Income.

The minimum required leverage ratio is . The minimum required total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio is . In order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executives, a covered banking organization is also required to maintain a capital conservation buffer in addition to its minimum risk-based capital requirements. This buffer is required to consist solely of CET1, and the buffer applies to all three risk-based measurements (CET1, Tier 1 capital and total capital). The capital conservation buffer consists of an additional amount of Tier 1 common equity equal to of risk-weighted assets. The Bank is also subject to the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, which identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions (well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized) and is based on specified thresholds for each of the three risk-based regulatory capital ratios (CET1, Tier 1 capital and total capital) and for the leverage ratio.

With the implementation of ASU 2016-13 in January 2020, the Company recorded additional allowance for credit losses for loans of million, deferred tax assets of million, an additional reserve for unfunded commitments of million and an adjustment to retained earnings of million. Instead of recognizing the effects from ASU 2016-13 at adoption, the standard included a transitional method option for recognizing the adoption date effects on the Company s regulatory capital calculations over a three-year phase-in. In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the regulatory agencies provided an additional transitional method option of a two-year deferral for the start of the three-year phase-in of the recognition of the adoption date effects of ASU 2016-13 along with an option to defer the current impact on regulatory capital calculations of ASU 2016-13 during the first two years 5-year method ). Under this 5-year method, the Company would recognize an estimate of the previous incurred loss method for determining the allowance for credit losses in regulatory capital calculations and the difference from the CECL method would be deferred for two years. After two years, the effects from adoption date and the deferral difference from the first two years of applying CECL would be phased-in over three years using the straight-line method. The regulatory rules provided a one-time opportunity at the end of the first quarter of 2020 for covered banking organizations to choose its transition option for CECL. The Company chose the 5-year method and is deferring the recognition of the effects from adoption date and the CECL difference from the first two years of application. This amount was fixed as of December 31, 2021, and that amount began the three-year phase out in the first quarter of 2022 with the final being phased out in 2024 . billion at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023.

Other intangibles are amortized using either the straight-line method or an accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives, with lives generally between two and . The Company applies fair value accounting to the Company s SBA servicing asset. The change in fair value of the SBA servicing asset is recorded in SBA Income, a component of Noninterest Income on the Consolidated Statements of Income, during each applicable reporting period. As a result of the fair value accounting treatment, the Company does not amortize the SBA servicing asset and therefore excludes the SBA servicing asset from the future amortization expense table presented below. The fair value of the SBA servicing asset was million and million, respectively, at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. The fair value of the SBA servicing asset is included in Core Deposit and Other Intangibles on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Estimated amortization expense for other intangibles for each of the next five quarters is as follows: March 31, 2025 June 30, 2025 September 30, 2025 December 31, 2025 Thereafter billion and billion, respectively, as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023.

The amounts of contractually specified servicing fees we earned during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, were million, million, million, and million, respectively. Servicing fees are recorded in Mortgage Banking Income in our Consolidated Statements of Income. At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, MSRs were million and million on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively. MSRs are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded as a component of Mortgage Banking Income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The market value adjustments related to MSRs recorded in Mortgage Banking Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, were losses of million and million compared with gains of million and million, respectively. The Company has used various free standing derivative instruments to mitigate the income statement effect of changes in fair value resulting from changes in market value adjustments, in addition to changes in valuation inputs and assumptions related to MSRs.

Table of Contents) ) Decay of MSRs ) ) ) ) Gain (loss) related to derivatives ) ) ) Net effect on Consolidated Statements of Income ) ) ) ) The fair value of MSRs is highly sensitive to changes in assumptions and is determined by estimating the present value of the asset s future cash flows utilizing market-based prepayment rates, discount rates and other assumptions validated through comparison to trade information, industry surveys and with the use of independent third-party appraisals. Changes in prepayment speed assumptions have the most significant impact on the fair value of MSRs. Generally, as interest rates decline, mortgage loan prepayments accelerate due to increased refinance activity, which results in a decrease in the fair value of the MSR. Measurement of fair value is limited to the conditions existing, and the assumptions utilized as of a particular point in time, and those assumptions may not be appropriate if applied at a different time.

Changes in fair value based on changes in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the residential MSRs is calculated without changing any other assumption, while in reality changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which may either magnify or counteract the effect of the change. The derivative instruments utilized by the Company would serve to reduce the estimated impacts to fair value included in the table above.

References to the Bank means SouthState Corporation s wholly owned subsidiary, SouthState Bank, National Association, a national banking association. Overview SouthState is a financial holding company headquartered in Winter Haven, Florida, and was incorporated under the laws of South Carolina in 1985. We provide a wide range of banking services and products to our customers through our Bank. The Bank operates SouthState|DuncanWilliams Securities Corp. SouthState|DuncanWilliams ), a registered broker-dealer headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee that serves primarily institutional clients across the U.S. in the fixed income business. The Bank also operates SouthState Advisory, Inc., a wholly-owned registered investment advisor. SSB First Street Corporation, an investment subsidiary of the Bank headquartered in Wilmington, Delaware, holds tax-exempt municipal investment securities as part of the Bank s investment portfolio. The holding company also owns SSB Insurance Corp., a captive insurance subsidiary pursuant to Section 831(b) of the U.S. Tax Code. At September 30, 2024, we had approximately 46.1 billion in assets and 5,144 full-time equivalent employees. Through our Bank branches, ATMs and online banking platforms, we provide our customers with a wide range of financial products and services through a six (6) state footprint in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. These financial products and services include deposit accounts such as checking accounts, savings and time deposits of various types, safe deposit boxes, bank money orders, wire transfer and ACH services, brokerage services and alternative investment products such as annuities and mutual funds, trust and asset management services, loans of all types, including business loans, agriculture loans, real estate-secured (mortgage) loans, personal use loans, home improvement loans, automobile loans, manufactured housing loans, boat loans, credit cards, letters of credit, home equity lines of credit, treasury management services, and merchant services. We also operate a correspondent banking and capital markets division within our national bank subsidiary, of which the majority of its bond salesmen, traders and operational personnel are housed in facilities located in Atlanta, Georgia, Memphis, Tennessee, Walnut Creek, California, and Birmingham, Alabama. This division s primary revenue generating activities are related to (i) its capital markets division, which includes commissions earned on fixed income security sales, fees from hedging services, loan brokerage fees, income generated from the purchase of government guaranteed loans and sale of pooled loans, and consulting fees for services related to these activities, and (ii) its correspondent banking division, which includes spread income earned on correspondent bank deposits (i.e., federal funds purchased) and correspondent bank checking account deposits and fees from safe-keeping activities, bond accounting services for correspondents, asset/liability consulting related activities, international wires, and other clearing and corporate checking account services. We also operate Corporate Billing, a transaction-based division of the Bank headquartered in Decatur, Alabama, that provides factoring, invoicing, collection and accounts receivable management services to transportation companies and automotive parts and service providers nationwide. We have pursued, and continue to pursue, a growth strategy that focuses on organic growth, supplemented by acquisitions of select financial institutions, or branches in certain market areas. The following discussion describes our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, and also analyzes our financial condition as of September 30, 2024, as compared to December 31, 2023 . Like most financial institutions, we derive most of our income from interest we receive on our loans and investments. Our primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits, on which we may pay interest. Consequently, one of the key measures of our success is the amount of our net interest income, or the difference between the income on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and the expense on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits. Another key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on these interest-earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities.

 Of course, there are risks inherent in all loans, as such, we maintain an allowance for credit losses, otherwise referred to herein as ACL, to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible. We establish and maintain this allowance by charging a provision for credit losses against our operating earnings. In the following discussion, we have included a detailed discussion of this process. In addition to earning interest on our loans and investments, we earn income through fees and other services we charge to our customers. We incur costs in addition to interest expense on deposits and other borrowings, the largest of which is salaries and employee benefits. We describe the various components of this noninterest income and noninterest expense in the following discussion. The following sections also identify significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements. We encourage you to read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes and the other statistical information also included in this report. Recent Events Independent Bank Group, Inc. Independent Proposed Merger On May 20, 2024, SouthState and Independent announced that the two companies had entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated May 17, 2024 Merger Agreement ), which provides that upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Independent will merge with and into SouthState, with SouthState continuing as the surviving corporation in the merger. Immediately following the merger, Independent s wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Independent Bank, will merge with and into the Bank, which will continue as the surviving bank in the bank merger. The Merger Agreement was approved by the Boards of Directors of the Company and Independent by the unanimous vote of directors present at the applicable meetings and the shareholders of each of SouthState and Independent . The Merger Agreement is still subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, shareholders of Independent will receive 0.60 shares of SouthState s common stock for each share of Independent common stock they own. The transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of 2025, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of required statutory approvals. At September 30, 2024, Independent reported 18.6 billion in total assets, 14.3 billion in loans and 16.0 billion in deposits . OCC Merger Policy Statement The OCC adopted a final rule amending its procedures for reviewing applications under the Bank Merger Act BMA and adding a policy statement on the OCC s substantive approach to evaluating bank mergers under the BMA. The policy statement outlines the general principles the OCC will apply when reviewing bank merger applications and clarifies how the OCC would consider the statutory factors under the BMA. The policy statement identifies certain indicators that are more likely to withstand scrutiny and be approved expeditiously and those that would raise supervisory or regulatory concerns. Indicators generally consistent with timely approval, include, among others, appropriate capital and supervisory ratings, lack of enforcement or fair lending actions, lack of significant CRA or consumer compliance concerns or significant adverse effect on competition, and that the resulting institution would have total assets less than 50 billion. The final rule becomes effective on January 1, 2025. The Company is assessing the rule and its possible impact on the Company s strategy.

 CFPB Open Banking Rule In October 2024, the CFPB finalized a rule to implement Section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which would require certain entities, including the Company and the Bank, to, among other things, make available to a consumer, upon request, information in its control or possession concerning the consumer financial product or service that the consumer obtained from that entity. In general, the rule also requires, among other things, data providers holding a consumer account, such as the Bank, to establish a developer interface satisfying certain data security specifications and other standards, through which the data provider can receive requests for, and provide, specific types of data covered by the rule in electronic, usable form to authorized third parties, including data aggregators. Under the rule, data providers are prohibited from, among other things, charging consumers or third parties fees for processing these consumer data requests. The rule also places certain data security, authorization and other obligations on third parties accessing covered data from data providers, which could include the Company and the Bank when acting in certain capacities. The rule requires third parties to limit their collection, use, and retention of the data received to only what is reasonably necessary to provide the consumers requested product or service. The compliance date for a depository institution data provider that holds at least 10 billion in total assets but less than 250 billion in total assets is April 1, 2027; however, the final rule is subject to ongoing litigation that could impact whether and when the Company and the Bank are required to comply with the rule. We continue to evaluate the final rule and the potential impacts on the Company and the Bank. Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies in accordance with GAAP and follow general practices within the banking industry. Our financial position and results of operations are affected by management s application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses. Differences in the application of these policies could result in material changes in our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations and related disclosures. Understanding our accounting policies is fundamental to understanding our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. Accordingly, our significant accounting policies and changes in accounting principles and effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3 Recent Accounting and Regulatory Pronouncements of our consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The following is a summary of our allowance for credit losses ACL critical accounting policy, which is highly dependent on estimates, assumptions and judgments.

 Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL) The ACL reflects management s estimate of the portion of the amortized cost of loans and unfunded commitments that it does not expect to collect. Management has a methodology determining its ACL for loans held for investment and certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures. Management considers the effects of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the collectability of the loan portfolio. The Company s estimate of its ACL involves a high degree of judgment; therefore, management s process for determining expected credit losses may result in a range of expected credit losses. It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach a different reasonable conclusion. The Company s ACL recorded on the balance sheet reflects management s best estimate within the range of expected credit losses. The Company recognizes in net income the amount needed to adjust the ACL for management s current estimate of expected credit losses. See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further detailed descriptions of our estimation process and methodology related to the ACL. See also Note 7 Allowance for Credit Losses and Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL) on Loans and Certain Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposures in this MD A. One of the most significant judgments influencing the ACL is the macroeconomic forecasts from the third-party service provider. Changes in the economic forecasts may significantly affect the estimated credit losses which may potentially lead to materially different quantitatively modeled allowance levels from one reporting period to the next. Given the dynamic relationship between macroeconomic variables, it is difficult to estimate the impact of a change in any one individual variable on the ACL. SouthState uses a third-party service provider to support the economic forecast assumptions under CECL forecast by providing various levels of economic scenarios. These scenarios are weighted in accordance with management assessment of scenarios as well as expectations of the general market and industry conditions. To illustrate the sensitivity of these scenarios, if a 100 probability weighting was applied to the adverse scenario rather than using the probability-weighted three scenario approach, this would result in an increase in the ACL by approximately 206.9 million (all other things equal, including no compensating adjustments to qualitative factor adjustments). Conversely, if a 100 probability weighting was applied to the upside scenario, this would result in a decrease in the ACL by approximately 95.8 million. The adverse scenario includes assumptions including, but not limited to, elevated interest rates weakening consumers and public confidence, inflation, the conflict in the Middle East leading to a wider war, tensions between China and Taiwan interrupt trade, political risks, increased unemployment and the U.S. economy falling into recession in 2024. Conversely, the upside scenario includes assumptions such as a swift resolution of international conflicts, stabilization of consumer confidence, more than full employment, reduced political tensions, and other favorable assumptions. This sensitivity analysis and related impact on the ACL is a hypothetical analysis and is not intended to represent management s judgments or assumptions of qualitative loss factors that were utilized at September 30, 2024. Results of Operations Overview We reported consolidated net income of 143.2 million, or diluted earnings per share EPS of 1.86, for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to consolidated net income of 124.1 million, or diluted EPS of 1.62, in the comparable period of 2023, a 15.3 increase in consolidated net income and a 14.8 increase in diluted EPS. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we reported consolidated net income of 390.6 million, or diluted EPS of 5.09, as compared to consolidated net income of 387.5 million, or diluted EPS of 5.07, in the comparable period of 2023, a 0.8 increase in consolidated net income and a 0.4 increase in diluted EPS. The 19.0 million increase in consolidated net income for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 was the net result of the following items: A 43.7 million increase in interest income, resulting from a 50.3 million increase in interest income from loans and loans held for sale partially offset by a 2.2 million decrease in interest income from investment securities, and a 4.4 million decrease in interest income on federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreement to resell and interest-bearing deposits. The increase in interest income from loans was due to an increase in the yield of 34 basis points as loans continued to reprice higher from the comparatively higher rate environment in 2022 and in 2023. The Federal Reserve Bank decreased its federal funds rate by 50 basis points for the first time since early 2022, however, the rate cut took place in mid-September 2024. The increase in interest income in loans was also due to an increase in the average balance of 1.7 billion mainly through organic growth of loans held for investment. The decline in interest income from investment securities and federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreement to resell and interest-bearing deposits was mainly due to the decline in average balance of 550.1 million and 262.9 million, respectively;

 A 47.6 million increase in interest expense, which mainly resulted from a 44.0 million increase in interest expense from deposits, a 1.4 million increase in interest expense in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and 2.2 million increase in interest in other borrowings. The increase in interest expense from deposits resulted from an increase in costs due to deposits repricing in the higher interest rate environment along with growth in higher costing money market and time deposits since the third quarter of 2023. The average cost of deposits, excluding noninterest-bearing deposits, increased by 55 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2023; A 39.7 million decrease in the provision for credit losses, as the Company released provision for credit losses of 7.0) million in the third quarter of 2024 while recording a provision for credit losses of 32.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. During the third quarter of 2024, we released provision for credit losses mainly due to a decline in unfunded commitments leading to a release of provision of (8.7) million. The provision for credit losses also declined due to lower net loan growth in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 as well as improvement in economic forecasts with inflation falling and interest rates beginning to decline in the third quarter of 2024; A 2.1 million increase in noninterest income due to an increase in trust and investment services income of 2.0 million, an increase in bank owned life insurance of 1.2 million, and an increase in fees on deposit accounts of 1.1 million. These increases were offset by a decline in correspondent banking and capital market income of 3.0 million. See Noninterest Income section on page 57 for further discussion; An 8.6 million increase in noninterest expense, which resulted primarily from an increase in salaries and employee benefits of 4.7 million, in merger, branch consolidation, severance related and other expense of 3.1 million, and an information services expense of 1.9 million. These increases were partially offset by declines in FDIC assessment and other regulatory charges of 1.2 million, and amortization of intangibles of 1.3 million. See Noninterest Expense section on page 59 for further discussion; and Higher income tax provision of 10.2 million due to higher pretax book income between the two quarters. The Company recorded pretax book income of 186.5 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to pretax book income of 157.3 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase was also due to the effects of the Company adopting ASU 2023-02 in the first quarter of 2024 whereby it applied the proportional amortization method of accounting related to its low-income housing tax credits partnerships LIHTC ). With the adoption of ASU 2023-02, the amortization of the LIHTCs is now recorded within Provision for Income Taxes rather than Other Noninterest Expense on the Statement of Income. The amortization for the Company s LIHTCs totaled 3.6 million during the third quarter of 2024. The change in the accounting method, in addition to other items recorded during the current quarter, increased our effective tax rate for the third quarter in 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Our effective tax rate was 23.24 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 21.08 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. See Income Tax Expense section on page 60 for further discussion. Our quarterly efficiency ratio increased to 56.6 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 54.0 in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in the efficiency ratio compared to the third quarter of 2023 was the result of a 0.5 decrease in the total of tax-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income along with a 4.3 increase in noninterest expense (excluding amortization of intangibles). This decrease was reflective of a 32.8 increase in interest expense as the repricing of interest-bearing liabilities caught up with the repricing of interest-earning assets in 2023 and 2024 resulting from the rising rate environment. The increase in noninterest expense was reflective of a 3.2 increase in salaries and employee benefits, an 8.6 increase in information services expense, and a 1,914.6 increase in merger and branch consolidation related expense mostly related to the proposed merger with Independent. Basic and diluted EPS were 1.88 and 1.86, respectively, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 1.63 and 1.62, respectively, for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in basic and diluted EPS was due to a 15.3 increase in net income in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The effects from the increase in net income were partially offset by an increase in average basic common shares of 0.2 . The increase in net income in the third quarter of 2024 was mainly attributable to a decrease in provision for credit losses during the third quarter of 2024.

 Denotes a non-GAAP financial measure. The section titled Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP below provides a table that reconciles GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the return on average assets increased compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily due to the increase in net income of 19.0 million, or 15.3 , which was mainly attributable to a decline in the provision for credit losses due to lower new loan growth in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, a decline in unfunded commitments, as well as improvement in economic forecasts with inflation falling and interest rates beginning to decline in the third quarter of 2024. The effects on the return on average assets from the increase in net income were partially offset by an increase in average assets of 1.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from the same period in 2023 mainly due to an increase in average loans of 1.6 billion through organic growth. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the return on average assets declined slightly as average assets increased 1.8 while net income only increased 0.8 compared to the same period in 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the return on average equity increased compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily due to higher net income of 15.3 partially offset by the effects from an increase in average equity of 7.9 . The increase in net income was mainly attributable to lower provision for credit losses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the return on average equity decreased due to a 6.5 increase in average equity or 343.8 million while net income only increased 0.8 or 3.1 million. The increase in average equity was due to net income earned and a reduction in accumulated other comprehensive loss. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the return on average tangible equity increased compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was due to the increase in net income adjusted for amortization of intangibles of 13.8 , or 17.9 million, being greater than the increase in average tangible equity of 13.4 , or 443.5 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the return on average tangible equity decreased due to lower net income adjusted for amortization of intangibles of 333,000, or 0.1 along with an increase in average tangible equity of 369.4 million, or 11.4 . The equity to assets ratios was 12.81 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 1.18 from September 30, 2023. This increase resulted from the effects of the net income earned during the last twelve months being greater than the increase in total assets of 2.4 from September 30, 2023. Dividend payout ratios were 28.76 and 30.82 for the three and nine month periods ending September 30, 2024, respectively, and 31.84 and 29.78 for the three and nine month periods ending September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease in the dividend payout ratio for the three months period ending September 30, 2024, was due to the 15.3 increase in net income being greater than the increase in dividends paid during the current quarter of 4.2 compared to the same period in 2023. The dividend payout ratio for the nine months period ending September 30, 2024, increased due to a net income increase of 0.8 compared to an increase in total dividends paid of 4.3 when compared to the same period in 2023. Net Interest Income and Margin Non-Tax Equivalent TE net interest income decreased 3.9 million, or 1.1 , to 351.5 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 355.4 million in the same period in 2023. Interest-earning assets averaged 41.2 billion during the three months period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 40.4 billion for the same period in 2023, an increase of 847.6 million, or 2.1 . Interest-bearing liabilities averaged 28.1 billion during the three months period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 26.5 billion for the same period in 2023, an increase of 1.5 billion, or 5.7 . Non-TE net interest income decreased 52.7 million, or 4.8 , to 1.0 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.1 billion in the same period in 2023. Interest-earning assets averaged 41.0 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 40.0 billion during the same period in 2023. Interest-bearing liabilities averaged 27.8 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 25.7 billion for the same period in 2023, an increase of 2.0 billion, or 7.9 .

 The Federal Reserve implemented a 50 basis-point rate cut in mid-September 2024, following a series of rate hikes that began in March 2022, resulting in a target range of 4.75 to 5.00 at September 30, 2024. As the rate reduction occurred toward the end of the third quarter of 2024, the Company operated in a comparatively higher rate environment for majority of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, while it operated under a comparatively lower rate environment in the same time periods in 2023. Some key highlights are outlined below: Both the non-TE and TE net interest margin decreased by 10 basis points in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same quarter of 2023 due to the increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities of 56 basis points outweighing the increase in the yield on interest earning assets of 33 basis points. The increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities lagged the increase in yield on interest-earning assets during the rising interest rate cycle prior to the recent rate cut and has caught up in the latter half of 2023 and into 2024 . o Non-TE yield on interest-earning assets for the third quarter of 2024 increased 33 basis points to 5.25 from the comparable period in 2023 due to higher yields on the majority of interest-earning assets, including loans held for investment, investments securities, and loans held for sale, as the Federal Reserve Bank interest rate hikes during 2023 and a majority of the first nine months of 2024 continue to impact these rates. Yields on loans held for sale increased due to new Small Business Administration SBA loan purchases that generally earn higher yields compared to mortgage loans. The interest rate impact, in combination with the increases in the average balance of the higher yielding loan held for investment portfolio of 1.6 billion, and the decline in the average balances of lower yielding investment securities of 550.1 million, affected the overall yield increase between the comparable periods. o The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the third quarter of 2024 increased 56 basis points from the same period in 2023. This increase was driven by the effects from the relatively higher rate environment on the repricing of all deposit accounts, federal funds purchased, securities purchased with agreement to repurchase, and trust preferred corporate debt. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 55 basis points as the cost increase occurred across all deposit categories as a result of the comparatively higher rate environment and a change in the deposit mix. Our deposits have shifted from lower-costing savings and transaction accounts to higher-costing money market accounts as the customers have sought higher yields during the current rate environment. The average balance of transaction deposit accounts decreased by 502.4 million, and savings accounts decreased by 391.4 million, while average balance of money market account increased by 2.1 billion for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The average cost of federal funds purchased and securities sold with agreements to repurchase increased by 92 basis points and 71 basis points, respectively, while the average cost of corporate and subordinated debentures increased by 1 basis point. Other borrowings, consisting of FHLB advances had an average cost of 3.78 during the third quarter of 2024 compared to 5.50 for the compared period in 2023. Our overall cost of funds, including noninterest-bearing deposits, was 1.99 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.52 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 (1) Investment securities (taxable) and (tax-exempt) include trading securities. Investment Securities The interest earned on investment securities decreased by 2.2 million and 7.4 million, respectively, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The average balance of investment securities decreased 550.1 million and 693.5 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, from the comparable periods in 2023. The yield on the investment securities increased 6 basis points and 9 basis points, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023 due to the rising rate environment. While the Bank reduced the size of its investment securities portfolio, the yield on the investment securities increased as the Company reinvested cash flows from securities in a higher interest rates environment in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, resulting in a higher yield in 2024.

 Our non-TE yield on total loans increased 33 basis points in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to a 43 basis-point increase in the yield on the non-acquired loan portfolio and a 2 basis-point increase in the yield on the acquired loan portfolio. o The yield on the acquired loan portfolio increased slightly from 6.15 in the third quarter of 2023 to 6.17 in the same period in 2024, while interest income on the acquired loan portfolio declined by 20.6 million during the same period. The interest income on acquired loans decreased by 20.6 million, due to a 1.3 billion decrease in average balance during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The average balance decreased due to paydowns, pay-offs and renewals of acquired loans that are moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio. The effect from the decline in average acquired loans balance was partially offset by the increase in yield of 2 basis points. o The yield on the non-acquired loan portfolio increased 43 basis points to 5.80 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 5.37 in the same period in 2023. Interest income on the non-acquired loan portfolio increased 68.7 million during the same period. The increases in both yield and interest income on non-acquired loans were attributable to both an increase in the average loan balance of 2.9 billion during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily through organic loan growth and renewals of acquired loans that are moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio, along with a higher yield of 43 basis points due to the higher rate environment . Interest-Bearing Liabilities The quarter-to-date average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased by 1.5 billion, or 5.7 , in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased by 56 basis points to 2.73 and the overall cost of funds, including demand deposits, increased by 47 basis points to 1.99 in the third quarter of 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. Some key highlights for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 include: The cost of interest-bearing deposits was 2.63 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2.08 for the same period in 2023. o Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits increased by 44.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to interest expense on transaction and money market accounts and certificate and other time deposits increased. Interest expense on transaction and money market accounts and certificates and other time deposits increased by 36.1 million and 7.9 million, respectively, while interest expense on savings declined by 26,000. One factor driving the increase in average cost and interest expense was the repricing of deposits in the higher rate environment in 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2023. The increase in the cost of interest-bearing deposits lagged the increase in the yield on interest-earning assets during this higher interest rate cycle and has caught up in the latter half of 2023 and into the first half of 2024. o The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased by 1.3 billion, primarily due to a 1.6 billion average balance increase of transaction and money market accounts and a 75.6 million average balance increase of certificates and other time deposits, which drove up interest expense. The increase in the average balance of transaction and money market accounts was partially offset by a decrease in the average saving deposits of 391.4 million. The cost of federal funds purchased increased 22 basis points while the average balance increased 67.9 million in the third quarter of 2024, which drove the 1.1 million increase in interest expense compared to the same period in 2023. The cost of repurchase agreements was 2.34 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 1.52 for the same period in 2023. The effects from the increase in the cost of repurchase agreements, partially offset by the effects from a decline in the average balance of 45.2 million, drove the increase in the interest expense of 356,000 during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The cost on the corporate and subordinated debt remained flat increasing only by 1 basis point to 6.10 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, while the average balance decreased by 373,000. Interest expense from corporate and subordinated debentures decreased by 7,000 during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to the decrease in average balance.

 The cost of other borrowings, consisting of FHLB advances, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 5.57 and interest expense was 3.1 million compared to 5.50 and 889,000 during the third quarter of 2023. The increase in interest expense was due to an increase in the average balance of other borrowings of 155.4 million to 219.6 million during the third quarter of 2024 compared to 64.1 million during the same period in 2023. The Company used FHLB advances in 2024 to provide additional liquidity as the competition for deposits increased during the year. We continue to monitor and adjust rates paid on deposit products as part of our strategy to manage our net interest margin. Interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits, CDs, other time deposits, federal funds purchased, and other borrowings. Interest-bearing transaction accounts include NOW, HSA, Interest on Lawyers Trust Accounts IOLTA ), and Market Rate checking accounts. Noninterest-Bearing Deposits Noninterest-bearing deposits are transaction accounts that provide our Bank with interest-free sources of funds. Average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased 0.9 billion, or 8.4 , to 10.4 billion in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 11.4 billion during the same period in 2023. The decrease in the average balance of noninterest bearing deposits was due to customers moving funds from noninterest bearing checking accounts to interest bearing checking accounts such as money market and time deposits, seeking higher yields. Noninterest Income Noninterest income provides us with additional revenues that are significant sources of income. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, noninterest income comprised 17.6 , and 17.0 , respectively, of total net interest income and noninterest income. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, noninterest income comprised 17.5 , and 16.8 , respectively, of total net interest income and noninterest income.

This quarterly change in total noninterest income resulted from the following: Service charges on deposit accounts were higher by 1.1 million, or 4.7 , during the current quarter compared to the same period of the prior year. The increase was mainly attributable to a 973,000 increase in overdraft fees in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Trust and investment services income for the third quarter of 2024 increased by 2.0 million, or 21.2 , from the third quarter of 2023, as assets under management have increased by 1.5 billion, or 19.8 . Correspondent banking and capital markets income in the third quarter of 2024 decreased by 3.0 million, or 23.4 , compared to the same quarter in 2023. The decline was primarily related to a decrease of 6.3 million in income generated from the sale of customer swap ARC hedges during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 resulting from the comparatively higher interest rate environment in 2024. The decline was offset by a 4.4 million decrease in the expense attributable to the variation margin payments for centrally cleared swaps where we recorded an expense of 7.5 million related to variation margin payments in the third quarter of 2024 compared to an expense of 11.9 million in the third quarter of 2023. Bank owned life insurance income increased 1.2 million, or 17.6 , during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily due to higher death proceeds on BOLI policies received during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.

 Noninterest income increased by 300,000, or 0.1 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. This year-to-date change in total noninterest income resulted from the following: Service charges on deposit accounts were higher in 2024 by 3.7 million, or 5.7 , compared to 2023. The increase was mainly attributable to a 3.0 million increase in overdraft fees and a 849,000 increase in service charge account maintenance fees in 2024 compared to 2023. Debit, prepaid, ATM and merchant card related income was higher by 1.4 million, or 4.7 , in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase in debit, ATM, prepaid and merchant card related income was primarily due to lower card and ATM system related expense of 1.1 million. Mortgage banking income increased by 4.1 million, or 36.8 , in 2024 compared to 2023, which comprised of a 4.8 million, or 69.2 , increase in secondary market mortgage income and a decrease of 694,000, or 16.4 , in mortgage servicing related income. Mortgage production declined from 1.8 billion in the first nine months of 2023 to 1.5 billion in the first nine months of 2024 with relatively higher mortgage rates continuing during 2024, however we allocated a higher percentage of mortgage production to the secondary market in 2024 compared to 2023 from 38 to 57 . o Mortgage income from the secondary market increased by 4.8 million between the comparable periods resulting from a 3.3 million increase in the gain on sale of mortgage loans, which is net of the commission expense related to mortgage production, a 740,000 increase in the fair value of loans held for sale, the change in fair value of the pipeline of 434,000, and a 337,000 increase in the fair value of MBS forward trades. Mortgage commission expense was 8.7 million in 2024 compared to 6.5 million in 2023. o The decrease in mortgage servicing related income, net of the hedge, in 2024 was due to a 876,000 decrease in the change in fair value of the MSR including decay , offset by a 182,000 increase in service fee income. The decrease in fair value of the MSR between the comparable periods was primarily due to a decrease in the change in fair value from interest rates of 4.8 million and a 179,000 decline in MSR decay, offset by a 4.1 million increase from gains/losses on the MSR hedge. Correspondent banking and capital markets income for 2024 decreased by 26.6 million, or 58.3 , compared to 2023. The decline was primarily related to a decrease of 24.1 million in income generated from the sale of customer swap ARC hedges in 2024 compared to 2023 resulting from the comparatively higher interest rate environment in 2024. The decline was also due to fixed income revenue being lower by 981,000 in 2024 compared to 2023. In addition, the expense attributable to the variation margin payments for centrally cleared swaps increased where we recorded an expense of 29.2 million related to variation margin payments in the 2024 compared to an expense of 28.8 million in 2023. SBA income increased by 2.6 million, or 26.5 in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in gains on sale of SBA loans of 2.1 million due to an increase in the balances of loans sold of 21 in 2024. Other income increased by 9.0 million, or 93.1 , in 2024 compared to 2023. This increase was due to approximately 5.2 million in income recognized on federal tax refunds received during the second quarter of 2024 for net operating loss carrybacks filed in 2021, the Bank recognizing approximately 3.0 million in credits from an external vendor in 2024, and approximately 876,000 resulting from the release of accrued expense attributable to UTPs. Income from VISA merchant sponsorship program, in which the Bank earns fees by aiding merchants in processing transactions through VISA, also increased 651,000.

The quarterly increase in total noninterest expense primarily resulted from the following: Salaries and employee benefits increased 4.7 million, or 3.2 , in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by higher employee benefit costs of 7.0 million, resulting from higher Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans SERP related expense. The lower SERP costs in the third quarter of 2023 was associated with prior year s annual SERP liability adjustment due to increases in interest rates. In addition, salaries increased approximately 1.2 million resulting from merit increases. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in commissions of 2.3 million, which is mainly attributable to lower commissions related to the correspondent banking division resulting from lower bond sales and lower income from the ARC hedging program. Incentive expense also declined by 1.2 million during 2024. Information services expense increased 1.9 million, or 8.6 , in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was due to additional costs associated with the Company updating systems and expenses associated with transferring, managing, and processing data as it grows in size and complexity . Amortization of intangibles, which is related to the Company s prior mergers, decreased 1.3 million, or 19.5 . FDIC assessment and other regulatory charges decreased 1.2 million, or 13.3 , in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily attributed to a lower assessment rate, reflecting the Bank s strengthened capital position year-over-year. Merger, branch consolidation and severance related expense increased 3.1 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Of the 3.1 million increase in 2024, approximately 1.8 million pertains to costs associated with the previously announced acquisition of Independent and 1.3 million in the restructuring costs. Noninterest expense increased by 23.5 million, or 3.3 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The categories and explanations for the fluctuations year-to-date, except the items discussed below, are similar to the ones noted above in the quarterly comparison. Occupancy expense increased 1.3 million, or 2.0 . The increase was primarily due to increases in branch maintenance and repair and lease related expenses. OREO and loan related expense increased to 2.5 million, or 325.9 , in 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to a 1.5 million increase in Special Assets Management SAM related expenses including legal, tax and other costs and a 1.2 million increase in losses from the sales of OREO and other repossessed assets. The Company accrued a total of 4.5 million in 2024 related to the FDIC s special assessment introduced in 2023 to recover losses to the FDIC s Deposit Insurance Fund resulting from the bank failures that occurred in early 2023. The Bank increased its accrual of the FDIC special assessment during the first and second quarter of 2024 based upon estimates of losses provided by the FDIC. Merger, branch consolidation and severance related expense increased by 2.2 million, or 19.5 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to approximately 8.0 million increase in one-time costs associated with the cybersecurity incident, along with approximately 1.8 million increase in merger costs. These increases were offset by a decrease in restructuring costs of 7.7 million.

 Other noninterest expense decreased 2.6 million, or 4.8 in 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease was primarily driven by a 6.3 million reduction due to the amortization of LIHTCs being recorded in income tax expense, effective January 1, 2024, following the adoption of ASU 2023-02, a 2.3 million decrease in donations, a 2.2 million decrease in miscellaneous expense which was mainly related to a release in accrued expense for an uncertain tax position UTP of 2.0 million in the second quarter of 2024, and a 1.9 million decrease in other operational expenses. These decreases were offset by a 10.8 million increase in earnings credit expense to Homeowners Association HOA customers. The Bank provides a credit to HOA customers based on the average deposit balances held that reduces fees for other services provided. Income Tax Expense Our effective tax rate was 23.24 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 21.08 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the effective rate for the quarter, when compared to the same period in the prior year, is driven primarily by amortization of LIHTCs now being recorded as part of income tax expense as a result of the adoption of the proportional amortization under ASU 2023-02 effective January 1, 2024, as well as an increase in pre-tax book income and a decrease in disallowed interest expense. This was partially offset by a decrease in disallowed FDIC premiums and an increase in non-deductible merger expenses recorded during the current period . Our effective tax rate for the first nine months of the year was 23.84 compared to 21.60 for the first nine months of 2023. The increase in the year-to-date effective tax rate compared to the same period of 2023 was primarily driven by amortization of LIHTC investments, an increase in pre-tax book income, a decrease in federal tax credits available in the current period, partially offset by a decrease in disallowed executive compensation and a decrease in disallowed interest expense. In addition, the Company recorded approximately 2.8 million in income tax provision during the first quarter of 2024 related to the revaluation of its deferred income taxes and other tax adjustments. Analysis of Financial Condition Summary Our total assets increased approximately 1.2 billion, or 2.6 , from December 31, 2023, to September 30, 2024, to approximately 46.1 billion. Within total assets, cash and cash equivalents increased by 213.8 million, or 21.4 and net loans increased 1.1 billion, or 3.6 , while investment securities decreased 386.7 million, or 5.2 , during the period. Within total liabilities, deposits grew 589.3 million, or 1.6 , and federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased by 49.1 million, or 10.0 . Total borrowings increased by 199.7 million, or 40.6 . Total shareholder s equity increased 371.5 million, or 6.7 . The increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to the increase in deposits of 589.3 million, and other borrowings of 199.7 million along with the decline in investments of 386.7 million resulting from maturities and pay downs of mortgage-backed securities. The increase in deposits was mainly attributable to an increase in money market accounts and certificate of deposits. The increase in borrowings was due to a net increase in FHLB advances of 200.0 million compared to December 31, 2023. The increases in funding sources were mostly offset by the increase in loans of 1.2 billion, which was due to normal organic growth. Our loan to deposit ratio was 89 and 87 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, while our percentage of noninterest-bearing deposit accounts to total deposits was 28 and 29 , respectively at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023.

 Investment Securities We use investment securities, our second largest category of earning assets, to generate interest income, provide liquidity, fund loan demand or deposit liquidation, and to pledge as collateral for public funds deposits, repurchase agreements, derivative exposures and to augment borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta. At September 30, 2024, investment securities totaled 7.1 billion, compared to 7.5 billion at December 31, 2023, a decrease of 386.7 million, or 5.2 . At September 30, 2024, approximately 64.5 of the investment portfolio was classified as available for sale, approximately 32.5 was classified as held to maturity and approximately 3.0 was classified as other investments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we purchased 140.1 million of capital stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta classified as other investment securities on the balance sheet of which we sold back 130.6 million. The net increase to the capital stock holding for the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta of 9.5 million during the nine months of 2024 was due to the increase in Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Bank purchased 60.7 million of available for sale securities. There were maturities, paydowns, and calls of investment securities totaling 589.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net amortization of premiums was 14.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, the unrealized net losses of the available for sale securities portfolio was 639.8 million, or 12.3 , below its amortized cost basis, compared to an unrealized net loss of 776.6 million, or 14.0 , at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, the unrealized net loss of the held to maturity securities portfolio was 337.6 million, or 14.7 , below its amortized cost basis, compared to an unrealized net loss of 402.7 million, or 16.2 , at December 31, 2023. The following is the combined amortized cost and fair value of investment securities available for sale and held for maturity, aggregated by credit quality indicator:

 Agency mortgage-backed securities MBS ), agency collateralized mortgage-obligations CMO and agency commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS are guaranteed by the issuing government-sponsored enterprise GSE as to the timely payments of principal and interest. Except for Government National Mortgage Association securities, which have the full faith and credit backing of the United States Government, the GSE alone is responsible for making payments on this guaranty. While the rating agencies have not rated any of the MBS, CMO and CMBS issued, senior debt securities issued by GSEs are rated consistently as Triple-A. Most market participants consider agency MBS, CMOs and CMBSs as carrying an implied Aaa rating (S P rating of AA+) because of the guarantees of timely payments and selection criteria of mortgages backing the securities. We do not own any private label mortgage-backed securities. The balances presented under the ratings above reflect the amortized cost of the investment securities. At September 30, 2024 , we had 1,204 investment securities including both available for sale and held to maturity, in an unrealized loss position, which totaled 980.6 million. At December 31, 2023, we had 1,232 investment securities, including both available for sale and held to maturity, in an unrealized loss position, which totaled 1.2 billion. The total number of investment securities with an unrealized loss position decreased, while the total dollar amount of the unrealized loss decreased by 200.6 million. The level of unrealized losses for each period is due to an overall increase in short- and long-term interest rates in 2022 and 2023. The reduction in the unrealized losses in the third quarter of 2024 was due to the Federal Reserve Bank dropping interest rates by 50 basis points during the quarter and the expectation that further rate cuts could come in the fourth quarter of 2024 and into 2025.

 All investment securities in an unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024 , continue to perform as scheduled. We have evaluated the securities and have determined that the decline in fair value, relative to its amortized cost, is not due to credit-related factors. In addition, we have the ability and intent to hold these securities within the portfolio until maturity or until the value recovers, and we believe that it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell these securities prior to recovery. We continue to monitor all of our securities with a high degree of scrutiny. There can be no assurance that we will not conclude in future periods that conditions existing at that time indicate some or all of our securities may be sold or would require a charge to earnings as a provision for credit losses in such periods. Any charges as a provision for credit losses related to investment securities could impact cash flow, tangible capital or liquidity. See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5 Investment Securities for further discussion on the application of ASU 2016-13 on the investment securities portfolio. As securities held for investment are purchased, they are designated as held to maturity or available for sale based upon our intent, which incorporates liquidity needs, interest rate expectations, asset/liability management strategies, and capital requirements. Although securities classified as available for sale may be sold from time to time to meet liquidity or other needs, it is not our normal practice to trade this segment of the investment securities portfolio. From time to time, the Bank may execute transactions to reposition the investment portfolio. Such activity has not expanded the broad asset classes used by the Bank. While management generally holds these assets on a long-term basis or until maturity, any short-term investments or securities available for sale could be converted at an earlier point, depending partly on changes in interest rates and alternative investment opportunities.

Accordingly, when evaluating these securities for impairment, management considers the ultimate recoverability of the par value rather than recognizing temporary declines in value. As of September 30, 2024, we determined that there was no impairment on our other investment securities. As of September 30, 2024, other investment securities represented app rox imately 211.5 million, or 0.46 of total assets, and primarily consists of FHLB and FRB stock which totals 182.6 million, or 0.40 of total assets. There were no gains or losses on the sales of these securities for three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Trading Securities We have a trading portfolio associated with our Correspondent Banking Division and the Bank s subsidiary, SouthState|DuncanWilliams. This portfolio is carried at fair value and realized and unrealized gains and losses are included in trading securities revenue, a component of Correspondent Banking and Capital Markets Income in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Securities purchased for this portfolio have primarily been municipal bonds, treasuries and mortgage-backed agency securities, which are held for short periods of time and totaled 87.1 million and 31.3 million, respectively, at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. Loans Held for Sale The balance of loans held for sale increased 236.2 million from December 31, 2023, to 287.0 million on September 30, 2024. Loans held for sale at September 30, 2024 consisted of mortgage and SBA loans held for sale. At December 31, 2023 loans held for sale consisted only of mortgage loans held for sale. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company began purchasing the guaranteed portions of SBA loans from third-party originators with the intent to aggregate the guaranteed portion of the SBA loans into pools with similar characteristics to create a security representing an interest in those pools through the SBA s fiscal transfer agent. SBA loans held for sale totaled 222.1 million at September 30, 2024. See Note 20 SBA Loans Held for Sale for more information. This new activity in SBA loans held for sale was the main reason for the significant increase in loans held for sale during the current period.

Table of Contents 
 Mortgage loans held for sale totaled 64.9 million at September 30, 2024, an increase from 50.9 million at December 31, 2023. Total mortgage production was 506 million in the third quarter of 2024. This compares to 552 million in the second quarter of 2024 and 521 million in the third quarter of 2023. Mortgage production has remained flat in 2024 as mortgage rates have continued to remain high and housing inventory has remained low. The percentage of mortgage production sold into the secondary market decreased slightly in the third quarter of 2024 to 58 from 59 in the second quarter of 2024 but increased from 47 in the third quarter of 2023. The allocation of mortgage production between portfolio and secondary market depends on the Company s liquidity, market spreads and rate changes during each period and will fluctuate over time. Loans The following table presents a summary of the loan portfolio by category (excludes loans held for sale):

Our non-acquired loan portfolio increased by 2.2 billion, or 11.1 annualized, mainly driven by organic growth. Commercial non-owner-occupied loans, commercial and industrial loans, consumer owner-occupied loans, commercial owner-occupied real estate, and home equity loans led the way with 1.0 billion, 637.0 million, 605.5 million, 270.2 million and 154.6 million in year-to-date loan growth, respectively, or 21.7 , 18.5 , 13.6 , 9.0 and 18.1 annualized growth, respectively. The acquired loan portfolio decreased by 1.0 billion, or 23.4 annualized. This decline in acquired loans was due to paydowns and payoffs in both the PCD and Non-PCD loan categories along with renewals of acquired loans that were moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio. The main categories that declined were commercial non-owner-occupied loans, commercial owner-occupied loans and commercial and industrial loans, which decreased by 362.6 million, 223.2 million and 210.4 million, respectively, year-to-date. Acquired loans as a percentage of total loans decreased to 14.5 and non-acquired loans as a percentage of the overall portfolio increased to 85.5 at September 30, 2024. This compares to acquired loans as a percentage of total loans of 18.2 and non-acquired loans as a percentage of total loans of 81.8 at December 31, 2023.

 Total commercial non-owner-occupied loans of 9.2 billion, approximately 27.6 of the total loans held for investment, was the largest category of the loan portfolio as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 95 of the commercial non-owner-occupied portfolio was located within the Company s footprint. Of the 9.2 billion, approximately 1.3 billion, or 4 of the total loans, represented our office segment. Approximately 95 of the office segment was located in the Company s footprint and approximately 10 was located within the metropolitan or central business district. The weighted average Debt Service Coverage DSC was 1.62x and the loan-to-value was 57 .

Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL) on Loans and Certain Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposures The ACL reflects management s estimate of losses that will result from the inability of our borrowers to make required loan payments. The Company records loans charged off against the ACL and subsequent recoveries, if any, increase the ACL when they are recognized. Please see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, under the ACL Loans section, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further detailed descriptions of our estimation process and methodology related to the ACL on loans. Management considers forward-looking information in estimating expected credit losses. The Company subscribes to a third-party service which provides a quarterly macroeconomic baseline outlook and alternative scenarios for the United States economy. The baseline, along with the evaluation of alternative scenarios, is used by management to determine the best estimate within the range of expected credit losses. Management evaluates the appropriateness of the reasonable and supportable forecast scenarios and takes into consideration the scenarios in relation to actual economic and other data, such as gross domestic product growth, monetary and fiscal policy, inflation, supply chain issues and global events like the Russian/Ukraine conflict and unrest in middle east, as well as the volatility and magnitude of changes within those scenarios quarter over quarter, and consideration of conditions within the Bank s operating environment and geographic area. Additional forecast scenarios may be weighted along with the baseline forecast to arrive at the final reserve estimate. While periods of relative economic stability should generally lead to stability in forecast scenarios and weightings to estimate credit losses, periods of instability can likewise require management to adjust the selection of scenarios and weightings, in accordance with the accounting standards. For the contractual term that extends beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company reverts to the long term mean of historical factors within four quarters using a straight-line approach. The Company generally uses an eight-quarter forecast and a four-quarter reversion period.

 In spite of the rapid interest rate hikes experienced cycle-to-date, the U.S. has thus far avoided a recession, although an inverted yield curve such as observed in the current interest rate environment often portends a coming recession. Management continues to use a blended forecast scenario of the baseline, upside, and more severe scenario, depending on the circumstances and economic outlook. For the quarter ending September 30, 2024, as well as the prior quarter, management selected a baseline weighting of 40 , a 30 weighting for an upside scenario and a 30 weighting for the more severe scenario. The scenario weightings were unchanged from the prior quarter. Scenario weightings are generally expected to remain stable but are reviewed on a quarterly basis. The scenario weightings reflect continued recognition of downside risks in the economic forecast from persistent levels of inflation, high interest rates, and tightening credit conditions conducive of a mild recession. While employment figures still show resilience and actual loan losses remain at low levels, continued projected borrower weakness related to high interest rates, uncertainty, and lingering chances of an economic downturn continue to moderate optimism in the path of the forecast and kept expected losses mostly flat. A decrease in unfunded commitments primarily in commercial construction drove a provision release of approximately 7.0 million during the third quarter of 2024. The Company has a variety of assets that have a component that qualifies as an off-balance sheet exposure. These primarily include undrawn portions of revolving lines of credit and standby letters of credit. Please see MD A, under the Financial Condition , Allowance for Credit Losses ACL section, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further detailed descriptions of our estimation process and methodology related to the ACL on certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures. As of September 30, 2024, the balance of the ACL was 468.0 million or 1.39 of total loans. The ACL decreased 4.3 million from the balance of 472.3 million recorded at June 30, 2024. This decrease during the third quarter of 2024 included 1.8 million in provision for credit losses and 6.1 million in net charge-offs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses based on loan growth and current forecasts applied to our modeling to adequately capture potential economic recessionary risks. As discussed in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the second quarter of 2024, updates were made to certain estimates used in the Company s current expected credit loss model. While the total allowance and coverage of total loans remain the same, reserves at the loan segment level were updated due the expansion of macroeconomic variables. Although portions of the allowance may be allocated to specific loans or pools of loans, the entire allowance is available for any credit that, in management s judgment, should be charged off. At September 30, 2024, the Company had a reserve on unfunded commitments of 41.5 million, which was recorded as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, compared to 50.3 million at June 30, 2024, and 56.3 million at December 31, 2023. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a decrease in the reserve for unfunded commitments of 8.7 million and 14.8 million, respectively. For the prior comparative period, the Company recorded a decrease in the reserve for unfunded commitments of 1.1 million and 4.9 million, respectively, during three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company did not have an allowance for credit losses or record a provision for credit losses on investment securities or other financial asset during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The ACL provides 2.47 times coverage of nonperforming loans at September 30, 2024. Net charge-offs to total average loans during three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, were 0.07 and 0.05 , respectively, compared to net charge-offs to total average loans of 0.16 and 0.08 , respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. We continued to experience solid and stable asset quality numbers and ratios as of September 30, 2024. The following table provides the allocation, by segment, for expected credit losses as of September 30, 2024:

 Total nonperforming assets were 191.0 million, or 0.57 of total loans and repossessed assets, at September 30, 2024, an increase of 6.8 million, or 3.7 , from December 31, 2023. Total nonperforming loans were 189.3 million, or 0.56 , of total loans, at September 30, 2024, an increase of 6.5 million, or 3.6 , from December 31, 2023. Non-acquired nonperforming loans decreased by 3.6 million from December 31, 2023. T he decrease in non-acquired nonperforming loans was driven primarily by a decrease in commercial nonaccrual loans of 22.2 million, a decrease in accruing loans past due 90 days or more of 4.4 million, offset by an increase in consumer nonaccrual loans of 13.2 million and restructured nonaccrual loans of 9.8 million. The accruing loans past due 90 days or more decreased by 4.4 million at September 30, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023, due primarily to a decrease in accruing loans past due 90 days or more of factored receivables, which are trade credits rather than promissory notes loans that are deemed to be low risk . The increase in restructured nonaccrual loans of 9.8 million was primarily due to two commercial loans that were modified under a term extension agreement. Acquired nonperforming loans increased 10.2 million from December 31, 2023. The increase in the acquired nonperforming loan balances was due primarily to an increase in commercial nonaccrual loans of 4.7 million, an increase in restructured nonaccrual loans of 5.7 million, an increase in consumer nonaccrual loans of 600,000, offset by a decline in accruing loans past due 90 days or more of 800,000. As discussed previously under the Loans section in this MD A, commercial non-owner-occupied loans represented the largest category of the loan portfolio as of September 30, 2024. We continued to experience solid and stable asset quality for these loans as of September 30, 2024, as approximately 0.2 of the total commercial non-owner-occupied loans were on non-accrual. In addition, approximately 5.1 and 2.6 of the total commercial non-owner-occupied loans were classified as substandard and still accruing, and special mention, respectively. The majority of these classified assets are mainly related to debt service coverage policy violations as interest rates have risen. However, most of these loans are still performing, are strongly collateralized and have strong borrowers supporting the loans. For additional information on the Company s monitoring process for classified loans and a description of the general characteristics of the risk grades, refer to Note 6 Loans in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Interest-Bearing Liabilities Interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits, CDs, other time deposits, federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings. Interest-bearing transaction accounts include NOW, HSA, Interest on Layers Trust Accounts IOLTA ), and Market Rate checking accounts. Total interest-bearing deposits increased 862.0 million, or 4.4 annualized, to 27.3 billion at September 30, 2024, from 26.4 billion at December 31, 2023. This increase mainly driven by growth in money market accounts of 1.1 billion, including 174.3 million in reciprocal insured money market deposits and time deposits of 404.7 million. This increase was partially offset by declines in interest-bearing checking accounts of 428.4 million and savings deposits of 189.6 million. Customers continue to move funds from lower yielding deposit products seeking higher yields in money market accounts and time deposits. Federal funds purchased related to the Correspondent Banking Division and securities sold under agreements to repurchase were 538.3 million at September 30, 2024, a 49.1 million increase from December 31, 2023. Other borrowings, consisting of FHLB borrowings, increased to 300.0 million at September 30, 2024 from 100.0 million at December 31, 2023. Corporate and subordinated debentures declined by 278,000 to 391.7 million. Some key highlights are outlined below: 
 As noted above, the Company s higher costing money market accounts and time deposits increased during the first nine months of 2024. The Company raised interest rates on most interest-bearing deposit products (in particular money market accounts and time deposit specials) due to competitive pressures to retain deposits. Average interest-bearing deposits increased by 1.3 billion to 26.9 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. For more information on the composition of our total deposits, see Note 9 Deposits. Other borrowings, consisting of FHLB borrowings, increased 200.0 million to 300.0 million at September 30, 2024, from 100.0 million at December 31, 2023. The Company borrowed additional FHLB borrowings in the first nine months of 2024 to provide additional liquidity. Noninterest-Bearing Deposits Noninterest-bearing deposits are transaction accounts that provide our Bank with interest-free sources of funds. At September 30, 2024, the period end balance of noninterest-bearing deposits of 10.4 billion declined slightly compared to the balance at December 31, 2023 of 10.6 billion. Average noninterest-bearing deposits were 10.4 billion for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 11.4 billion for the third quarter of 2023. This decrease in the average noninterest bearing deposits from the quarter ended September 30, 2023, was mainly due to customers seeking higher yields in the comparatively higher rate environment. Also, customers have less excess cash as funds from government support programs related to the COVID-19 pandemic have declined, as well as the resulting effects of higher costs related to inflation.

 Uninsured Deposits At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately 13.9 billion and 14.2 billion, respectively, in estimated uninsured deposits. The amounts above are estimates and are based on the same methodologies and assumptions used for the Bank s regulatory reporting requirements issued by the FDIC for the FFIEC 041, also referred to as the Call Report. Capital Resources Our ongoing capital requirements have been met primarily through retained earnings, less the payment of cash dividends. As of September 30, 2024, shareholders equity was 5.9 billion, an increase of 371.5 million, or 6.7 , from December 31, 2023. The following table shows the changes in shareholders equity during 2024: 

(Dollars in thousands) Total shareholders' equity at December 31, 2023 5,533,098 Net income 390,605 Cumulative adjustment pursuant to adoption of ASU 2023-02 (10,246) Dividends paid on common shares 1.58 per share) (120,391) Dividends paid on restricted stock units (1,260) Net increase in market value of securities available for sale, net of deferred taxes 102,896 Stock options exercised 3,993 Employee stock purchases 1,484 Equity based compensation 20,898 Common stock repurchased pursuant to stock repurchase plan (7,985) Common stock repurchased - equity plans (8,698) Stock issued in lieu of cash - directors fees 186 Total shareholders' equity at September 30, 2024 5,904,580 The Company did not repurchase any shares under the 2022 Stock Repurchase Plan in the third or second quarter of 2024. The Company repurchased 100,000 shares, at an average price of 79.85 per share for a total of 8.0 million under the 2022 Stock Repurchase Plan during the first quarter of 2024. The number of shares to be purchased and the timing of the purchases are based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the level of cash balances, general business conditions, regulatory requirements, the market price of our common stock, and the availability of alternative investment opportunities. As of September 30, 2024, a total of 3,920,021 authorized shares remains available for repurchase. Under current regulations, the Company and the Bank are subject to a minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital CET1 to risk-weighted assets of 4.5 and a minimum required ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6 . The minimum required leverage ratio is 4 . The minimum required total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio is 8 . Refer to Note 17 Capital Ratios for more information regarding Company and Bank s regulatory capital compliance requirements. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule for additional transitional relief to regulatory capital related to the impact of the adoption of CECL. The Company chose the five-year transition method and is deferring the recognition of the effects from the adoption date and the CECL difference for the first two years of application. The modified CECL transitional amount was fixed as of December 31, 2021, and that amount began the three-year phase out in the first quarter of 2022 with 25 phased out in 2024. At September 30, 2024, approximately 15.3 million was added to Tier 1 capital at the Company and Bank as a result of the modified CECL transition. Had the Company elected not to apply the modified CECL transitional amount to its Tier 1 capital, the Company and Bank would have still been considered well capitalized as of September 30, 2024 .

 The well-capitalized minimums and the Company s and the Bank s regulatory capital ratios for the following periods are reflected below: 

Well-Capitalized September 30, December 31, Minimums 2024 2023 SouthState Corporation: Common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital N/A 12.37 11.75 Tier 1 risk-based capital 6.00 12.37 11.75 Total risk-based capital 10.00 14.72 14.08 Tier 1 leverage N/A 9.98 9.42 SouthState Bank: Common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital 6.50 13.15 12.52 Tier 1 risk-based capital 8.00 13.15 12.52 Total risk-based capital 10.00 14.41 13.75 Tier 1 leverage 5.00 10.59 10.03 The Company s and Bank s Common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital and Tier 1 leverage ratios all improved compared to December 31, 2023. All of these ratios mainly improved due to net income recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 390.6 million. Tier 1 capital increased by 6.5 and 6.3 at both the Company and Bank, respectively, with the increase in equity from the net income recognized. Total risk-based capital increased by 5.8 and 6.1 at both the Company and Bank, respectively, with the increase in equity resulting from net income along with the increase in the allowance for credit losses and unfunded commitments includable in Tier 2 capital. Both regulatory risk-based assets and quarterly average assets remained reasonably flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 with average assets for both the Company and Bank increasing by 0.6 and risk-based assets increasing by 1.2 . Our capital ratios are currently well in excess of the minimum standards and continue to be in the well capitalized regulatory classification. Liquidity Liquidity refers to our ability to generate sufficient cash to meet our financial obligations, which arise primarily from the withdrawal of deposits, extension of credit and payment of operating expenses. Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank s financial condition or overall safety and soundness is adversely affected by an inability (or perceived inability) to meet its obligations. Our Asset Liability Management Committee ALCO is charged with the responsibility of monitoring policies designed to ensure acceptable composition of our asset/liability mix. Two critical areas of focus for ALCO are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management. We have employed our funds in a manner to provide liquidity from both assets and liabilities sufficient to meet our cash needs. The ALCO has established key risk indicators to monitor liquidity and interest rate risk. The key risk indicators are reviewed and approved by the ALCO on an annual basis. The liquidity key risk indicators include the loan to deposit ratio, net noncore funding dependence ratio, On-hand liquidity to total liabilities ratio, the percentage of securities pledged to total securities, and the ratio of brokered deposits to total deposits. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was operating within its liquidity policy limits. Asset liquidity is maintained by the maturity structure of loans, investment securities and other short-term investments. Management has policies and procedures governing the length of time to maturity on loans and investments. Normally, changes in the earning asset mix are of a longer-term nature and are not used for day-to-day corporate liquidity needs. Our liabilities provide liquidity on a day-to-day basis. Daily liquidity needs are met from deposit levels or from our use of federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, interest-bearing deposits at other banks and other short-term borrowings. We engage in routine activities to retain deposits intended to enhance our liquidity position. These routine activities include various measures, such as the following: Emphasizing relationship banking to new and existing customers, where borrowers are encouraged and normally expected to maintain deposit accounts with our Bank; Pricing deposits, including certificates of deposit, at rate levels that will attract and /or retain balances of deposits that will enhance our Bank s asset/liability management and net interest margin requirements; and Continually working to identify and introduce new products that will attract customers or enhance our Bank s appeal as a primary provider of financial services.

 Overall, total loans increased 1.2 billion, or 4.8 annualized in first nine months of 2024. Our non-acquired loan portfolio increased by approximately 2.2 billion, or approximately 11.1 annualized, compared to the balance at December 31, 2023. The increase from December 31, 2023 was mainly related to organic growth and renewals on acquired loans that are moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio. The acquired loan portfolio decreased by 1.0 billion from the balance on December 31, 2023, through principal paydowns, charge-offs, foreclosures and renewals of acquired loans. Our investment securities portfolio (excluding trading securities) decreased by approximately 386.7 million compared to the balance at December 31, 2023. The decrease in investment securities from December 31, 2023, was a result of maturities, calls, sales and paydowns of investment securities totaling 719.7 million and a reduction from the net amortization of premiums of 14.6 million. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the market value of the available for sale investment securities portfolio of 136.8 million and purchases of investment securities of 200.8 million. Purchases of available for sale investment securities and other investment securities totaled 60.7 million and 140.2 million, respectively. There were no purchases of held to maturity securities during 2024. The purchases of other investment securities were related to capital stock with the Federal Home Loan Bank of which we sold back 130.6 million during 2024. The activity in the purchases and sales of the Federal Home Loan Bank Capital Stock was due to activity with FHLB borrowings during the year. The Bank pledges a portion of its investment portfolio for a variety of purposes, including, but not limited to, collateral for public funds and credit with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta. As of September 30, 2024, the bank pledged 41.5 of the market value of its available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investment portfolios. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank had unpledged securities with a market value of 3.8 billion. These securities included Treasury, Agency, Agency MBS, Municipals and Corporate securities . Total cash and cash equivalents were 1.2 billion at September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.0 billion at December 31, 2023. Liquidity tightened starting in 2023 with the rising rate environment and turmoil in the financial markets occurring in early 2023. Competition for in-market deposits has increased throughout 2023 and 2024 resulting in increases in deposit rates to retain local deposits. The Bank supplements its in-market deposits with brokered deposits. While the Bank has a policy limit for brokered time deposits of no more than 15 of total deposits, it has operated well below this policy limit. At September 30, 2024, the percentage of brokered time deposits to total deposits was 2.8 compared to 1.9 at December 31, 2023. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company also borrowed funds from the FHLB on a short-term basis of 300.0 million. The outstanding borrowings from the FHLB were 100.0 million at December 31, 2023. See below for further discussion around brokered deposits and FHLB borrowings. Our ongoing philosophy is to remain in a liquid position, as reflected by such indicators as the composition of our earning assets, typically including some level of reverse repurchase agreements; federal funds sold; balances at the Federal Reserve Bank; and/or other short-term investments; asset quality; well-capitalized position; and profitable operating results. Cyclical and other economic trends and conditions can disrupt our desired liquidity position at any time. We expect that these conditions would generally be of a short-term nature. Under such circumstances, we expect our reverse repurchase agreements and federal funds sold positions, or balances at the Federal Reserve Bank, if any, to serve as the primary source of immediate liquidity. We could draw on additional alternative immediate funding sources from lines of credit extended to us from our correspondent banks. The Bank may also access funds from borrowing facilities established with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta and the discount window of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta . Deposit flows are significantly influenced by general and local economic conditions, changes in prevailing interest rates, internal pricing decisions and competition. Our deposits are primarily obtained from depositors located around our branch footprint, and we believe that we have attractive opportunities to capture additional retail and commercial deposits in our markets, in addition to having access to brokered deposits. Of the 37.6 billion in total deposits at September 30, 2024, approximately 69 were insured or collateralized. The Bank has a granular deposit base comprised of over 1.4 million accounts, with an average deposit size of 27,000. The top ten and twenty deposit relationships comprise approximately 2 and 4 of total deposits, respectively, and approximately 28 of total deposits are non-interest bearing. At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we had 1.1 billion and 719.7 million of traditional, out of market brokered time deposits, respectively . At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we had 2.4 billion and 2.2 billion, respectively, of reciprocal deposits . Total deposits were 37.6 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of 589.3 million from 37.0 billion at December 31, 2023 . This change in deposits from December 31, 2023, was driven by an increase in money market accounts of 1.1 billion, including 174.3 million in reciprocal insured money market deposits and in time deposits of 404.7 million. This increase was partially offset by declines in interest-bearing checking accounts of 428.4 million and savings deposits of 189.6 million. As customers moved funds from noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing checking and savings accounts, seeking higher yields in the rising rate environment, the Company has seen an increase in its balance of higher yielding money market accounts and time deposits during 2024. The Company raised interest rates on most interest-bearing deposit products (in particular money market accounts and time deposit specials) due to competitive pressures to retain deposits.

 Total short-term borrowings at September 30, 2024, were 538.3 million, consisting of 290.4 million in federal funds purchased and 247.9 million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase. The Company also held 300.0 million in short term daily rate FHLB advances at September 30, 2024. Total long-term borrowing at September 30, 2024, were 391.6 million and consisted of trust preferred securities and subordinated debentures. To the extent that we employ other types of non-deposit funding sources, typically to accommodate retail and correspondent customers, we continue to take in shorter maturities of such funds. Our current approach may provide an opportunity to sustain a low funding rate or possibly lower our cost of funds but could also increase our cost of funds if interest rates rise . In addition to deposits, we have other primary contingency funding sources available to the Bank. At September 30, 2024, our Bank had a total FHLB credit facility of 6.5 billion, with 300.0 million in FHLB advance outstanding and 2.9 million in FHLB letters of credit outstanding at quarter-end, leaving 6.2 billion in availability on the FHLB credit facility. In addition, our Bank had 1.7 billion of credit available at the Federal Reserve Bank s discount window and had 2.9 billion in market value of unpledged securities at September 30, 2024, that can be pledged to obtain additional funds, if necessary. All of these resources provide 12.0 billion of additional funding for the Bank. As discussed previously and presented below, the table below compares Primary Funding Sources to uninsured deposits as of September 30, 2024. 

(Dollars in millions) Available Capacity Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta 6,167 Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta Discount Window 1,720 Cash and cash equivalents 1,213 Fair value of securities that can be pledged 2,895 Total primary sources 11,995 Uninsured deposits, excluding collateralized deposits 11,748 Uninsured and collateralized deposits 13,856 Coverage ratio, uninsured deposits 102.1 Coverage ratio, uninsured and collateralized deposits 86.6 Ratio of uninsured and collateralized deposits to total deposits 36.8 The Bank also has an internal limit on brokered deposits of 15 of total deposits which would allow capacity of 5.6 billion as of September 30, 2024. The Bank had 1.1 billion of outstanding brokered deposits at the end of the quarter leaving 4.6 billion in available capacity. The Bank has federal funds credit lines of 275.0 million with no balances outstanding at quarter-end and the holding company has a 100.0 million unsecured line of credit with U.S. Bank National Association with no balance outstanding at September 30, 2024. We believe that our liquidity position continues to be adequate and readily available. In addition to adequate liquidity, the Company and Bank are considered well capitalized by all regulatory capital standards as the Company and the Bank were significantly above the required capital levels as of September 30, 2024. The Company s tier 1 leverage ratio, CET 1 risk-based capital ratio and total risk-based capital ratio were 9.98 , 12.49 and 14.85 , respectively, at September 30, 2024. The Bank s Tier 1 leverage ratio, CET 1 risk-based capital ratio and total risk-based capital ratio were 10.59 , 13.27 and 14.54 , respectively, at September 30, 2024. As permitted, we elected to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income related to available for sale securities from Tier 1, CET 1 and total risk-based capital; however, even if our unrealized losses as of September 30, 2024 in our available for sale and held to maturity investment portfolios were recognized by selling the portfolios for liquidity purposes, all else being equal, our regulatory capital ratios would remain well in excess of the minimum standards and continue to be in the well capitalized regulatory classification. Asset-Liability Management and Market Risk Sensitivity Our earnings and the economic value of equity vary in relation to the behavior of interest rates and the accompanying fluctuations in market prices of certain of our financial instruments. We define interest rate risk as the risk to earnings and equity arising from the behavior of interest rates. These behaviors include increases and decreases in interest rates as well as continuation of the current interest rate environment.

Table of Contents 
 Our interest rate risk principally consists of reprice, option, basis, and yield curve risk. Reprice risk results from differences in the maturity or repricing characteristics of asset and liability portfolios. Option risk arises from embedded options in the investment and loan portfolios such as investment securities calls and loan prepayment options. Option risk also exists since deposit customers may withdraw funds at their discretion in response to general market conditions, competitive alternatives to existing accounts or other factors. The exercise of such options may result in higher costs or lower revenue. Basis risk refers to the potential for changes in the underlying relationship between market rates or indices, which subsequently result in narrowing spreads on interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Basis risk also exists in administered rate liabilities, such as interest-bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, and money market accounts where the price sensitivity of such products may vary relative to general markets rates. Yield curve risk refers to adverse consequences of nonparallel shifts in the yield curves of various market indices that impact our assets and liabilities. We use simulation analysis as a primary method to assess earnings at risk and equity at risk due to assumed changes in interest rates. Management uses the results of its various simulation analyses in combination with other data and observations to formulate strategies designed to maintain interest rate risk within risk tolerances. Simulation analysis involves the use of several assumptions including, but not limited to, the timing of cash flows such as the terms of contractual agreements, investment security calls, loan prepayment speeds, deposit attrition rates, the interest rate sensitivity of loans and deposits relative to general market rates, and the behavior of interest rates and spreads. The assumptions for loan prepayments, deposit decay, and nonstable deposit balances are derived from models that use historical bank data. These models are independently validated. Equity at risk simulation uses assumptions regarding discount rates that value cash flows. Simulation analysis is highly dependent on model assumptions that may vary from actual outcomes. Key simulation assumptions are subject to sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of assumption changes on earnings at risk and equity at risk. Model assumptions are reviewed by our Assumptions Committee. While the Bank is continuously refining its modeling methodology, the core principles of the methodology have remained stable over for several years. Earnings at risk is defined as the percentage change in net interest income due to assumed changes in interest rates. Earnings at risk is generally used to assess interest rate risk over relatively short time horizons. Equity at risk is defined as the percentage change in the net economic value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates compared to a base net economic value. The discounted present value of all cash flows represents our economic value of equity. Equity at risk is generally considered a measure of the long-term interest rate exposures of the balance sheet at a point in time. The earnings simulation models consider our contractual agreements with regard to investments, loans, deposits, borrowings, and derivatives as well as a number of behavioral assumptions applied to certain assets and liabilities. Mortgage banking derivatives used in the ordinary course of business consist of forward sales contracts and interest rate lock commitments on residential mortgage loans. These derivatives involve underlying items, such as interest rates, and are designed to mitigate risk. Derivatives are also used to hedge mortgage servicing rights. For additional information see Note 16 Derivative Financial Instruments in the consolidated financial statements. From time to time, we execute interest rate swaps to hedge some of our interest rate risks. Under these arrangements, the Company enters into a variable rate loan with a client in addition to a swap agreement. The swap agreement effectively converts the client s variable rate loan into a fixed rate loan. The Company then enters into a matching swap agreement with a third-party dealer to offset its exposure on the customer swap. The Company may also execute interest rate swap agreements that are not specific to client loans. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a series of short-term interest rate hedges to address monthly accrual mismatches related to the Company s ARC program and its transition from LIBOR to SOFR after June 30, 2023. For additional information on these derivatives refer to Note 16 Derivative Financial Instruments in the consolidated financial statements. Our interest rate risk key indicators are applied to a static balance sheet using forward rates from the Moody s Baseline Scenario. The Company will also use other rate forecasts, including, but not limited to, Moody s Consensus Scenario. This Base Case Scenario assumes the maturity composition of asset and liability rollover volumes is modeled to approximately replicate current consolidated balance sheet characteristics throughout the simulation. These treatments are consistent with the Company s goal of assessing current interest rate risk embedded in its current balance sheet. The Base Case Scenario assumes that maturing or repricing assets and liabilities are replaced at prices referencing forward rates derived from the selected rate forecast consistent with current balance sheet pricing characteristics. Key rate drivers are used to price assets and liabilities with sensitivity assumptions used to price non-maturity deposits. The sensitivity assumptions for the pricing of non-maturity deposits are subjected to sensitivity analysis no less frequently than on an annual basis.

 Interest rate shocks are applied to the Base Case on an instantaneous basis. Our policy establishes the use of upward and downward interest rate shocks applied in 100 basis point increments through 400 basis points. We calculate smaller rate shocks as needed. At times, market conditions may result in assumed rate movements that will be deemphasized. For example, during a period of ultra-low interest rates, certain downward rate shocks may be impractical. The model simulation results produced from the Base Case Scenario and related instantaneous shocks for changes in net interest income and changes in the economic value of equity are referred to as the Core Scenario Analysis and constitute the policy key risk indicators for interest rate risk when compared to risk tolerances. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was operating within its interest rate key risk indicator policy limits. During 2023 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the beta assumption applied to total deposits increased to reflect changes in deposit mix. From the beginning of the upward rate cycle, our deposit costs have increased from five basis points to one hundred and ninety basis points. During this period, the federal funds rate has increased 525 basis points. Accordingly, our cycle to date beta has been approximately 36 . Management recognizes the difficulty in using historical data to forecast deposit betas in the current environment. For internal purposes, and based on the deposit mix as of September 30, 2024, the total deposit beta assumption was 36.7 . For internal forecasting, management will apply overlays to certain assumptions to adjust for current market conditions rather than use assumptions modeled over longer periods of time. The following interest rate risk metrics are derived from analysis using the Moody s Baseline Scenario published in October 2024 as the Base Case Scenario. As of September 30, 2024, the earnings simulations indicated that the year 1 impact of an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase / decrease in rates would result in an estimated 1.2 increase (up 100) and 1.9 decrease (down 100) in net interest income. We use Economic Value of Equity EVE analysis as an indicator of the extent to which the present value of our capital could change, given potential changes in interest rates. This measure also assumes a static balance sheet (Base Case Scenario) with rate shocks applied as described above. At September 30, 2024, the percentage change in EVE due to a 100-basis point increase or decrease in interest rates was 2.1 decrease and 1.2 increase, respectively. The percentage changes in EVE due to a 200-basis point increase or decrease in interest rates were 5.1 decrease and 0.7 decrease, respectively. Downward shocks are constrained on various balance sheet categories due to the inability to price products below floors or zero. This is particularly meaningful given the cost of deposits as of September 30, 2024. The analysis below reflects a Base Case and shocked scenarios that assume a static balance sheet projection where volume is added to maintain balances consistent with current levels. Base Case assumes new and repricing volumes reference forward rates derived from the Moody s Baseline rate forecast. Instantaneous, parallel, and sustained interest rate shocks are applied to the Base Case scenario over a one-year time horizon. 

Percentage Change in Net Interest Income over One Year Up 100 basis points 1.2 Down 100 basis points (1.9) Down 200 basis points (5.3) Down 300 basis points (9.8) Down 400 basis points (12.8) Deposit Concentrations As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we have no material concentration of deposits from any single customer or group of customers. We have no significant portion of our deposits concentrated within a single industry or group of related industries. We do not believe there are any material seasonal factors that would have a material adverse effect on us. The total deposit balances held by top ten and 20 deposit holders were below 5 of the Company s average total deposit balances at September 30, 2024. We do not have any foreign deposits.

 Concentration of Credit Risk Each category of earning assets has a certain degree of credit risk. We use various techniques to measure credit risk. Credit risk in the investment portfolio can be measured through bond ratings published by independent agencies. In the investment securities portfolio, the investments consist of U.S. government-sponsored entity securities, tax-free securities, or other securities having ratings of AAA to Not Rated . All securities, with the exception of those that are not rated, were rated by at least one of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations. The credit risk of the loan portfolio can be measured by historical experience. We maintain our loan portfolio in accordance with credit policies that we have established. Although the Bank has a diversified loan portfolio, a substantial portion of our borrowers abilities to honor their contracts is dependent upon economic conditions within our geographic footprint and the surrounding regions. We consider concentrations of credit to exist when, pursuant to regulatory guidelines, the amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar business activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by general economic conditions represents 25 of total Tier 1 capital plus regulatory adjusted allowance for credit losses of the Company, or 1.2 billion at September 30, 2024. Based on this criteria, we had seven such credit concentrations at September 30, 2024, including loans to lessors of nonresidential buildings (except mini-warehouses) of 5.7 billion, loans secured by owner-occupied office buildings (including medical office buildings) of 1.9 billion, loans secured by owner-occupied nonresidential buildings (excluding office buildings) of 1.8 billion, loans to lessors of residential buildings (investment properties and multi-family) of 2.8 billion, loans secured by 1st mortgage 1-4 family owner-occupied residential property (including condos and home equity lines) of 9.5 billion, loans secured by jumbo (original loans greater than 548,250) of 2.7 billion, and loans secured by business assets including accounts receivable, inventory and equipment of 2.9 billion. The risk for these loans and for all loans is managed collectively through the use of credit underwriting practices developed and updated over time. The loss estimate for these loans is determined using our standard ACL methodology. After the adoption of CECL in the first quarter of 2020, banking regulators established guidelines for calculating credit concentrations. Banking regulators set the guidelines for construction, land development and other land loans to total less than 100 of total Tier 1 capital less modified CECL transitional amount plus ACL (CDL concentration ratio) and for total commercial real estate loans (construction, land development and other land loans along with other non-owner-occupied commercial real estate and multifamily loans) to total less than 300 of total Tier 1 capital less modified CECL transitional amount plus ACL (CRE concentration ratio). Both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by the Bank s total Tier 1 capital less modified CECL transitional amount plus ACL. At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Bank s CDL concentration ratio was 47.4 and 59.7 , respectively, and its CRE concentration ratio was 227.1 and 236.5 , respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank was below the established regulatory guidelines. When a bank s ratios are in excess of one or both of these loan concentration ratios guidelines, banking regulators generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by bank management. Therefore, we monitor these two ratios as part of our concentration management processes.

 R econciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP The return on average tangible equity is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the effect of the average balance of intangible assets and adds back the after-tax amortization of intangibles to GAAP basis net income. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional information that is useful to investors in evaluating our performance and capital and may facilitate comparisons with other institutions in the banking industry as well as period-to-period comparisons. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of performance or financial condition as promulgated under GAAP, and investors should consider the Company s performance and financial condition as reported under GAAP and all other relevant information when assessing the performance or financial condition of the Company. Non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, are not audited, and may not be comparable to other similarly titled financial measures used by other companies. Investors should not consider non-GAAP measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company s results or financial condition as reported under GAAP.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK There have been no material changes in our quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of September 30, 2024, from those disclosures presented in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended 2023. Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures SouthState s management, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of SouthState s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 , in accordance with Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We applied our judgment in the process of reviewing these controls and procedures, which, by their nature, can provide only reasonable assurance regarding our control objectives. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that SouthState s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, were effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding our control objectives. The design of any system of controls and procedures is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. There can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS On February 9, 2024, the Company disclosed that it detected what was determined to be a cybersecurity incident on February 6, 2024 (the Cyber Incident ). The Bank notified banking regulators and law enforcement and, based on its investigation and findings, notified individuals whose personal information may have been compromised in the Cyber Incident. Further, the Bank has taken other actions, such as offering credit monitoring services. While the Company is unable to estimate the total cost of any remediation that may be required, as of September 30, 2024, the Company has not incurred material litigation costs as a result of the Cyber Incident. On April 3, 2024, a putative class action lawsuit (the Original Suit was filed against the Bank purportedly on behalf of a class consisting of those persons impacted by the Cyber Incident. While the Original Suit was voluntarily dismissed, as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, one putative class action lawsuit is pending. For more information about the Original Suit and other litigations filed in connection with the Cyber Incident, please refer to Note 13 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Other than the Cyber Incident Suit (as defined in Note 13 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities), as of September 30, 2024, and the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we believe that we are not party to, nor is any of our property the subject of, any pending material legal proceeding other than those that may occur in the ordinary course of our business. Item 1A. RISK FACTORS Investing in shares of our common stock involves certain risks, including those identified and described in Item 1A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as well as cautionary statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including those under the caption Cautionary Note Regarding Any Forward-Looking Statements set forth in Part I, Item 2. of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, risks and matters described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our other filings with the SEC. The Company is providing this additional risk factor to supplement the risk factors contained in Item 1A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. We may face risks with respect to future expansion, including our proposed acquisition of Independent. Our business growth, profitability and market share have been enhanced by us engaging in strategic mergers and acquisitions and de novo branching either within or contiguous to our existing footprint. We have entered into a Merger Agreement with Independent, and we may acquire other financial institutions or parts of those institutions in the future and engage in additional de novo branching. We may also consider and enter into or acquire new lines of business or offer new products or services. As part of our acquisition strategy, we seek companies that are culturally similar to us, have experienced management and are in markets in which we operate or close to those markets so we can achieve economies of scale. We also may receive future inquiries and have discussions with potential acquirers of us or potential companies in which we may engage in a so-called merger of equals. Acquisitions and mergers, including our proposed acquisition of Independent, involve a number of risks, including: the time and costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and merger partners; inaccurate estimates and judgments regarding credit, operations, management and market risks of the target institution; the time and costs of evaluating new markets, hiring experienced local management and opening new offices, and the time lags between these activities and the generation of sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion; our ability to receive regulatory approvals on the timeline and terms that are acceptable to us; the adverse consequences (including applicable termination fees and negative reactions from the financial markets and our customers and employees) we may experience if a merger is terminated under certain circumstances; the business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while a merger is pending; the limitation on our ability to pursue alternative acquisitions and mergers and the hinderance of other companies interest in trying to acquire us; our potential inability to satisfy certain conditions to the merger; our ability to finance an acquisition and possible dilution to our existing shareholders; 

 80 

Table of Contents 
 potential deposit attrition, higher than expected costs, customer loss and business disruption associated with merger and acquisition integration, including, without limitation, and potential difficulties in maintaining relationships with key personnel; our ability to manage the expanded business and operations post-merger; the diversion of our management s attention to the negotiation of a transaction, and the integration of the operations and personnel of the combining businesses; entry into new markets where we lack experience; the strain of growth on our infrastructure, staff, internal controls and management, which may require additional personnel, time and expenditures; exposure to potential asset quality issues with acquired institutions; the introduction of new products and services into our business; the possibility of unknown or contingent liabilities; the incurrence and possible impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and possible adverse short-term effects on our results of operations; the risk of loss of key employees and customers; and fluctuations in the market price of SouthState common stock pre- and post-merger. 
 We also face litigation risks with respect to potential mergers and acquisitions, and such litigation is common. We expect to continue to evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities that are presented to us in our current and expected markets and conduct due diligence related to those opportunities, as well as negotiate to acquire or merge with other institutions. If we announce a transaction, we may issue equity securities, including common stock and securities convertible into shares of our common stock in connection with future acquisitions. As a result, holders of our common stock may have a reduced ownership and voting interest in the Company after a transaction and may exercise less influence over management. We also may issue debt to finance one or more transactions, including subordinated debt issuances. Generally, acquisitions of financial institution involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, resulting in dilution of our book value and fully diluted earnings per share, as well as dilution to our existing shareholders. We may incur substantial costs to expand, and we can give no assurance such expansion will result in the levels of profits we seek. There is no assurance that, following any future mergers or acquisitions, including our proposed acquisition of Independent, that our integration efforts will be successful or our Company, after giving effect to the acquisition, will achieve increased revenues comparable to or better than our historical experience, and failure to realize such expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in market presence or other benefits could have a material adverse effect on our financial conditions and results of operations. We may not be able to successfully integrate Independent or to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger with Independent. We entered into a Merger Agreement with Independent on May 17, 2024. If the proposed acquisition of Independent is completed, we will also integrate the systems and operations of Independent. A successful integration of Independent s operations with our operations so that the Company operates as one entity depends substantially on our ability to successfully consolidate operations, management teams, corporate cultures, systems and procedures and to eliminate redundancies and costs. While we have substantial experience in successfully integrating institutions we have acquired, we may encounter difficulties during integration, such as: the loss of key employees and customers; the disruption of operations and businesses; inability to maintain and increase competitive presence; loan, deposit, and revenue attrition; inconsistencies in standards, control procedures and policies; unexpected issues with costs, operations, personnel, and technology; and problems with the assimilation of new operations, sites or personnel.

 Integration activities could divert resources from regular operations. In addition, general market and economic conditions, governmental actions, natural and human disasters or other international or domestic calamities affecting the financial industry generally may inhibit the Company s successful integration of these Independent. In connection with the proposed acquisition of Independent, we will assume Independent s outstanding debt obligations, and the surviving corporation s level of indebtedness following the completion of the merger could adversely affect the Company s ability to raise additional capital and to meet its obligations under existing indebtedness. In addition, we have proposed to acquire Independent with the expectation that this merger will result in various benefits including, among other things, benefits relating to enhanced revenues, a strengthened and expanded market position for the combined company, technology efficiencies, cost savings and operating efficiencies. Achieving the anticipated benefits of these mergers is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether we integrate the institution in an efficient and effective manner, and general competitive factors in the marketplace. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in a reduction in the price of our shares as well as in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management's time and energy and could materially and adversely affect the Company s financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects.
