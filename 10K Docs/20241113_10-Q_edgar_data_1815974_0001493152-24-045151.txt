million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024. As of September
30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of million. The Company expects to continue to generate operating losses. The
Company expects that its cash and cash equivalents, along with available funding under the Loan and Security Agreement LSA ),
will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least 12 months from the issuance date
of the financial statements. 

Until
such time, if ever, as the Company can generate substantial product revenue from sales of any current or future product candidates, the
Company expects to seek additional funding in order to reach its development and commercialization objectives through various potential
sources, such as equity and debt financings or through collaboration, license and development agreements. The Company may not be able
to obtain funding or enter into collaboration, license or development agreements on acceptable terms, or at all. The terms of any funding
may be dilutive to or adversely affect the rights of the Company s stockholders. If the Company is unable to obtain funding on
satisfactory terms, or at all, the Company could be forced to delay, scale back or eliminate the development of its current or future
product candidates or other business. 

Risks
and uncertainties 

The
Company s future results of operations involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Factors that could affect the Company s
future operating results and cause actual results to vary materially from expectations include uncertainty regarding results of clinical
trials and reaching milestones, uncertainty of regulatory approval of the Company s current or future product candidates, uncertainty
of market acceptance of the Company s product candidates, if approved, competition from substitute products and larger companies,
securing and protecting proprietary technology, ability to establish strategic relationships and dependence on key individuals and sole
source suppliers. Product candidates currently under development will require significant additional research and development efforts,
including extensive preclinical and clinical testing and regulatory approval prior to commercialization. These efforts require significant
amounts of additional capital, adequate personnel and infrastructure and extensive compliance-reporting capabilities and may not ultimately
lead to a marketing approval and commercialization of a product. 

The
Company s product candidates require approvals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA and comparable foreign
regulatory agencies prior to commercial sales in their respective jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that any product candidates
will receive the necessary approvals. If the Company was denied approval, approval was delayed or the Company was unable to maintain
approval for any product candidate, it could have a materially adverse impact on the Company. Even if the Company s product development
and regulatory efforts are successful, it is uncertain when, if ever, the Company will realize significant revenue from product sales.
The Company will need to generate significant revenue to achieve profitability, and it may never do so. 

Basis
of presentation 

The
accompanying condensed financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). Any reference in these notes to applicable guidance is meant to
refer to GAAP as found in the Accounting Standards Codification ASC and Accounting Standards Updates ASU of the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB ). 

The
unaudited interim condensed financial statements of the Company included herein have been prepared, without audit, pursuant to the rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally
included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been omitted from this report, as is permitted by such rules
and regulations. Accordingly, these condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements as of
and for the year ended June 30, 2024 and the notes thereto, which are included in the 2024 Form 10-K. 

In
the opinion of management, the information furnished reflects all adjustments, all of which are of a normal and recurring nature, necessary
for a fair presentation of the results for the reported interim periods. The Company considers events or transactions that occur after
the balance sheet date but before the condensed financial statements are issued to provide additional evidence relative to certain estimates
or to identify matters that require additional disclosure. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative
of results to be expected for the full year or any other interim period.

million are being amortized over three years, the
term of the loan (see Note 10). The balance was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively.
For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company recorded interest expense of million and ,
respectively, related to the amortization of the loan commitment fees. 

and was recorded as research and
development expense in the statement of operations for the period from April 23, 2020 (inception) to June 30, 2020. The license term
shall continue unless and until terminated for cause or insolvency, upon sixty day written notice from the Company, or until such time
as all royalties and other sums cease to be payable in accordance with the terms of the License Agreement. The Company is required to
pay development milestone payments related to clinical trials and granting of marketing authorization ranging from million to 
million, up to a total development milestone payment of million, and sales milestone payments of million and million,
in the first year when cumulative annual net sales of licensed product exceeds million and billion, respectively. The Company
is also required to pay single-digit royalties annual on net product sales over the term of the License Agreement. 

As
part of the initial public offering IPO in May 2021, the Company issued shares of common stock to Vernalis in
lieu of future milestone payments by the Company of approximately million, whether or not the Company achieves those milestones.
The Company has determined that no further milestone payments are considered probable as of September 30, 2024, and therefore no liability
has been recorded. 

to shares. As set forth in the Restated Certificate, as amended, the Company s authorized
capital stock consists of shares of common stock, par value per share, and shares of preferred stock, par
value per share. 

On
September 28, 2022, the Company completed a private placement financing of units (collectively, the Units ), with
each Unit consisting of (i) one share of its common stock and (ii) a warrant to purchase one share of its common stock, for aggregate
gross proceeds of approximately million (or per Unit). The Company received approximately million in net proceeds after
deducting financing fees of approximately million. Each warrant has an exercise price of per share, which is subject to customary
adjustments in the event of any combination or split of the Company s common stock. The warrants expire on September 28, 2027. 

On
November 13, 2023, the Company issued shares of common stock in conjunction with a Loan and Security Agreement see Note
10. 

shares of the Company s common stock. On October 22, 2021, the Company s stockholders
approved an increase of the total authorized shares available for issuance under the 2020 Stock Incentive Plan to shares. Other
awards include restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights and other stock-based awards. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had shares available for
future issuance under the 2020 Stock Incentive Plan. 

The
Company grants non-qualified stock option awards under the 2020 Stock Incentive Plan to its Board of Directors, employees and consultants
of the Company. These awards are subject to the satisfaction of certain performance targets and vesting requirements pursuant to the
award. 

The
Company estimates the fair value of stock-based compensation utilizing the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which is dependent upon
several variables, such as assumptions the Company makes for the volatility of its common stock the expected term of the stock options,
the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term, and the Company s expected dividend yield. Each of
these inputs is subjective and generally requires significant judgement to determine. Stock-based compensation is measured at the grant
date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting
period of the respective award. 

There
were no options granted during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The following table summarizes the range of key assumptions
used to determine the fair value of stock options granted during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

As
of September 30, 2024, unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested stock options totaled approximately million,
which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years. 

The
Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of approximately million and million for the three months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, all of which is included in general and administrative expenses.

JFL has the right, but not the obligation to fund 50 of the Advance at the request of the Company. If JFL elects not to fund 50 of
the Advance, then 22NW will fund 100 of the Advance. The outstanding balance will accrue interest at per annum and no fee will
be assessed on the unused balance. Upon the draw of at least million in the aggregate, the LSA will be collateralized by substantially
all of the Company s assets. All principal drawn and interest accrued under the LSA will be due and payable on the Maturity Date. 

The
Company issued shares of common stock to 22NW upon the signing of the LSA. The Company will also issue shares of common
stock per dollar loaned in each Advance (rounded up or down to the nearest whole share) up to a maximum aggregate of (the Advance

million of a two-year cooperative grant of up to a total of approximately
 million from the National Institute on Drug Abuse NIDA ), part of the National Institutes of Health NIH ),
to support the development of intravenous selonabant, for the potential use as an emergency treatment of acute cannabis-induced toxicities,
including cannabis-induced CNS depression in children. The grant comes in the form of two tranches with the initial award of million
in the first year and subsequent funding of approximately million subject to certain conditions and milestones prior to the second year,
specifically that the Investigational New Drug Application to the FDA for a Phase 1 single ascending dose study of intravenous selonabant
in healthy adults is permitted to proceed or that the FDA has not imposed a clinical hold that cannot be successfully addressed with
available time and resources. 

As
the granting agency does not meet the definition of a customer under Topic 606, the Company accounts for qualifying grant receipts as
other income within the Company s condensed statements of operations. The Company earns income for performing tasks under the grant
agreement. Income is derived from the reimbursement of direct out-of-pocket expenses (including amounts to subrecipients), salaries and
fringe benefits, and certain direct materials costs associated with grant activities. 

At
September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a grant receivable of million, which relates to qualified expenses incurred in connection
with grant activities which have not yet been billed back to the funding agency. The Company recorded million of grant income for
the three months ended September 30, 2024. Collection is deemed probable, and therefore no allowance for credit losses has been established.
There were no receivable amounts at June 30, 2024, and no grant income was recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Overview 

We
are a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company developing treatments for cannabis toxicity, such as unintentional cannabis poisoning, acute
cannabinoid intoxication ACI ), and the broader landscape of acute cannabis-induced conditions. Our lead product candidate,
selonabant (formerly ANEB-001), is intended to rapidly reverse the negative effects of cannabis toxicities and reduce time to recovery.
Unintentional cannabis poisoning primarily occurs in children. Pediatric patients accidentally exposed to cannabis are at risk of serious
and life-threatening outcomes including Central Nervous System CNS depression, respiratory depression, seizures, and
coma. ACI in adults is characterized by signs and symptoms that may include anxiety, panic attacks, agitation, psychosis, and tachycardia.
There is no approved medical treatment currently available to specifically treat ACI or unintentional cannabis poisoning or ACI, and
we are not aware of any competing products that are further along in the development process than selonabant in reversing the effects
of cannabinoids like delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, better known as THC, the principal psychoactive constituent of cannabis. 

Unintentional
cannabis poisoning and ACI have become a widespread health issue in the United States, particularly in the increasing number of states
that have legalized cannabis for medical and recreational use. Unintentional or excessive ingestion of THC via edible products such as
candies and brownies, and intoxication from synthetic cannabinoids (also known as synthetics, including K2 
or spice ), are two potential causes of THC-related emergency room visits. Synthetic cannabinoids are analogous to fentanyl
for opioids insofar as they are more potent at the cannabinoid receptor than their natural product congener THC. 

Hospital
emergency rooms across the United States have seen a dramatic increase in patient visits with cannabis-related conditions. In 2014,
there were an estimated 1.1 million cannabis-related emergency department patient visits, according to data published in Trends
and Characteristics of Cannabis-Associated Emergency Department Visits in the United States, 2006-2018, Drug Alcohol Depend.
2022 Mar 1;232:109288. doi: 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2022.109288. Epub 2022 Jan 10. PMID: 35033959; PMCID: PMC9885359) by Roehler DR,
Hoots BE, Holland KM, Baldwin GT, and Vivolo-Kantor AM, which provided a national estimate analyzing data from The Nationwide
Emergency Department Sample NEDS ), the largest database of U.S. hospital-owned emergency department visits. Based on
our evaluation of a published analysis of the most recent NEDS data, we believe that the number of cannabis related emergency
department visits grew to approximately 1.8 million patients in 2021. We believe the number of cannabis-related emergency department
visits and health problems associated with unintentional cannabis poisoning and ACI will continue to increase substantially as more
states pass laws legalizing cannabis for medical and recreational use. Given the consequences, there is an urgent need for a
treatment to rapidly reverse the symptoms of unintentional cannabis poisoning and ACI.

Previous
clinical trials completed by a third party have shown that oral selonabant is rapidly absorbed, well tolerated and, when repeatedly
administered to obese subjects, leads to weight loss, an effect that is consistent with central antagonism of the cannabinoid
receptor type-1 CB1 ), the primary target of agonists like THC. In March 2021, our European clinical trial application CTA ), which is equivalent to an investigational new drug application in the United States, was accepted in the
Netherlands to allow us to utilize oral selonabant in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 human proof-of-concept
clinical trial for potential use as a treatment for ACI (NCT05282797). The study (the Netherlands Trial was designed to evaluate
the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and effectiveness of a single oral dose of selonabant in treating healthy adult subjects
challenged with THC. On March 28, 2023, we announced complete results from Part A and Part B of the Netherlands Trial, in a total of
134 subjects. Dosing of an additional 20 subjects in an open-label extension of the study Part C was initiated in
July 2023 and the study was completed in August 2023. We met with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA in
July 2023 for a Type B meeting to discuss the Part A and B Phase 2 data and the potential path forward for Phase 3 development of
oral selonabant for the treatment of adult ACI and received the minutes of the meeting in August 2023. The FDA indicated that a
single well-controlled study of oral selonabant in ACI patients presenting to the emergency department combined with a larger THC
challenge study in volunteers could potentially provide substantial evidence to support a new drug application. In addition, an
observational study in patients presenting to emergency departments with ACI is currently ongoing. The study is designed to
determine concentrations of cannabinoids and metabolites in plasma and gather information on signs and symptoms, patients 
disposition and selected assessments, where possible. We believe the data generated from the Netherlands Trial provide support for
our development pathway. 

Rather
than proceeding directly with the Phase 3 studies of oral selonabant in adults with ACI, we are prioritizing the advancement of a selonabant
intravenous (IV) formulation as a potential treatment for pediatric patients with unintentional cannabis poisoning, which we believe
offers the potential for a faster timeline to approval relative to the adult oral product. We are currently scaling up the intravenous
formulation for initial clinical safety studies. 

The
recent decision by the United States Department of Justice to support the rescheduling of marijuana from a schedule I to a schedule III-controlled
substance is a move that we believe will ultimately lead to increased use of cannabis-containing products among US households. This potentially
includes edible products that are often the cause of unintentional cannabis poisoning in children. We have evaluated the potential advantages
of prioritizing a near-term solution for children with more serious symptoms over progressing our plans for clinical studies to support
an adult oral ACI treatment and have decided to focus current efforts on the pediatric indication at this time. Our decision to prioritize
the development of an intravenous treatment for children is driven by multiple factors, including our recent development of a suitable
IV selonabant formulation that enables its use in the pediatric population and our prior discussions with the FDA, which highlighted
the need for an alternative formulation of selonabant for treating younger patients. There is increasing recognition among clinicians
that this is a growing, unmet medical need in a vulnerable population where there are no approved treatments. Our belief
is that the path to approval for an oral treatment for adult ACI may be facilitated by an initial approval for intravenous treatment
of unintentional cannabis poisoning in the pediatric population. Furthermore, with this unprecedented change in cannabis regulation,
Anebulo is uniquely positioned to become a provider of a rapid and clinically impactful solution for Emergency Departments to treat pediatric
patients suffering from unintentional cannabis poisoning. Research has shown children are much more sensitive to the toxic effects of
cannabis. Key factors such as an underdeveloped endocannabinoid system with more CB1 receptors in the brain than adults, and reduced
ability to metabolize THC, contribute to a much greater risk to children. The risk is also evident in how cannabis effects this population;
in contrast to adults who are exposed to acute cannabis toxicity, children are at risk of serious and life-threatening outcomes such
as CNS depression, respiratory depression, seizures, and coma. 

In
May 2020, we entered into a royalty-bearing license agreement with Vernalis Development Limited Vernalis to exploit its
licensed compounds and licensed products to combat symptoms of ACI and substance addiction. We are currently developing our lead product
candidate, selonabant to quickly, and effectively, combat symptoms of ACI. 

Our
lead product candidate is selonabant, a potent, small molecule cannabinoid receptor antagonist, to address the unmet medical need for
a specific antidote for cannabis toxicity. Selonabant is orally bioavailable, rapidly absorbed, and has also been formulated for intravenous
administration. We anticipate that both oral and IV selonabant treatments have the potential to reverse the symptoms of cannabis toxicity. Our proprietary position in the treatment of cannabis toxicity is protected by rights to two patent
applications covering various methods of use of the compound and delivery systems. 

We
were incorporated in Delaware on April 23, 2020, and commenced operations in May 2020. Our operations to date have consisted of organizing
and acquiring the license rights to Vernalis licensed products, assembling an executive team, starting preparations for and conducting
a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial, including the synthesis of a new active pharmaceutical ingredient, the development and filing of a
clinical trial protocol with regulatory agencies in Europe and raising capital. Prior to our initial public offering IPO ),
we funded our operations through a private placement of our series A convertible preferred stock and issuance of two promissory notes
to a related party. 

On
October 24, 2023, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued us U.S. Patent No. 11,795,146 titled Crystalline forms
of a cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) modulator and methods of use and preparation thereof. The issued patent describes crystalline
forms of our investigational drug selonabant and methods of use to treat acute cannabinoid overdose and is expected to provide patent
protection through 2042. 

As
more fully described in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below, on November 13, 2023, we entered into a Loan and Security
Agreement LSA with 22NW, LP 22NW and JFL Capital Management LLC JFL which will allow
us to borrow up to 10 million as needed to fund future operations. The outstanding balance will accrue interest at 0.25 per annum and
no fee will be assessed on the unused balance. The LSA will terminate and all outstanding principal drawn and interest accrued owed there
under shall be due and payable on November 13, 2026 (the Maturity Date ). As of September 30, 2024, there was no balance
outstanding under the LSA. 

11 

On
July 16, 2024, we were awarded the first tranche of 0.9 million of a two-year cooperative grant of up to a total of approximately 1.9
million from the National Institute on Drug Abuse NIDA ), part of the National Institutes of Health NIH ),
to support the development of intravenous selonabant, for the potential use as an emergency treatment of acute cannabis-induced toxicities,
including cannabis-induced CNS depression in children. With the support of NIDA, Anebulo aims to complete IND-enabling activities and
the scale up of its formulation of intravenous selonabant around calendar year end 2024 as it prepares for clinical studies and the Company
expects to enroll the first healthy adult volunteer in the first half of calendar 2025. The grant comes in the form of two tranches with
the initial award of 0.9 million in the first year and subsequent funding of approximately 1 million subject to certain conditions
and milestones prior to the second year, specifically that the Investigational New Drug Application to the FDA for a Phase 1 single ascending
dose study of intravenous selonabant in healthy adults is permitted to proceed or that the FDA has not imposed a clinical hold that cannot
be successfully addressed with available time and resources. 

Components
of Results of Operations 

Revenue 

We
have not generated any revenue since inception. If our development efforts for our current lead product candidate, selonabant, or other
additional product candidates that we may develop in the future, are successful and result in marketing approval, or if we enter into
collaboration or license agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue in the future from a combination of product sales or
payments from such collaboration or license agreements. We cannot predict if, when, or to what extent we will generate revenue from the
commercialization and sale of our product candidates. We have incurred operating losses since inception and expect to continue to incur
significant operating losses and negative cash flows from operations in the future. 

12 

Research
and Development Expenses 

We
expect to continue incurring significant research and development costs related to selonabant. Our research and development expenses
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included research and development consulting expenses, clinical and nonclinical
trials, and other costs, such as third-party and manufacturing costs, associated with development of our lead product candidate, selonabant. 

We
anticipate that our research and development activities will account for a significant portion of our operating expenses and these costs
are expensed as incurred. We expect to significantly increase our research and development efforts as we continue to develop selonabant
and conduct clinical trials with patients suffering from symptoms of cannabis toxicity, as well as continue to expand our product-candidate
pipeline. Research and development expenses include: 

employee-related
 expenses, such as salaries, share-based compensation, benefits and travel expense for research and development personnel; 

direct
 third-party costs such as expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations CROs and contract
 manufacturing organizations CMOs 

costs
 associated with research and development activities of consultants; 

other
 third-party expenses directly attributable to the development of our product candidates; and 

amortization
 expense for future asset purchases used in research and development activities. 

We
currently have one lead product candidate; therefore, we do not track our internal research and development expenses on an indication-by-indication
basis. 

Research
and development activities will continue to be central to our business model. We expect our research and development expenses to be significant
over the next several years as we advance our current clinical development program and prepare to seek regulatory approval. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 consisted primarily of professional fees, stock-based
compensation, insurance, personnel costs and rent.

our Phase 2 proof of concept clinical trial for ACI during the first half of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. Rather than proceeding
directly with the Phase 3 oral ACI studies in adults, we are prioritizing the advancement of a selonabant IV formulation as a potential
treatment for pediatric patients with unintentional cannabis poisoning, which we believe offers the potential for a faster timeline to
approval relative to the adult oral product. We expect our research and development expenses to increase as we continue to scale up the
IV formulation and commence clinical safety studies.

The
overall decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to a decrease in professional and consultant fees,
including legal and investor relations fees, resulting from strategic cost reductions. 

Interest
Expense 

Interest
expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.1 million, compared to zero during the three months ended September 30,
2023. Interest expense is due to the amortization of loan commitment fees in connection with the LSA, which was not entered into until
November 2023, and therefore no expense was recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Interest
Income 

Interest
income during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 26,000, compared to approximately 55,000 during
the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in interest income is due to an overall decrease in cash and cash equivalents
as well as a decrease in interest rates. 

Grant
Income 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized grant income of 0.2 million in connection with our research and development
grant with NIDA. Grant income is derived from the reimbursement of direct out-of-pocket expenses associated with grant activities. There
was no grant income recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2023, as the NIDA grant was not executed until July 2024 and
there were no other comparable grants. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Overview 

Since
our inception in April 2020, we have incurred significant operating losses. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses
in the future as we advance the clinical development of our programs. In May 2021, we completed our IPO in which we received net proceeds
of approximately 19.8 million. On September 28, 2022, we closed a private placement offering, in which we received net proceeds of approximately
 6.3 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 1.4 million. As and if necessary, we will seek to raise
additional funds through various potential sources, such as equity and debt financings or through collaboration, license and development
agreements. We can give no assurances that we will be able to secure such additional sources of funds to support our operations on acceptable
terms or at all, or, if such funds are available to us, that such additional financing will be sufficient to meet our needs. 

Loan
and Security Agreement 

On
November 13, 2023, we entered into the LSA with 22NW and JFL (the Lenders which will allow us to draw up to 10 million
(the Facility Amount as needed to fund future operations until the Maturity Date. Pursuant to the LSA, if we elect to
draw on the Facility Amount (an Advance ), JFL has the right, but not the obligation to fund 50 of the Advance at our request.
If JFL elects not to fund 50 of the Advance, then 22NW is obligated to fund 100 of the Advance. The outstanding balance will accrue
interest at 0.25 per annum and no fee will be assessed on the unused balance. Upon the draw of at least 3 million in the aggregate,
the LSA will be collateralized by substantially all of our assets. All principal drawn and interest accrued under the LSA will be due
and payable on the Maturity Date. 

We
issued 300,000 shares of common stock to 22NW upon the signing of the LSA. We will also issue 0.03 shares of common stock per dollar
loaned in each Advance (rounded up or down to the nearest whole share) up to a maximum aggregate of 300,000 (the Advance Shares 
provided that a minimum of 50,000 Advance Shares will be issued in connection with the first Advance. The Advance Shares shall be issued
to the Lenders on a pro rata basis according to the portion of each Advance such Lender funds. As of September 30, 2024, there was no
balance outstanding under the LSA. 

Joseph
F. Lawler, M.D., Ph.D., our founder and a member of our Board of Directors, is the founder and Managing Member of JFL. Aron R. English,
the President and Portfolio Manager of 22NW, and Nathaniel Calloway, the lead for 22NW, are each members of our Board of Directors.

Cash
Flows 

The
following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows: 

Three Months Ended September 30, 

2024

 Net cash used in operating activities 
 (1,689,989

 Net decrease in cash 
 (1,689,989 
 (2,726,825 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we used cash in operating activities of approximately 1.7 million primarily resulting from
our net loss of 2.2 million, partially offset by non-cash related stock-based compensation and loan commitment amortization totaling
approximately 0.3 million, and a change in operating assets and liabilities of approximately 0.2 million. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2023, we used cash in operating activities of approximately 2.7 million primarily resulting from
our net loss of 2.5 million, partially offset by non-cash related stock-based compensation of approximately 0.2 million, and a change
in operating assets and liabilities of approximately 0.5 million. 

Funding
and Material Cash Requirements 

We
expect that our cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024, along with access to the Facility Amount under the LSA, will enable
us to fund our current and planned operating expenses and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months from the filing of this
Quarterly Report. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be imprecise, and we may exhaust our available
capital resources sooner that we currently expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of
our programs, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenses associated with completing the
research and development of our product candidates. 

Our 
present and future funding and cash requirements will depend on many factors, including, among other things: 

the
 progress, timing and completion of our ongoing and planned clinical trials and nonclinical studies; 

our
 ability to receive, and the timing of receipt of, future regulatory approvals for our product candidates and the costs related thereto; 

the
 scope, progress, results and costs of our ongoing and planned operations; 

the
 costs associated with expanding our operations and building our sales and marketing capabilities; 

our
 ability to establish strategic collaborations; 

the
 cost and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights
 and defending any intellectual property-related claims; 

the
 revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our products, if approved; and 

potential
 new product candidates we identify and attempt to develop. 

Until
such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue from sales of any of our current or future product candidates, to
support our material cash requirements in the near-term (within one year) and long-term (beyond one year), we will need to seek additional
equity or debt financing or potential collaboration, license or development agreements to provide the capital required to maintain or
expand our operations, continue the development of our product candidate, build our sales and marketing capabilities, promote brand identity,
develop or acquire complementary technologies, products or businesses, or provide for our working capital requirements and other operating
and general corporate purposes. If we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities and/or equity-linked securities, the percentage
ownership of our existing stockholders may be reduced, and accordingly these stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may
also issue equity securities and/or equity-linked securities that provide rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our common
stock. The LSA does, and any additional debt financing, if obtained, may, involve agreements that include liens on our assets and covenants
limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt. Debt financing could also be required
to be repaid regardless of our operating results. If we raise funds through collaborations, license or development agreements, we may
be required to relinquish some rights to our current or future products or revenue streams or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable
to us. If such financing is not available on satisfactory terms, or is not available at all, we may be required to delay, scale back
or eliminate the development of our current or future product candidates and other business. 

Contractual
Obligations and Commitments 

License
Agreement with Vernalis Development Limited 

On
May 26, 2020, we entered into an exclusive license agreement (the License Agreement with Vernalis Development Limited,
formerly Vernalis (R D) Limited Vernalis ). Pursuant to the License Agreement, Vernalis granted us an exclusive worldwide
royalty-bearing license to develop and commercialize a compound that we refer to as selonabant, as well as access to and a right of reference
with respect to any regulatory materials under its control. The License Agreement allows us to sublicense the rights thereunder to any
person with similar or greater financial resources and expertise without Vernalis prior consent, provided the proposed sublicensee
is not developing or commercializing a product that contains a CB1 antagonist or is for the same indication covered by the trials or
market authorization for selonabant. In exchange for the exclusive license, we agreed to pay Vernalis a non-refundable signature fee
of 0.2 million, total potential developmental milestone payments of up to 29.9 million (of which 0.4 million has been paid), total
potential sales milestone payments of up to 35.0 million, and low to mid-single digit royalties on net sales. 

15 

We
have the sole discretion to carry out the development and commercialization of selonabant, including obtaining regulatory approvals,
and we are responsible for all costs and expenses in connection therewith. We have access to certain regulatory materials, including
study reports from clinical and non-clinical trials, under Vernalis control. We agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts
to (i) develop and commercialize selonabant in the United States and certain European countries and (ii) conduct dose a patient as part
of a Phase 2 and human clinical trial within two years of the commencement date of the License Agreement (which obligation we have met),
and dose a patient as part of a Pivotal Trial (as such term is defined in the License Agreement) within four years of commencement of
the License Agreement, which period was in accordance with the terms of the License Agreement extended for a nominal fee. We also agreed
to provide Vernalis with periodic reports of our activities and notice of market authorization within specified timeframes. 

Office
Lease, Manufacturing Contract and CRO Contract 

We
manage our business operations from our principal executive office in Lakeway, Texas, in leased space under a sublease with a related
party for approximately 400 per month. 

We
have a manufacturing agreement with a third-party CMO. The total cost for the current contract is approximately 3.0 million. The manufacturing
aspect of this contract was substantially completed as of June 30, 2024. The stability study aspect of the contract is expected to be
fully incurred during calendar 2026. 

We
enter into contracts in the normal course of business with clinical trial sites and clinical supply manufacturers and other services
and products for operating purposes. These contracts generally provide for termination after a notice period, and therefore, are cancellable
contracts. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

Our
condensed financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S.
GAAP ). The preparation of our condensed financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and judgments
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, costs and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
in our condensed financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors
that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values
of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis.
Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

While
our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the audited financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2024, and
notes thereto, which are included in our 2024 Form 10-K that was filed with the SEC on September 25, 2024, we believe that the following
accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our condensed financial statements. 

Accrued
Research and Development Expenses 

As
part of the process of preparing our condensed financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development
expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that
have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated costs incurred for the services when
we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears
for services performed and some require advanced payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses of each balance sheet date in our
condensed financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Examples of estimated accrued research and
development expenses include fees paid to: 

CROs
 in connection with performing research services on our behalf and any clinical trials; 

investigative
 sites or other providers in connection with studies and any clinical trials; 

vendors
 in connection with the preparation of our NDA filing, market and patient awareness programs, market research and analysis and medical
 education; and 

vendors
 related to product manufacturing, development and distribution of clinical supplies. 

16 

We
base our expenses for services rendered on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes, contracts
and communicating with our vendors. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract
and may result in uneven payments. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided
and result in a prepayment of the expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed
and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies
from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or amount of prepaid or accrued expenses accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates
to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative
to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in
any particular period. 

Stock-Based
Compensation Expense 

Our
2020 Stock Incentive Plan provides for the grant of qualified incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options or other awards
to our employees, officers, directors, advisors, and outside consultants for the purchase of up to 3,650,000 shares of our common stock.
Other awards include restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights and other stock-based awards. Other stock-based
awards are awards valued in whole or in part by reference to, or are otherwise based on, shares of common stock. Stock options generally
vest over a four-year period, at achievement of a performance requirement, or upon change of control (as defined in the applicable plan).
The awards expire in five to ten years from the date of grant. 

The
fair value of stock options we grant is estimated using the Black Scholes option pricing model. This option pricing model based on certain
subjective assumptions, including (i) the expected stock price volatility, (ii) the expected term of the award, (iii) the risk-free rate
of interest, and (iv) expected dividends. The fair value of our common stock utilized in the model is determined based on the quoted
closing market price of our common stock as reported by Nasdaq on the date of grant. 

There
were no significant changes to assumptions used to value options using the Black Scholes option pricing model during the three months
ended September 30, 2024. 

JOBS
Act Accounting Election 

The
Jumpstart Our Business Startups JOBS Act, enacted in April 2012, permits an emerging growth company such
as us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies
until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have and intend to continue to take advantage of all of the reduced
reporting requirements and exemptions, including the longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting
standards, for an emerging growth company under Section 107 of the JOBS Act. Our election to use the phase-in periods may make it difficult
to compare our financial statements to those of non-emerging growth companies and other emerging growth companies that have opted out
of the phase-in periods under Section 107 of the JOBS Act. See Risk Factors in our 2024 Form 10-K and our election to delay
adoption of new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies may result in our financial statements not being comparable
to those of some other public companies. As a result of this and other reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth
companies, our securities may be less attractive to investors.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As
of September 30, 2024, management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
of the Exchange Act. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports
we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

Any
controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control
objective and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the design
and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

From
time to time, we may be a party to litigation or subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of business. Although the results
of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we currently believe that the final outcome of these ordinary course matters
will not have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because
of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. We are not currently a party to any material legal
proceedings, and our management believes that there are currently no claims or actions pending against us, the ultimate disposition of
which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

We
are subject to various risks that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks or uncertainties, they may include, but are not limited to, the factors
discussed under Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of the Company s 2024 Form 10-K that was filed with the SEC on September
25, 2024. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also have a material
adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Except as set forth below, there have been no other material
changes to our risk factors since our aforementioned Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

We
have not generated any revenue since our inception and expect to incur future losses and may never become profitable. 

We
have not generated any revenue. As of September 30, 2024, we have an accumulated deficit of 67.6 million, which includes a fair value
adjustment of 26.6 million for warrants converted into Series A preferred stock on a cashless basis in connection with our IPO. The
likelihood of our future success must be considered in light of the expenses, difficulties, complications and delays often encountered
by companies in clinical development, including in connection with ongoing and future clinical trials and the emergence of competing
products or therapies. These potential challenges include unanticipated clinical trial delays, poor data, changes in the regulatory and
competitive landscape and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current budget estimates. In order to complete certain clinical
trials and otherwise operate pursuant to our current business strategy, we anticipate that we will incur increased operating expenses.
In addition, we expect to incur significant losses and experience negative cash flow in the future as we fund our operating losses and
capital expenditures. We recognize that if we are unable to generate sufficient revenues or source funding, we will not be able to continue
operations as currently contemplated, complete planned clinical trials and/or achieve profitability. Our failure to achieve or maintain
profitability will also negatively impact the value of our shares. If we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks, then we may need
to curtail our business activities. 

The
future success of our business cannot be determined at this time, and we do not anticipate generating revenue from product sales in the
near term. In addition, we have no experience in obtaining regulatory approval for and commercializing drug products on our own and face
a number of challenges with respect to development and commercialization efforts, including, among other challenges: 

having
 inadequate financial or other resources to complete the development of our product candidate; 

the
 inability to manufacture our product in commercial quantities, at an adequate quality, at an acceptable cost or in collaboration
 with third parties; 

experiencing
 delays or unplanned expenditures in product development, clinical testing or manufacturing; 

the
 inability to establish adequate sales, marketing and distribution channels; 

healthcare
 professionals may not adopt and patients may not accept our drug, if approved for marketing; 

we
 may not be aware of possible complications or other side effects from the use of our product since we have limited clinical experience
 with respect to the actual effects from use of our product; 

technological
 breakthroughs in reversing cannabis toxicity and treating patients experiencing intoxication symptoms may reduce the demand for our
 product, if it develops; 

changes
 in the market for reversing cannabis toxicity and treating patients experiencing intoxication symptoms, new alliances between existing
 market participants and the entrance of new market participants may interfere with our market penetration efforts; 

third-party
 payors may not agree to reimburse patients for any or all of the purchase price of our product, which may adversely affect patients 
 willingness to use our product; 

uncertainty
 as to market demand may result in inefficient pricing of our product; 

we
 may face third-party claims of intellectual property infringement; 

we
 may fail to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals for our product in our markets or may face adverse regulatory or legal actions
 relating to our product even if regulatory approval is obtained; and 

we
 are dependent upon the results of clinical studies relating to our product and the products of our competitors. If data from a clinical
 trial is unfavorable, we would be reluctant to advance the product for the indication for which it was being developed. 

19 

If
we are unable to meet any one or more of these challenges successfully, our ability to effectively obtain regulatory approval for and
commercialize our products could be limited, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations. 

We
currently have no product revenue and will need to raise additional capital in the future, which may be unavailable to us or may cause
dilution or place significant restrictions on our ability to operate. 

We
may be unable to generate sufficient revenue or cash flow to fund our operations. We expect that our cash and cash equivalents at September
30, 2024, along with access to funding under the LSA, will enable us to fund our current and planned operating expenses and capital expenditures
into the fourth quarter of calendar year 2025. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect,
and we may exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated
with the development of our programs, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenses associated
with completing the research and development of our product candidate. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product
revenue from sales of any of our current or future product candidates, we will need to seek additional equity or debt financing or potential
collaboration, license or development agreements to provide the capital required to maintain or expand our operations, continue the development
of our product candidate, build our sales and marketing capabilities, promote brand identity, develop or acquire complementary technologies,
products or businesses, or provide for our working capital requirements and other operating and general corporate purposes. 

Other
than the LSA, we currently do not have any arrangements or credit facilities as a source of funds, and we make no assurance that we will
be able to raise sufficient additional capital in the future if needed on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we draw down the entire
 10 million available under the LSA, we will still require additional funding to fund our planned operations and capital expenditures.
If such financing is not available on satisfactory terms, or is not available at all, we may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate
the development of our current or future product candidates and other business, seek collaborations,
or amend existing collaborations, for research and development programs at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or for
the development of programs that we otherwise would have sought to develop independently, or on terms that are less favorable than might
otherwise be available, dispose of technology assets, or relinquish or license on unfavorable terms, our rights to technologies or any
future product candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves, p ursue
the sale of our company to a third party at a price that may result in a loss on investment for our stockholders, file for bankruptcy
or cease operations altogether. This may materially adversely affect our operations and financial condition as well as our ability to
achieve business objectives and maintain competitiveness. 

If
we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities and/or equity-linked securities, the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders
may be reduced, and accordingly these stockholders may experience substantial dilution. In addition, the LSA requires that we issue 0.03
shares of common stock per dollar loaned under the LSA, which will result in dilution to shareholders. We may also issue equity securities
and/or equity-linked securities that provide for rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock. Given our need
for cash and that equity and equity-linked issuances are very common types of fundraising for companies like us, the risk of dilution
is particularly significant for our stockholders. 

The
LSA includes, and future debt financing, if obtained, may involve agreements that include liens on our assets and covenants limiting
or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt. Debt financing, including the LSA, could also
be required to be repaid regardless of our operating results. 

If
we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish some rights to our current
or future products or revenue streams or to grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. 

Any
additional capital raising efforts may divert the attention of our management from day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect
our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates.
