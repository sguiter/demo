. Early is permitted in any annual or interim period as of the beginning of the related fiscal year. The adoption of this pronouncement is t expected to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. ASU 2023-02 Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323) In March 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-02, Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method. ASU 2023-02 allows reporting entities to elect to account for qualifying tax equity investments using the proportional amortization method, regardless of the program giving rise to the related income tax credits. The ASU s amendments remove the specialized guidance for [low-income-housing tax credit] investments that are not accounted for using the proportional amortization method and instead require that those LIHTC investments be accounted for using the guidance in other [GAAP]. For Wesbanco, the amendments were effective on . The of this pronouncement did t have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. ASU 2023-01 - Leases (Topic 842): Common Control Arrangements In March 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-01, Leases (Topic 842): Common Control Arrangements. ASU 2023-01 amends certain provisions of ASC 842 that apply to arrangements between related parties under common control. Additionally, ASU 2023-01 amends the accounting for leasehold improvements in common-control arrangements for all entities. For Wesbanco, the amendments were effective on . The of this pronouncement did t have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. ASU 2022-04 - Liabilities Supplier Finance Programs (Sub-topic 405-50) In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, Liabilities Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50). The amendments in this ASU require that a buyer in a supplier finance program disclose sufficient information about the program to allow a user of financial statements to understand the program s nature, activity during the period, changes from period to period, and potential magnitude. To achieve that objective, the buyer should disclose qualitative and quantitative information about its supplier finance programs. For Wesbanco, this update was effective beginning on January 1, 2023, except for the amendment on rollforward information, which was effective on . As this is not part of Wesbanco's current business activities, the of this full pronouncement did t have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. ASU 2022-03 - Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, "Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820). The amendments in this ASU clarify that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security, and therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. Furthermore, the amendments to this ASU clarify that an entity cannot, as a separate unit of account, recognize and measure a contractual sale restriction. The update to this ASU requires the following disclosures for equity securities: (1) the fair value of equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions reflected in the balance sheet; (2) the nature and remaining duration of the restriction(s) and; (3) the circumstances that could cause a lapse in the restriction(s). The amendments in this Update were effective on . The of this pronouncement did t have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

billion in assets, billion in portfolio loans, billion in deposits, billion in stockholders equity and branches as of September 30, 2024. Under the terms of the Agreement, Wesbanco will exchange its common stock for Premier common stock at closing, subject to customary conditions. Premier options will be exchanged for Wesbanco options, as adjusted as to exercise price and number of options to take into account the fixed exchange ratio stated in the Agreement. Premier shareholders will be entitled to receive shares of Wesbanco common stock per each share of Premier common stock. The receipt by Premier shareholders of shares of Wesbanco common stock in exchange for their shares of Premier common stock is anticipated to qualify as a tax-free exchange. The merger remains subject to the approvals of the appropriate banking regulatory authorities and the shareholders of both companies. Wesbanco has filed an amended Form S-4 with the SEC regarding the proposed merger with Premier, which was effective on October 28, 2024. The special shareholders meetings of both companies are scheduled for December 11, 2024. It is currently expected that the transaction will be completed in the first quarter of 2025. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Wesbanco recorded merger-related expenses of million related to the Premier acquisition.

As of September 30, 2024 and 2023 , and options to purchase shares were not included in the diluted share computation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, because the exercise price was greater than the average market price of a common share, and, therefore, the effect would be antidilutive. As of September 30, 2024 , shares were estimated to be awarded under the 2024, 2023 and 2022 total shareholder return ("TSR") plans and were not included in the diluted calculation as stock performance targets had not been met and the effect would be antidilutive. As of September 30, 2023 , shares were estimated to be awarded under the 2023, 2022 and 2021 TSR plans, as stock performance targets had not been met as of such date and therefore the effect would be antidilutive. In addition, performance-based restricted stock ("PBRS") compensation totaling and shares were estimated to be awarded as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively As previously disclosed in Form 8-K, in conjunction with the announcement of the pending acquisition of Premier, on August 1, 2024, Wesbanco issued shares of common stock to complete a million common equity capital raise. This equity issuance was primarily to support the pro-forma bank's balance sheet and regulatory capital ratios. These shares are included in average shares outstanding beginning on that date.

The corporate and municipal bonds in Wesbanco s held-to-maturity debt portfolio are analyzed quarterly to determine if an allowance for current expected credit losses is warranted. Wesbanco uses a database of historical financials of all corporate and municipal issuers and actual historic default and recovery rates on rated and non-rated transactions to estimate expected credit losses on an individual security basis. The expected credit losses are adjusted quarterly and are recorded in an allowance for expected credit losses on the balance sheet, which is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the held-to-maturity portfolio as a contra asset. The losses are recorded on the consolidated income statement in the provision for credit losses. Accrued interest receivable on held-to-maturity securities, which was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively, is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. Held-to-maturity investments in U.S. Government sponsored entities and agencies as well as mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, which are all either issued by a direct governmental entity or a government-sponsored entity, have no historical evidence supporting expected credit losses; therefore, Wesbanco has estimated these losses at , and will monitor this assumption in the future for any economic or governmental policies that could affect this assumption.

Unrealized losses on debt securities in the table above represent temporary fluctuations resulting from changes in market rates in relation to fixed yields. Unrealized losses in the available-for-sale portfolio are accounted for as an adjustment, net of taxes, to other comprehensive income in shareholders equity. Wesbanco does not believe the securities presented above are impaired due to reasons of credit quality, as substantially all debt securities are rated above investment grade and all are paying principal and interest according to their contractual terms. Wesbanco does not intend to sell, nor is it more likely than not that it will be required to sell, loss position securities prior to recovery of their cost; therefore, management believes the unrealized losses detailed above do not require an allowance for credit losses relating to these securities to be recognized. Securities that do not have readily determinable fair values and for which Wesbanco does not exercise significant influence are carried at cost. Cost method investments consist primarily of Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB of Pittsburgh stock totaling million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and are included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cost method investments are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances suggest that their carrying value may not be recoverable.

Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses under the current expected credit losses methodology ("CECL") is calculated utilizing the probability of default ("PD") divided by the loss given default ("LGD"), which is then discounted to net present value. PD is the probability the asset will default within a given time frame and LGD is the percentage of the asset not expected to be collected due to default. The primary macroeconomic drivers of the quantitative model include forecasts of national unemployment and interest rates, as well as modeling adjustments for changes in prepayment speeds, loan risk grades, portfolio mix, concentrations and loan growth. At September 30, 2024 , the primary drivers of the change in the allowance model calculation from December 31, 2023 were continued loan growth, adjustments in regional macroeconomic factors and loan concentrations, a specific reserve on one C I credit and an increase in net charge-offs. The forecast was based upon a probability weighted approach which is designed to incorporate loss projections from a baseline, upside and downside economy. Due to the nonlinearity of credit losses to the economy, the asymmetry is best captured by evaluating multiple economic scenarios through a probability weighted approach. At quarter-end, national unemployment was projected to be , and subsequently increase to an average of over the remainder of the forecast period. In addition to the quantitative and qualitative changes noted above, the allowance is reflective of million in net charge-offs recorded during the first nine months of 2024. Accrued interest receivable for loans was million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. Wesbanco made an accounting policy election to exclude accrued interest from the measurement of the allowance for credit losses because the Company has a policy in place to reverse or write-off accrued interest when loans are placed on non-accrual. However, due to their unique nature, Wesbanco does have a million reserve on the accrued interest related to individually-evaluated loans. In addition, Wesbanco also has a million reserve on the accrued interest related to loan modifications allowed under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security ("CARES") Act due to the timing and nature of these modifications. Accrued interest related to COVID-19 loan modifications as permitted under the CARES Act was million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 Commercial Loan Risk Grades Commercial loan risk grades are determined based on an evaluation of the relevant characteristics of each loan, assigned at inception and adjusted thereafter at any time to reflect changes in the risk profile throughout the life of each loan. The primary factors used to determine the risk grade are the sufficiency, reliability and sustainability of the primary source of repayment and overall financial strength of the borrower. The rating system more heavily weights the debt service coverage, leverage and loan to value factors to derive the risk grade. Other factors that are considered at a lesser weighting include management, industry or property type risks, payment history, collateral or guarantees. Commercial real estate land and construction consists of loans to finance investments in vacant land, land development, construction of residential housing, and construction of commercial buildings. Commercial real estate improved property consists of loans for the purchase or refinance of all types of improved owner-occupied and investment properties. Factors that are considered in assigning the risk grade vary depending on the type of property financed. The risk grade assigned to construction and development loans is based on the overall viability of the project, the experience and financial capacity of the developer or builder to successfully complete the project, project specific and market absorption rates and comparable property values, and the amount of pre-sales for residential housing construction or pre-leases for commercial investment property. The risk grade assigned to commercial investment property loans is based primarily on the adequacy of the net operating income generated by the property to service the debt debt service coverage ), the loan to appraised value, the type, quality, industry and mix of tenants, and the terms of leases. The risk grade assigned to owner-occupied commercial real estate is based primarily on global debt service coverage and the leverage of the business, but may also consider the industry in which the business operates, the business specific competitive advantages or disadvantages, collateral margins and the quality and experience of management. Commercial and industrial C I loans consist of revolving lines of credit to finance accounts receivable, inventory and other general business purposes; term loans to finance fixed assets other than real estate, and letters of credit to support trade, insurance or governmental requirements for a variety of businesses. Most C I borrowers are privately-held companies with annual sales up to million. Primary factors that are considered in risk rating C I loans include debt service coverage and leverage. Other factors including operating trends, collateral coverage along with management experience are also considered.

million and million, respectively, invested in these partnerships. Wesbanco also recognizes the unconditional unfunded equity commitments of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, within other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Wesbanco classifies the amortization of the investment as a component of income tax expense (benefit) and proportionally amortizes the investment over the tax credit period. The amortization for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was million and million, respectively, and was million and million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . Tax benefits attributed to these partnerships include low-income housing and historic tax credits, which are projected to total million for 2024 , and totaled million for 2023, which are also included in income tax expense. Wesbanco is also a limited partner in other limited partnerships as of September 30, 2024. These provide seed money and capital to startup companies, and financing to low-income housing projects. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , Wesbanco had million and million invested in these partnerships, which are recorded in other assets using the equity method.

Risk participation agreements are entered into as financial guarantees of performance on interest rate swap derivatives. The purchased asset or sold liability allows Wesbanco to participate-in (fee received) or participate-out (fee paid) the risk associated with certain derivative positions executed by the borrower of the lead bank in a loan syndication. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , Wesbanco had and risk participation-in agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million and million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , Wesbanco had and risk participation-out agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million and million, respectively. Mortgage Loans Held for Sale and Interest Rate Lock Commitments Certain residential mortgage loans are originated for sale in the secondary mortgage loan market. These loans are classified as held for sale and carried at fair value as Wesbanco has elected the fair value option. Fair value is determined based on rates obtained from the secondary market for loans with similar characteristics. Wesbanco sells loans to the secondary market on either a mandatory or best efforts basis. The loans sold on a mandatory basis are not committed to an investor until the loan is closed with the borrower. Wesbanco enters into forward to be announced TBA contracts to manage the interest rate risk between the lock commitment and the closing of the loan. The total balance of forward TBA contracts entered into was million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The loans sold on a best efforts basis are committed to an investor simultaneous to the interest rate commitment with the borrower, and as a result, the Company does not enter into a separate forward TBA contract to offset the fair value risk as the investor accepts such risk in exchange for paying a lower premium on sale. Fair Values of Derivative Instruments on the Balance Sheet All derivatives are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. Derivative assets are classified in the consolidated balance sheet under other assets, and derivative liabilities are classified in the consolidated balance sheet under other liabilities. Changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. None of Wesbanco s derivatives are designated in a qualifying hedging relationship under ASC 815.

Credit-risk-related Contingent Features Wesbanco has agreements with its derivative counterparties that contain a provision, which provides that if Wesbanco defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then Wesbanco could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations. Wesbanco also has agreements with certain of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where if Wesbanco fails to maintain its status as either a well or adequately-capitalized institution, then the counterparty could terminate the derivative positions and Wesbanco would be required to settle its obligations under the agreements. Wesbanco has minimum collateral posting thresholds with certain of its derivative counterparties and has posted collateral with a market value of million as of September 30, 2024. If Wesbanco had breached any of these provisions at September 30, 2024, it could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at the termination value and would have been required to pay any additional amounts due in excess of amounts previously posted as collateral with the respective counterparties. In certain market situations, Wesbanco can also request collateral from the derivative counterparties. At December 31, 2023 , Wesbanco held net cash collateral from various derivative counterparties totaling million within interest bearing deposit accounts.

The following methods and assumptions were used to measure the fair value of financial instruments recorded at cost on Wesbanco s consolidated balance sheets: Cash and due from banks: The carrying amount for cash and due from banks is a reasonable estimate of fair value. Held-to-maturity debt securities: Fair values for debt securities held-to-maturity are determined in the same manner as investment securities, which are described above. The carrying value is net of the allowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity debt securities. Net loans: Fair values for loans are estimated in a valuation model using a discounted cash flow methodology. The discount rates take into account interest rates currently being offered to customers for loans with similar terms, the credit risk associated with the loan and other market factors, including liquidity. Wesbanco believes the discount rates are consistent with transactions occurring in the marketplace for both performing and distressed loan types. The carrying value is net of the allowance for loan losses and other associated premiums and discounts. Due to the significant judgment involved in evaluating credit quality, loans are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Accrued interest receivable: The carrying amount of accrued interest receivable approximates its fair value . Deposits: The carrying amount is considered a reasonable estimate of fair value for demand, savings and other variable rate deposit accounts. The fair value of fixed maturity certificates of deposit is estimated by a discounted cash flow method using rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings: The fair value of FHLB borrowings is based on rates currently available to Wesbanco for borrowings with similar terms and remaining maturities. Other borrowings: The carrying amount of federal funds purchased and overnight sweep accounts generally approximate fair value. Other repurchase agreements are based on quoted market prices if available. If market prices are not available, for certain fixed and adjustable rate repurchase agreements, then quoted market prices of similar instruments are used. Subordinated debt and junior subordinated debt: The fair value of subordinated debt is determined primarily by obtaining quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges or matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique used widely in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities relationship to other similar securities. These securities are classified within level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Due to the pooled nature of junior subordinated debt owed to unconsolidated subsidiary trusts, which are not actively traded, estimated fair value is determined by using comparable corporate bond indices and swap rates from the financial services sector and factoring in the applicable credit spreads and optional early redemption provisions. Accrued interest payable: The carrying amount of accrued interest payable approximates its fair value. Off-balance sheet financial instruments: Off-balance sheet financial instruments consist of commitments to extend credit, including letters of credit. Fair values for commitments to extend credit are estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the present credit standing of the counterparties. The estimated fair value of the commitments to extend credit and letters of credit are insignificant and therefore are not presented in the above tables.

Letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by banks to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including normal business activities, bond financing and similar transactions. Letters of credit are considered guarantees. The liability associated with letters of credit was million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Contingent obligations to purchase loans funded by other entities include credit card guarantees, loans sold with recourse as well as obligations to the FHLB.

(1) Non-GAAP net income excludes after-tax restructuring and merger-related expenses. The above non-GAAP financial measures used by Wesbanco provide information useful to investors in understanding Wesbanco s operating performance and trends and facilitate comparisons with the performance of Wesbanco s peers. 

Net interest income increased 3.5 million or 2.9 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same quarter of 2023, due to increases in earning asset yields and loan growth slightly outpacing increases in interest bearing liabilities. Over the same time period, the yield on earning assets increased by a total of 47 basis points while the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased by 69 basis points from increasing deposit costs and higher cost wholesale borrowings. Average loan balances increased by 9.6 from the third quarter of 2023, mainly attributable to commercial loan demand, while average securities decreased by 7.0 over the same time period as investment maturities and calls were used to partially fund the loan growth. Average deposits increased 5.0 over the same time period as a result of deposit gathering and retention efforts by the retail and commercial teams. Accretion from prior acquisitions benefited both the third quarter 2024 and third quarter 2023 net interest margin by two basis points. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income decreased 11.9 million or 3.3 from the first nine months of 2023 due to the impact of rising rates on deposit and borrowing costs exceeding that of loan growth and earning asset yields on a year-to-date basis. 
 Loan growth and adjustments in regional macroeconomic factors and loan concentrations resulted in a provision for credit losses of 4.8 million in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to a provision of 6.3 million in the third quarter of 2023. Annualized net loan charge-offs, as a percentage of average portfolio loans, were 0.05 and 0.01 for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 For the third quarter of 2024, non-interest income decreased 1.3 million, or 4.1 compared to the third quarter of 2023, due to decreases in net swap fee and valuation income. The net swap fee and valuation loss of 0.6 million in the third quarter of 2024 reflected 1.1 million of new swap fees and 1.7) million in net fair value adjustments, as compared to 2.5 million in fees and 1.4 million in net fair value adjustments, in the prior year third quarter. Slightly offsetting this decrease, trust fees increased 0.8 million from the third quarter of 2023, reflecting higher assets under management from organic growth and market value appreciation, and service charges on deposits increased 1.2 million from the third quarter of 2023, reflecting fee income from new products and services and increased general consumer spending. 
 Non-interest expense, excluding restructuring and merger-related expenses, increased in the third quarter of 2024 by 1.9 million, or 2.0 , to 99.2 million, compared to the third quarter of 2023, reflecting increased equipment and software expense, FDIC insurance expense and other operating expenses. Equipment and software expense increased 1.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior year third quarter reflecting the impact of prior year ATM upgrades, which were phased in throughout the prior year. FDIC insurance expense increased in the third quarter of 2024 by 0.5 million due to an increase in the minimum rate for all banks. Other operating expenses increased 1.5 million in the third quarter of 2024 from the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to higher costs and fees in support of loan growth and higher other miscellaneous expenses. Offsetting these increases somewhat are decreases in salaries and wages and employee benefits expense, primarily due to lower staffing levels as a result of efficiency improvements in the mortgage and branch staffing models. 
 For the first nine months of 2024, the effective tax rate was 17.3 as compared to 17.6 for the first nine months of 2023, and the provision for income taxes decreased by 5.2 million over the same time period. The decrease in the provision for income taxes and effective tax rate is due to the decrease in pre-tax income over the same period.

Net interest income, which is Wesbanco s largest source of revenue, is the difference between interest income on earning assets, primarily loans and securities, and interest expense on liabilities, primarily deposits and short and long-term borrowings. Net interest income is affected by the general level of, and changes in interest rates, the steepness and shape of the yield curve, changes in the amount and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, as well as the frequency of repricing of existing assets and liabilities. Net interest income increased 3.5 million or 2.9 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. The increase is due to an increase of average portfolio loans of 9.6 in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023, due to strong new loan growth and strategic loan production office and lender hiring initiatives. Conversely, net interest income decreased 11.9 million or 3.3 in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023. This decrease was due to a 25 basis point decrease year over year in the net interest margin to 2.94 for the first nine months of 2024. The decrease in margin is due to higher funding costs and the associated remix from non-interest bearing deposits into higher tier money market and certificate of deposit accounts. Total purchase accounting accretion was flat in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023, as approximately two basis points of accretion from prior acquisitions was included in each quarter's net interest margin. Total average deposits increased by 654.4 million or 5.0 in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023. The cost of interest bearing deposits increased by 84 basis points and the cost of total interest bearing liabilities increased by 69 basis points from the third quarter of 2023 to the third quarter of 2024. The increase in the cost is primarily due to rate increases for interest bearing deposits in response to the general increase in overall deposit rates in the marketplace. 
 Interest income increased 30.1 million or 16.4 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 and 91.9 million or 17.7 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. Average loan balances increased 1.1 billion or 9.6 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, while loan yields increased by 47 basis points during this same period to 5.93 due to the previously mentioned rising rate environment and its effect on the repricing of portfolio loans. Loans provide the greatest impact on interest income and the yield on earning assets as they have the largest balance and the highest yield within major earning asset categories. In the third quarter of 2024, average loans represented 75.1 of average earning assets, an increase from 72.5 in the third quarter of 2023. Average total securities balances decreased 269.9 million or 7.0 from the third quarter of 2023, and represented 21.9 of total earning assets in the third quarter of 2024. Taxable securities yields increased by 14 basis points in the third quarter of 2024 from the third quarter of 2023. Tax-exempt securities yields, which are the highest yields within total securities, increased two basis points from the third quarter of 2023. 
 Interest expense increased 26.7 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 103.7 million in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023, due to the timing of the prior year federal funds rate increases and their effect on the costs of deposits and borrowings. The cost of interest bearing liabilities increased by 69 basis points from the third quarter of 2023 to 3.21 in the third quarter of 2024. Average interest bearing deposits increased 1.1 billion or 12.1 from the third quarter of 2023. The rate on interest bearing deposits increased 84 basis points to 2.85 from the third quarter of 2023, primarily from increases in rates on interest bearing public funds, money market funds and savings deposits, and a mix shift from non-interest bearing demand deposits into interest bearing demand deposits and certificates of deposit. Average non-interest bearing demand deposit balances decreased from the third quarter of 2023 to the third quarter of 2024 by 408.3 million or 9.7 , and were 28.0 of total average deposits at September 30, 2024, compared to 32.5 at September 30, 2023, reflecting customers' preferences in the previously mentioned interest rate environment. For the third quarter of 2024, Wesbanco's average loans to average deposits ratio was 90.6 , reflecting additional capacity to lend. The average balance of FHLB borrowings increased 43.7 million from the third quarter of 2023 to the third quarter of 2024. The average balance of repurchase agreements and subordinated and junior subordinated debt balances remain virtually unchanged from the third quarter of 2023 to the third quarter of 2024.

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES LOANS AND LOAN COMMITMENTS 
 The provision for credit losses loans is the amount to be added to the allowance for credit losses loans after net charge-offs have been deducted to bring the allowance to a level considered appropriate to absorb lifetime expected losses for all portfolio loans. The provision for credit losses loan commitments is the amount to be added to the allowance for credit losses for loan commitments to bring that allowance to a level considered appropriate to absorb lifetime expected losses on unfunded loan commitments. The provision for credit losses - loans and loan commitments decreased to 4.8 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to a provision of 6.3 million in the third quarter of 2023. The 4.8 million provision in the third quarter of 2024 was a result of continued loan growth and adjustments in regional macroeconomic factors and loan concentrations as well as an increase in net charge-offs and was partially offset by a reduction in the reserve for individually evaluated loans. Non-performing loans were 0.24 of total portfolio loans as of September 30, 2024, decreasing from 0.26 of total portfolio loans at the end of the third quarter of 2023. Criticized and classified loans were 2.36 of total portfolio loans as of September 30, 2024, increasing from 2.22 as of September 30, 2023, due to downgrades within the loan portfolio. Past due loans at September 30, 2024 were 0.44 of total portfolio loans, compared to 0.22 at September 30, 2023. Annualized net loan charge-offs were 0.11 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.03 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Please see the Allowance for Credit Losses Loans and Loan Commitments section of this MD A for additional discussion.

NM = Not Meaningful 
 Non-interest income is a significant source of revenue and an important part of Wesbanco s results of operations, as it represents 19.6 of total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Wesbanco offers its customers a wide range of retail, commercial, investment and digital banking services, which are viewed as a vital component of Wesbanco s ability to attract and maintain customers, as well as providing additional fee income beyond normal spread-related income to Wesbanco. For the third quarter of 2024, non-interest income decreased 1.3 million or 4.1 compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to a 4.5 million decrease in net swap fee and valuation income. This was partially offset by a 1.2 million increase in service charges on deposits, a 1.0 million increase in net securities gains, a 0.8 million increase in trust fees, and a 0.3 million increase in mortgage banking income. 
 Trust fees increased 0.8 million or 12.1 compared to the third quarter of 2023, due to an increase in the market value of trust assets. Total trust assets were 6.1 billion as of September 30, 2024 as compared to 5.0 billion at September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, trust assets include managed assets of 5.0 billion and non-managed (custodial) assets of 1.1 billion. Assets managed for the WesMark Funds, a proprietary group of mutual funds that is advised by Wesbanco Trust and Investment Services, were 0.9 billion and 0.8 billion as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, and are included in managed assets. Trust fees increased 1.8 million or 8.5 in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023 for similar reasons as that for the three months ended. 
 Service charges on deposits increased 1.2 million or 18.1 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, due to an increase in transactional fee income, treasury management fee income and increased general consumer spending. Service charges on deposits increased 2.7 million or 14.2 in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 for similar reasons as that for the three months ended. 
 Net swap fee and valuation income, which includes fair value adjustments, decreased 4.5 million or 116.3 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, due to a decrease in swap fee income and fair value adjustments on existing swaps. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, new swaps executed of 71.8 million in notional principal resulted in 1.1 million of fee income as compared to new swaps executed of 178.1 million in notional principal, resulting in 2.5 million of fee income for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Fair value adjustments on existing swaps for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were negative 1.7 million as compared to positive 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the first nine months of 2024, net swap fee and valuation income decreased by 4.5 million or 62.6 from the first nine months of 2023. During this time period, new swap fee income decreased by 3.1 million along with a 1.4 million decrease in fair value adjustments on existing swaps. 
 Net securities gains include both gains and losses on investment security transactions as well as market value adjustments on Wesbanco's deferred compensation plan. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net securities gains increased 1.0 million compared to the same period in 2023, due to a 0.6 million increase in market adjustments on the deferred compensation plan in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to a 0.2 million decrease in market adjustments in the third quarter of 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net securities gains increased by 1.3 million from the nine months of 2023 for the same reasons. 
 Mortgage banking income increased 0.3 million or 31.3 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, due to an increase in sale margins, partially offset by a decrease in fair value adjustments on mortgage derivatives. For the third quarter of 2024, total mortgage production was 167.2 million, which increased by 1.0 from the third quarter of 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, 84.9 million in mortgages were sold into the secondary market as compared to 90.3 million in the comparable 2023 period. Included in mortgage banking income above are a loss of 0.6 million and a gain of 0.6 million from the fair value adjustments on mortgage loan commitments and related derivatives for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Mortgage banking income increased by 1.0 million or 52.0 from the first nine months of 2023 to the first nine months of 2024 for similar reasons as that for the three months ended.

Non-interest expense in the third quarter of 2024 increased 3.2 million or 3.3 as compared to the same quarter in 2023, principally from a 1.3 million increase in restructuring and merger-related expenses, a 1.0 million increase in supplies, postage and other operating expense, and a 1.0 million increase in equipment and software expense. These increases were partially offset by a 0.5 million decrease in salaries and wages and a 0.4 million decrease in employee benefits. 
 Salaries and wages decreased 0.5 million or 1.0 in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023 due to lower staffing levels associated with efficiency improvements in the mortgage and branch staffing models and were partially offset by normal compensation merit adjustments. The average full time equivalent employees decreased by 6.2 from the third quarter of 2023 to the third quarter of 2024 due to the elimination of certain branch staffing, residential lending and related back-office positions. Salaries and wages were flat in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023. 
 Employee benefits expense decreased by 0.4 million or 3.4 in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a 0.7 million decrease in other benefits expenses and a 0.5 million decrease in health insurance driven by lower staffing levels. This is partially offset by an increase in deferred compensation expense. Similarly, employee benefits expense decreased 1.2 million or 3.4 in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023. 
 Equipment and software costs increased 1.0 million or 11.2 in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023, due primarily to continued improvements made in automating and enhancing processes, along with the upgrade of Wesbanco s ATM fleet with newer technology, which occurred throughout 2023. Similarly, equipment and software costs increased 3.6 million or 13.3 in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023. 
 Restructuring and merger-related expenses increased 1.3 million in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023, due to merger-related expenses incurred for the potential acquisition of Premier Financial. Similarly, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, restructuring and merger-related expenses increased 1.9 million from the same period in 2023. 
 Professional fees increased by 0.6 million or 15.1 in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023, due to increased loan origination fees resulting from an increase in loan volume, increased legal fees and higher other professional fees. Similarly, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, professional fees increased 2.9 million or 25.8 from the same period in 2023. 
 Supplies, postage and other operating expense increased by 1.0 million or 16.8 in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to higher costs and fees in support of loan growth and other miscellaneous expenses. Similarly, supplies, postage and other expense increased 2.9 million or 14.5 in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. 
 42 

INCOME TAXES 
 The provision for income taxes was 7.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which is flat compared to the provision for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The unchanged provision for income taxes is due to a 0.5 million increase in pre-tax income over the same time period, while the effective tax rate decreased slightly from 17.4 to 16.8 for the quarter. The provision for income taxes was 21.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which is a 5.2 million decrease compared to the provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as pre-tax income decreased by 27.3 million over the same time period. 
 
 FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 Total assets increased 4.5 , while shareholders' equity increased 10.6 at September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023. Total securities decreased 1.9 million or 0.1 from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024, as investment runoff was reinvested in new securities. Total portfolio loans were 12.5 billion, which increased 0.8 billion or 7.0 since December 31, 2023 driven by strong performance from our commercial and residential lending teams. Deposits increased 0.7 billion, or 5.1 from December 31, 2023, reflecting the benefit of deposit gathering and retention efforts by our retail and commercial teams. The composition of total deposits continues to have some mix shift; however, total demand deposits continue to represent 54 of total deposits, with the non-interest bearing component representing 27 , which remains consistent with the percentage range prior to the pandemic. The overall decrease in transaction-based accounts is primarily attributable to customers' preferences as deposit rates have risen in the current market environment. Deposits were also somewhat impacted by bonus and royalty payments for Marcellus and Utica shale gas payments from energy companies in Wesbanco s southwestern Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio, and northern West Virginia markets. Total FHLB borrowings decreased 175.0 million or 13.0 during the first nine months of 2024, as proceeds were used from the 200 million of common equity raised in the third quarter to pay down borrowings. Shareholders' equity increased 268.5 million or 10.6 from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024, primarily due to the capital raise, increases in other comprehensive income, and net income exceeding dividends declared for the period.

(1) At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no holdings of any one issuer, other than U.S. government sponsored entities and its agencies, in an amount greater than 10 of Wesbanco s shareholders equity. 

(2) Weighted average yields have been calculated on a taxable-equivalent basis using the federal statutory tax rate of 21 . 

Total investment securities, which are a source of liquidity for Wesbanco as well as a contributor to interest income, decreased by 1.9 million or 0.1 from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. Through the first nine months of the year, the available-for-sale portfolio increased by 34.2 million or 1.6 , primarily due to 213.4 million in purchases and a decrease of 58.6 million in unrealized losses, partially offset by 198.0 million in paydowns and 37.0 million in maturities and calls. The held-to-maturity portfolio decreased by 37.2 million or 3.1 due primarily to maturities and calls of municipal securities. The weighted average yield of the portfolio increased 12 basis points from 2.52 at December 31, 2023 to 2.64 at September 30, 2024, primarily due to new investment purchases at higher rates and increases in the indices tied to variable rate securities. 
 Total gross unrealized securities losses decreased 78.8 million from 438.3 million at December 31, 2023 to 359.5 million at September 30, 2024. The decrease in unrealized losses from December 31, 2023 was due to a decrease in market rates in 2024 to date, causing market prices to increase. Wesbanco believes that none of the unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities at September 30, 2024 require an allowance for credit losses. Please refer to Note 4, Securities, of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Wesbanco does not have any investments in private mortgage-backed securities or those that are collateralized by sub-prime mortgages, nor does Wesbanco have any exposure to collateralized debt obligations or government-sponsored enterprise preferred stocks. 
 Net unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities included in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were 188.1 million and 233.2 million, respectively. These net unrealized pre-tax losses represent temporary fluctuations resulting from changes in market rates in relation to fixed yields in the available-for-sale portfolio, and on an after-tax basis are accounted for as an adjustment to other comprehensive income in shareholders equity. Net unrealized pre-tax losses in the held-to-maturity portfolio, which are not accounted for in other comprehensive income, were 109.6 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 130.4 million at December 31, 2023. With approximately 34 of the investment portfolio in the held-to-maturity category, the recent volatility in interest rates does not have as much impact on other comprehensive income as if the entire portfolio were included in the available-for-sale category. 
 44 

Equity securities, of which a portion consists of investments in various mutual funds held in grantor trusts formed in connection with a key officer and director deferred compensation plan, are recorded at fair value. Gains and losses due to fair value fluctuations on equity securities are included in net securities gains or losses. For those equity securities relating to the key officer and director deferred compensation plan, the corresponding change in the obligation to the employee is recognized in employee benefits expense. 
 
 The corporate and municipal bonds in Wesbanco s held-to-maturity debt portfolio are analyzed quarterly to determine if an allowance for current expected credit losses is warranted. Wesbanco uses a database of historical financials of all corporate and municipal issuers and actual historic default and recovery rates on rated and non-rated transactions to estimate expected credit losses on an individual security basis. The expected credit losses are adjusted quarterly and are recorded in an allowance for expected credit losses on the balance sheet, which is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the held-to-maturity portfolio as a contra asset. The losses are recorded on the consolidated income statement in the provision for credit losses. Accrued interest receivable on held-to-maturity securities, which was 8.4 million and 8.8 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. Held-to-maturity investments in U.S. Government sponsored entities and agencies as well as mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, which are all either issued by a direct governmental entity or a government-sponsored entity, have no historical evidence supporting expected credit losses; therefore, Wesbanco has estimated these losses at zero, and will monitor this assumption in the future for any economic or governmental policies that could affect this assumption. 
 
 Wesbanco uses prices from independent pricing services and, to a lesser extent, indicative (non-binding) quotes from independent brokers, to measure the fair value of its securities. Wesbanco validates prices received from pricing services or brokers using a variety of methods, including, but not limited to, comparison to secondary pricing services, corroboration of pricing by reference to other independent market data such as secondary broker quotes and relevant benchmark indices, review of pricing by personnel familiar with market liquidity and other market-related conditions, review of pricing service methodologies, review of independent auditor reports received from the pricing service regarding its internal controls, and through review of inputs and assumptions used in pricing certain securities thinly traded or with limited observable data points. The procedures in place provide management with a sufficient understanding of the valuation models, assumptions, inputs and pricing to reasonably measure the fair value of Wesbanco s securities. For additional disclosure relating to fair value measurements, refer to Note 9, Fair Value Measurement in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 45 

LOANS AND CREDIT RISK 
 Loans represent Wesbanco s single largest balance sheet asset classification and the largest source of interest income. Business purpose loans consist of CRE loans and other C I loans that are not secured by real estate. CRE loans are further segmented into land and construction loans, and loans for improved property. Consumer purpose loans consist of residential real estate loans, home equity lines of credit and other consumer loans. Loans held for sale generally consist of residential real estate loans originated for sale in the secondary market, but at times may also include other types of loans. The outstanding balance of each major category of the loan portfolio is summarized in Table 7. 
 The risk that borrowers will be unable or unwilling to repay their obligations and default on loans is inherent in all lending activities. Credit risk arises from many sources including general economic conditions, external events that impact businesses or industries, isolated events that impact a major employer, individual loss of employment or other personal hardships, as well as changes in interest rates or the value of collateral. Credit risk is also impacted by a concentration of exposure within a geographic market or to one or more borrowers, industries or collateral types. The primary goal in managing credit risk is to minimize the impact of default by an individual borrower or group of borrowers. Credit risk is managed through the initial underwriting process as well as through ongoing monitoring and administration of the portfolio that varies by the type of loan. The Bank s credit policies establish standard underwriting guidelines for each type of loan and require an appropriate evaluation of the credit characteristics of each borrower. This evaluation includes the borrower s primary source of repayment capacity; the adequacy of collateral, if any, to secure the loan; the potential value of personal guarantees as secondary sources of repayment; and other factors unique to each loan that may increase or mitigate its risk. Credit bureau scores are also considered when evaluating consumer purpose loans as well as guarantors of business purpose loans. However, the Bank does not periodically update credit bureau scores subsequent to when loans are made to determine changes in credit history. 
 Credit risk is mitigated for all types of loans by continuously monitoring delinquency levels and pursuing collection efforts at the earliest stage of delinquency. The Bank also monitors general economic conditions, including employment, housing activity and real estate values in its market. The Bank also periodically evaluates and changes its underwriting standards when warranted based on market conditions, the historical performance of a category of the portfolio, or other external factors. Credit risk is also regularly evaluated for the impact of adverse economic and other events that increase the risk of default and the potential loss in the event of default, to understand the impact on the Bank s earnings and capital. 
 Commercial loan risk grades are determined based on an evaluation of the relevant characteristics of each loan, assigned at inception and adjusted thereafter at any time to reflect changes in the risk profile throughout the life of each loan. The primary factors used to determine the risk grade are the sufficiency, reliability and sustainability of the primary source of repayment and overall financial strength of the borrower. The rating system more heavily weights the debt service coverage, leverage and loan-to-value factors to derive the risk grade. Other factors that are considered at a lesser weighting include management, industry or property-type risks, payment history, collateral and personal guarantees.

Total portfolio loans increased 0.8 billion or 7.0 from December 31, 2023, and have increased 1.1 billion or 10.0 over the past twelve months. The increase over the last twelve months was driven by a 36.8 growth in land and construction loans due to increased originations. Originations have outpaced repayments in several loan categories, leading to increases of 11.4 in home equity loans, 9.0 in improved property loans, 8.2 in commercial and industrial loans, and 5.3 in residential real estate. Consumer loans have decreased somewhat at 9.1 . 
 
 Total loan commitments of 4.9 billion, including loans approved but not closed, increased 0.2 billion or 3.7 from December 31, 2023 due primarily to increased lines of credit. The average line utilization percentage for the commercial portfolio was 35.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 31.9 for the three months ended December 31, 2023. 
 The commercial portfolio is monitored for potential concentrations of credit risk by market, type of lending, CRE property type, C I and owner-occupied CRE by industry, investment CRE dependence on common tenants and industries or property types that are similarly impacted by external factors. The breakdown for all CRE improved property is 25 owner-occupied and 75 investor-owned. The bank has instituted additional monitoring of the office building portfolio, as remote work has put pressure on the need for dedicated office space in certain markets. The office portfolio breakdown within CRE improved property is 33 owner-occupied and 67 investor-owned. Investor-owned office buildings represent 3.7 of the total loan portfolio. 
 46 

Loans held for sale at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are originated residential mortgages that are committed to be sold into the secondary market. Loans held for sale increased by 5.8 million or 35.3 from December 31, 2023 due to increased originations in the second and third quarters of 2024, as compared to those in the fourth quarter of 2023. 

NON-PERFORMING ASSETS AND LOANS PAST DUE 90 DAYS OR MORE 
 Non-performing assets consist of non-accrual loans, other real estate acquired through or in lieu of foreclosure, bank premises held for sale, and repossessed automobiles acquired to satisfy defaulted consumer loans.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES - LOANS AND LOAN COMMITMENTS 
 As of September 30, 2024, the total allowance for credit losses loans and commitments was 149.1 million, of which 140.9 million related to loans and 8.2 million related to loan commitments. The allowance for credit losses loans was 1.13 of total portfolio loans as of September 30, 2024, compared to 1.12 as of December 31, 2023. Excluded from the allowance for credit losses and related coverage ratio are fair market value adjustments on previously acquired loans representing 0.09 of total portfolio loans at September 30, 2024. The allowance for credit losses loans individually-evaluated increased 2.2 million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. The population of individually-evaluated loans consisted of seven loans, with a total outstanding loan balance of 38.5 million. The allowance for loans collectively-evaluated increased from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 by 8.0 million. The allowance for credit losses- loan commitments was 8.2 million at September 30, 2024 as compared to 8.6 million as of December 31, 2023, and is included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 The allowance for credit losses by loan category, presented in Note 5, Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses of the Consolidated Financial Statements, summarizes the impact of changes in various factors that affect the allowance for loan losses in each segment of the portfolio. The allowance for credit losses under CECL is calculated utilizing the probability of default PD divided by the loss given default LGD ), which is then discounted to net present value. PD is the probability the asset will default within a given time frame and LGD is the percentage of the asset not expected to be collected due to default. The primary macroeconomic drivers of the quantitative model include forecasts of national unemployment and interest rates, as well as modeling adjustments for changes in prepayment speeds, loan risk grades, portfolio mix, concentrations and loan growth. For the calculation as of September 30, 2024, the forecast was based upon a probability weighted approach which is designed to incorporate loss projections from a baseline, upside and downside economy. Due to the nonlinearity of credit losses to the economy, the asymmetry is best captured by evaluating multiple economic scenarios through a probability weighted approach. At quarter-end, national unemployment was projected to be 4.6 , and subsequently increase to an average of 5.0 over the remainder of the forecast period. Quarterly changes to the economic drivers of the quantitative model, including changes to the portfolio mix as well as an increase in the bank s qualitative adjustments caused the allowance for credit losses - loans to increase from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 by 10.2 million. 
 Criticized and classified loans were 2.36 of total portfolio loans, or 293.7 million, at September 30, 2024, increasing from 2.22 of total portfolio loans at December 31, 2023. See Note 5, Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses for more information.

Although the allowance for credit losses is allocated as described in Table 10, the total allowance is available to absorb actual losses in any category of the loan portfolio. However, differences between management s estimation of probable losses and actual net charge-offs in subsequent periods for any category may necessitate future adjustments to the allowance for credit losses applicable to the category. Management believes the allowance for credit losses is appropriate to absorb expected losses at September 30, 2024.

Deposits, which represent Wesbanco s primary source of funds, are offered in various account forms at various rates through Wesbanco s 192 financial centers. The FDIC insures deposits up to 250,000 per account owner. 
 
 Total deposits increased 668.6 million or 5.1 during the first nine months of 2024. Money market deposit accounts and demand deposits increased 16.3 and 0.3 , respectively, which were partially offset by savings deposits decreasing 4.5 . The net increase in deposits reflects the benefit of deposit gathering and retention efforts by both retail and commercial teams. The composition of total deposits continues to have a shift in the mix, however, demand deposits as a percentage of total deposits at September 30, 2024 remains consistent with the percentage range pre-pandemic. Deposit balances were also impacted by bonus and royalty payments for Marcellus and Utica shale gas payments from energy companies in Wesbanco s southwestern Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio and northern West Virginia markets. In addition, Wesbanco also participates in the Insured Cash Sweep (ICS deposit program. ICS reciprocal balances totaled 1.2 billion and 1.0 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In addition, ICS one-way buys totaled 200.6 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 Certificates of deposit increased 35.1 from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. Wesbanco does not generally solicit brokered or other deposits out-of-market or over the internet but does participate in the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Services (CDARS program. CDARS balances totaled 55.9 million in outstanding balances at September 30, 2024, of which 10.0 million represented one-way buys, compared to 48.4 million in total outstanding balances, of which 10.6 million represented one-way buys, at December 31, 2023. Certificates of deposit greater than 250,000 were approximately 396.4 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 223.4 million at December 31, 2023. Certificates of deposit totaling approximately 1.5 billion at September 30, 2024 with a cost of 4.17 are scheduled to mature within the next 12 months. From time to time, the Bank may offer special promotions or match competitor rates on certain certificates of deposit maturities and savings products based on competition, sales strategies, liquidity needs and wholesale borrowing costs.

While borrowings are a significant source of funding for Wesbanco, they are less significant as compared to total deposits. FHLB borrowings decreased 175.0 million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024, as 1.2 billion in new advances were partially offset by 1.4 billion in maturities, as the proceeds from the 200 million capital raise in the third quarter of 2024 were used to pay down FHLB borrowings. The average cost of maturing FHLB advances for the first nine months of 2024 was 5.64 while the average cost of new borrowings was 5.59 . 
 
 Other short-term borrowings, which may consist of federal funds purchased, repurchase agreements and overnight sweep checking accounts were 140.6 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 105.9 million at December 31, 2023. There were no outstanding federal funds purchased at either September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 49 

CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Shareholders' equity increased 268.5 million or 10.6 from December 31, 2023, to 2.8 billion at September 30, 2024. The increase resulted primarily from a private placement of Wesbanco common shares that closed on August 1, 2024. The proceeds net of offering expenses totaled 191.0 million which were used to support the proposed merger of Wesbanco and Premier, to pay down borrowings and for general corporate purposes. Additionally, the increase resulted from net income during the current nine-month period of 101.9 million, exceeding the declaration of common and preferred shareholder dividends totaling 66.2 million and 7.6 million, respectively, coupled with a 44.9 million other comprehensive gain for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Wesbanco also increased its quarterly dividend rate 0.01 per quarter to 0.36 per share in November 2023, representing a 2.9 increase over the prior quarterly rate and a cumulative 157 increase since 2010. 
 
 Wesbanco did not purchase any shares of its common stock on the open market during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 under the current share repurchase authorization. At September 30, 2024, the remaining shares authorized to be purchased under the last approved repurchase plan totaled 972,298 shares. 
 
 Regulatory guidelines require bank holding companies and commercial banks to maintain certain minimum capital ratios and define companies as well capitalized that sufficiently exceed the minimum ratios. At September 30, 2024, regulatory capital levels for both the Bank and Wesbanco were substantially greater than the minimum amounts needed to be considered well capitalized under the regulations. There are various legal limitations under federal and state laws that limit the payment of dividends from the Bank to Wesbanco. As of September 30, 2024, under FDIC regulations, Wesbanco could receive, without prior regulatory approval, a dividend of approximately 194.7 million from the Bank. 
 
 On March 26, 2020, regulators issued interim financial rule IFR Regulatory Capital Rule: Revised Transition of the Current Expected Losses Methodology for Allowances in response to the disrupted economic activity from the spread of COVID-19. The IFR provides financial institutions that adopt CECL during 2020 with the option to delay for two years the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of the capital benefit provided by the initial two-year delay five-year transition ). Wesbanco adopted CECL effective January 1, 2020 and elected to implement the five-year transition. Regulatory capital levels without the capital benefit at September 30, 2024 for both the Bank and Wesbanco would have continued to be greater than the amounts needed to be considered well capitalized, as the capital benefit approximated five to seven basis points for three of the four regulatory ratios, while total risk-based capital would have been slightly higher without the transition.

LIQUIDITY RISK 
 Liquidity is defined as a financial institution s capacity to meet its cash and collateral obligations at a reasonable cost. Liquidity risk is the risk that an institution s financial condition or overall safety and soundness is adversely affected by an inability, or perceived inability, to meet its obligations. An institution s obligations, and the funding sources to meet them, depend significantly on its business mix, balance sheet structure, and the cash flows of its on- and off-balance sheet obligations. Institutions confront various internal and external situations that can give rise to increased liquidity risk including funding mismatches, market constraints on funding sources, contingent liquidity events, changes in economic conditions, and exposure to credit, market, operation, legal and reputation risk. Wesbanco actively manages liquidity risk through its ability to provide adequate funds to meet changes in loan demand, unexpected outflows in deposits and other borrowings as well as to take advantage of market opportunities and meet operating cash needs. This is accomplished by maintaining liquid assets in the form of securities, sufficient borrowing capacity and a stable core deposit base. Liquidity is centrally monitored by Wesbanco s Asset/Liability Committee ALCO with direct oversight from the Board of Directors ("BOD"). 
 Wesbanco determines the degree of required liquidity by the relationship of total holdings of liquid assets to potential funding needs to meet unexpected deposit losses and/or loan demands. The ability to quickly convert assets to cash at a minimal loss is a primary function of managing Wesbanco s investment portfolio. Wesbanco believes its cash flow from the loan portfolio, the investment portfolio, and other sources, adequately meet its liquidity requirements. Wesbanco s net loans to assets ratio was 66.5 at September 30, 2024 and deposit balances funded 74.7 of assets.

(1) Projected prepayments are based on current prepayment speeds. 

Deposit cash flows are another principal factor affecting overall Wesbanco liquidity. Deposits totaled 13.8 billion at September 30, 2024. Deposit cash flows are impacted by current interest rates, products and rates offered by Wesbanco versus various forms of competition, as well as customer behavior. Certificates of deposit scheduled to mature within one year totaled 1.5 billion at September 30, 2024, with a weighted average cost of 4.17 , which includes jumbo regular certificates of deposit totaling 843.0 million with a weighted-average cost of 4.51 , and jumbo CDARS certificates of deposit of 51.2 million with a weighted-average cost of 4.20 . Wesbanco had 10.0 million brokered one-way buys at September 30, 2024. 
 Uninsured deposits, as reported for regulatory purposes, totaled 4.6 billion at September 30, 2024, or 33 of total deposits. Uninsured deposits include 1.6 billion of public funds deposits that are over the FDIC-insured limit. Wesbanco secures these public funds deposits by pledging investment securities with a market value at or above the deposit balance. Excluding these public funds, at September 30, 2024, uninsured deposits were 3.0 billion, or 22 of total deposits. 
 Wesbanco maintains a line of credit with the FHLB as an additional funding source. Available credit with the FHLB approximated 3.6 billion and 3.4 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The FHLB requires securities to be specifically pledged to the FHLB and maintained in a FHLB-approved custodial arrangement if the member wishes to include such securities in the maximum borrowing capacity calculation. Wesbanco has elected not to specifically pledge to the FHLB unpledged securities. Wesbanco can also use this line of credit for pledging collateral to cover public funds deposits, as an alternative to pledging securities from the investment portfolio. At September 30, 2024, the Bank had unpledged available-for-sale securities with an estimated fair value of 261.9 million, or 12.0 of the total available-for-sale portfolio. A portion of these securities could be sold for additional liquidity, or such securities could be pledged to secure additional FHLB borrowings. Approximately 63 of the portfolio is pledged to public deposit customers, as public deposit balances have increased significantly through the several acquisitions made since 2015. As a result of this growth, Wesbanco is monitoring exposure to public funds deposits in relation to pledging requirements and providing insured cash sweep ("ICS") deposits via IntraFi as a solution for a portion of new and existing public fund depositors. In addition, at September 30, 2024, the Bank had unpledged held-to-maturity securities with an estimated fair value of 762.6 million. Approximately 96 , or 735.1 million of these securities are municipal securities, which can only be pledged in limited circumstances. Generally, these securities cannot be sold without tainting the remainder of the held-to-maturity portfolio. If tainting occurs, all remaining securities with the held-to-maturity designation would be required to be reclassified as available-for-sale, and the held-to-maturity designation would not be available to Wesbanco for a period of time. 
 Wesbanco participates in the Federal Reserve Bank s Borrower-in-Custody Program BIC whereby Wesbanco pledges certain consumer loans as collateral for borrowings. Wesbanco did not have any BIC borrowings outstanding at September 30, 2024. Alternative funding sources may include the utilization of existing overnight lines of credit with third party banks totaling 235.0 million, none of which was outstanding at September 30, 2024, along with seeking other lines of credit, borrowings under repurchase agreement lines, increasing deposit rates to attract additional funds, accessing brokered deposits, or selling securities available-for-sale or certain types of loans. 
 Other short-term borrowings of 140.6 million at September 30, 2024 consisted of repurchase agreements or overnight sweep checking accounts for large commercial customers. Other short-term borrowings may also include federal funds purchased using the Federal Reserve's discount window or lines of credit with third party banks noted above. The overnight sweep checking accounts require U.S. Government securities to be pledged equal to or greater than the average deposit balance in the related customer accounts. 
 51 

The principal sources of parent company liquidity are dividends from the Bank and 401.9 million in cash on hand. There are various legal limitations under federal and state laws that limit the payment of dividends from the Bank to the parent company. As of September 30, 2024, under FDIC and State of West Virginia regulations, Wesbanco could receive, without prior regulatory approval, dividends of approximately 194.7 million from the Bank. Management believes these are appropriate levels of cash for the parent company given the current environment. Management continuously monitors the adequacy of parent company cash levels and sources of liquidity through the use of metrics that relate current cash levels to historical and forecasted cash inflows and outflows. 
 Wesbanco had outstanding commitments to extend credit in the ordinary course of business approximating 4.9 billion and 4.7 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. On a historical basis, only a portion of these commitments will result in an outflow of funds. Please refer to Note 12, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Loans and Credit Risk section of this MD A for additional information. 
 Federal financial regulatory agencies have previously issued guidance to provide for sound practices for managing funding and liquidity risk and strengthening liquidity risk management practices. Wesbanco maintains a comprehensive management process for identifying, measuring, monitoring, and controlling liquidity risk, which is fully integrated into its risk management process. Management believes Wesbanco has sufficient current liquidity to meet current obligations to borrowers, depositors and others and that Wesbanco s current liquidity risk management policies and procedures, as periodically reviewed and adjusted, adequately address this guidance.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATI VE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 The disclosures set forth in this item are qualified by the section captioned Forward-Looking Statements included in Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report. 
 MARKET RISK 
 The primary objective of Wesbanco s ALCO with direct oversight from the BOD is to maximize net interest income within established policy parameters. This objective is accomplished through the management of balance sheet composition and duration, market risk exposures arising from changing economic conditions as well as liquidity risk. 
 
 Market risk is defined as the risk of loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments resulting from fluctuations in interest rates and bond prices. Management considers interest rate risk to be Wesbanco s most significant market risk. Interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in net interest income due to changes in interest rates. The consistency of Wesbanco s net interest income is largely dependent on effective management of Wesbanco's interest rate risk profile. As interest rates change in the market, rates earned on interest rate-sensitive assets and rates paid on interest rate-sensitive liabilities do not necessarily move concurrently. Differing rate sensitivities may arise because fixed rate assets and liabilities may not have the same maturities, because variable rate assets and liabilities differ in the timing and/or the magnitude of rate changes, or due to the shape of the yield curve shifting over time. 
 
 Wesbanco s ALCO is an executive management committee with Board representation, responsible for monitoring and managing interest rate risk within approved policy limits, utilizing earnings sensitivity simulation ("NII") and economic value of equity ("EVE") models. These models are highly dependent on various assumptions, which change regularly as the balance sheet composition and market interest rates change. The key assumptions and strategies employed are analyzed, reviewed and documented at least quarterly by the ALCO as well as provided to the Board. 
 
 The earnings sensitivity simulation model projects changes in net interest income resulting from the effects of changes in interest rates. Forecasting changes in net interest income requires management to make certain assumptions regarding loan and security prepayment rates, call dates, changes to deposit product betas and non-maturity deposit decay rates, which may not necessarily reflect the manner in which actual cash flows, yields, and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. Assumptions are based on internally-developed models derived from institution specific data, current market rates and economic forecasts, and are internally back-tested and periodically reviewed by an independent third-party consultant. Key assumptions are reviewed quarterly and updated as deemed appropriate by management. No material assumption changes were made by management this period. The net interest income sensitivity results presented in Table 1, Net Interest Income Sensitivity, assumes that the balance sheet composition of interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the end of the period remains constant over the period being measured (otherwise known as a "static" balance sheet) and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected immediately and parallel across all tenors of the yield curve, regardless of the duration of the maturity or re-pricing of specific assets and liabilities. Since the assumptions used in the model relative to changes in interest rates are uncertain, the simulation analysis may not be indicative of actual results, particularly in times of stress. In addition, this analysis does not consider actions that management might employ in the future in response to changes in interest rates, as well as changes in earning asset and costing liability balances. 
 
 Interest rate risk policy limits are determined by measuring the anticipated change in net interest income over a twelve-month period, assuming immediate and sustained market interest rate increases and decreases of 100 - 400 basis points across the entire yield curve, as compared to a flat rate environment or base model. Wesbanco s current policy limits this exposure for the noted interest rate changes to a reduction of between 7.5 - 20 , or less, of net interest income from the stable rate base model over a twelve-month period. The table below indicates Wesbanco s interest rate sensitivity at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, assuming the above-noted interest rate changes, as compared to a base model.

Net interest income sensitivity changes are due to the impact of the current rate and yield curve environment on base case net interest income and the related calculation of immediate parallel rate shock changes in rising and falling rate scenarios. Additional differences typically result from changes in the various earning assets and costing liabilities mix and growth rates, as well as periodic updates of various modeling assumptions. Generally, weighted average interest bearing non-maturity deposit betas utilized in modeling are 40 in up shocks and 30 in down shocks as the banking industry continues to remain in a high interest rate environment where funding cost pressures have persisted. Deposit betas, decay rates and loan prepayment speeds are adjusted periodically, but no less than annually in our models for non-maturity deposits and loans. Indicated model asset sensitivity in rising rate scenarios may be less than anticipated due to slower prepayment speeds, rate floors, below forecast loan yields, spread compression between new asset yields and funding costs, customer requests for negotiated rates, mortgage-related extension risk and other factors. In a decreasing rate environment, asset sensitivity may have greater impact on the margin than currently modeled as prepayment speeds increase, customers refinance or request rate reductions on existing loans, estimated deposit betas do not perform as modeled, or for other reasons not listed. 
 53 

In addition to the aforementioned parallel rate shock earnings sensitivity simulation model, the ALCO also reviews a dynamic forecast scenario to project Wesbanco's "most likely" net interest income over a rolling two-year time period. This forecast is updated at least quarterly, incorporating revisions and updated assumptions into the model for estimated loan and deposit growth, expected balance sheet re-mixing strategies, changes in forecasted interest rates for various indices and yield curves, competitive market spreads for various products and other assumptions not listed. Such modeling is directionally consistent with typical parallel rate shock scenarios, and it assists in predicting changes in forecasted outcomes and potential adjustments to management plans to assist in achieving earnings goals. 
 Wesbanco also periodically measures the EVE, which is defined as the market value of tangible equity in various rate scenarios. Generally, changes in the EVE relate to changes in various assets and liabilities, changes in the yield curve, as well as changes in loan prepayment speeds and deposit decay rates. The following table presents these results and Wesbanco s policy limits as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Changes in EVE sensitivity since year-end 2023 relate to the change in market interest rates and their impact upon the fair values of earning assets and costing liabilities.

The Bank has significant additional borrowing capacity with the FHLB of Pittsburgh, the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and various correspondent banks, and may utilize these funding sources or interest rate swap strategies as necessary to lengthen liabilities, offset mismatches in various asset maturities and manage liquidity. CDARS and ICS deposits also may be utilized for similar purposes for certain customers seeking higher-yielding instruments or maintaining deposit levels below FDIC insurance limits. Significant balance sheet strategies to assist in managing the net interest margin in the current interest rate environment include: 

increasing total loans, particularly commercial and home equity loans that have variable or adjustable features; 

adjusting the percentage of sales of longer-term residential mortgage loan production into the secondary market; 

managing rates on interest bearing deposits and growing demand deposit account types to increase the relative portion of these account types to total deposits; 

employing back-to-back loan swaps for certain commercial loan customers desiring a term fixed rate loan equivalent, with the Bank receiving a variable rate; 

adjusting terms for FHLB short-term maturing borrowings to balance asset/liability mismatches; or paying them off with excess liquidity 

using CDARS and ICS deposit programs to manage funding needs and overall liability mix, and 

adjusting the size, mix or duration of the investment portfolio as part of liquidity and balance sheet management strategies. 

54 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Wesbanco s Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO have concluded that Wesbanco s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), based on their evaluation of these controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Wesbanco in the reports it files under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Wesbanco s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 LIMITATIONS ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTROLS Wesbanco s management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that Wesbanco s disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. While Wesbanco s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objective, no control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. 
 CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS There were no changes in Wesbanco's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 as required to be reported by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
 55 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 Wesbanco is involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of business. While any litigation contains an element of uncertainty, Wesbanco does not believe that a material loss related to such proceedings or claims pending or known to be threatened is reasonably possible. 
 ITE M 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 In light of its entrance into the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, Wesbanco is supplementing its risk factors contained in Item 1A of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 26, 2024 Annual Report ). The following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the risk factors contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the risks described in our Annual Report, as well as any of the risks described below, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we deem immaterial may also adversely impact our business or financial results. Except as set forth below, there are no material changes related to risk factors from the risk factors described in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Risks Relating to the Merger 
 Although we expect that our pending acquisition of Premier will result in cost savings, synergies and other benefits, the combined company may not realize those benefits because of integration difficulties and other challenges. 
 The success of our acquisition of Premier Financial will depend in large part on the success of the management of the combined company in integrating the operations, strategies, technologies and personnel of the two companies following the completion of the Merger. The combined company may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the Merger if the integration process takes longer than expected or is more costly than expected. The failure of the combined company to meet the challenges involved in successfully integrating the operations of the two companies or to otherwise realize any of the anticipated benefits of the Merger, including additional cost savings and synergies, could impair the operations of the combined company. In addition, we anticipate that the overall integration of Premier Financial will be a time-consuming and expensive process that, without proper planning and effective and timely implementation, could significantly disrupt the combined company s business. 
 Potential difficulties the combined company may encounter in the integration process include the following: 
 the integration of management teams, strategies, technologies and operations, products and services; 

the disruption of ongoing businesses and distraction of their respective management teams from ongoing business concerns; 

the retention of and possible decrease in business from the existing customers of both companies; 

the creation of uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems; 

the reduction of the costs associated with each company s operations; 

the integration of corporate cultures and maintenance of employee morale; 

the retention of key employees; and 

potential unknown liabilities associated with the Merger. 

The anticipated cost savings, synergies and other benefits of the Merger assume a successful integration of the companies and are based on projections and other assumptions, which are inherently uncertain. Even if integration is successful, anticipated cost savings, synergies and other benefits may not be achieved. 
 We have incurred, and will incur, significant transaction-related costs in connection with the Merger. 
 We have incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, as well as the costs and expenses of filing, printing and mailing a joint proxy statement/prospectus, and filing and other fees to be paid to the SEC and other regulatory agencies in connection with the Merger. These fees and costs will be significant. In addition, we will incur significant costs with respect to the issuance and sale of shares of our common stock to investors in a private placement (the Private Placement pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement that is related to the Merger. If the Merger is not completed, we may have to recognize these expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the Merger. 
 In addition, we also expect to incur a number of non-recurring transaction-related costs associated with combining the operations of the two companies and achieving desired synergies. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our business with the business of Premier Financial. There can be no assurance that the elimination of certain duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the two businesses, will offset the incremental transaction-related costs over time. Thus, any net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, the long term or at all. 
 56 

Our pending acquisition of Premier Financial is subject to conditions, including certain conditions that may not be satisfied, and may not be completed on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, the Merger Agreement may be terminated in certain circumstances. Failure to complete the Merger could have material and adverse effects on us. 
 The completion of the Merger is subject to a number of conditions, which make the completion and timing of the completion of the Merger uncertain. In addition, the Merger Agreement may be terminated in certain circumstances. If the Merger is not completed on a timely basis, or at all, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the Merger, we and Premier Financial will be subject to a number of risks, including the following: 
 we will be required to pay certain costs relating to the Merger and the Private Placement, whether or not the Merger is completed, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor and printing fees; 

under the Merger Agreement, we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our respective businesses prior to completing the Merger, which may adversely affect our ability to execute certain of our respective business strategies; 

time and resources committed by our management to matters relating to the Merger could otherwise have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities; and 

the market price of our common stock could decline to the extent that the current market prices reflect a market assumption that the Merger will not be completed 

In addition, if the Merger is not completed, we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from our customers and employees. We also could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the Merger or to enforcement proceedings commenced against us to perform our obligations under the Merger Agreement. If the Merger is not completed, we cannot assure its shareholders that the risks described above will not materialize and will not adversely affect the business, financial results and market price of our Common Stock. 
 We are subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Merger is pending, which could adversely affect our business and operations. 
 Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to completing the Merger, which may adversely affect our ability to execute certain of our business strategies. Such limitations could negatively affect our businesses and operations prior to the completion of the Merger. Furthermore, the process of planning to integrate two businesses and organizations for the post-Merger period can divert management attention and resources and could ultimately have an adverse effect on us. 
 In connection with the Merger, parties with which we do business may experience uncertainty associated with the Merger, including with respect to current or future business relationships with us or the combined business. It is possible that some customers, suppliers and other persons with whom we have a business relationship may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships with us as a result of the Merger, which could negatively affect our revenues, earnings and cash flows, as well as the market price of shares of our common stock, regardless of whether the Merger is completed. 
 The market price of our common stock may decline in the future as a result of the Merger. 
 The market price of our common stock may decline in the future as a result of the Merger for a number of reasons, including due to: 
 an unsuccessful integration of Premier Financial (including for the reasons set forth in the preceding risk factors); or 

the failure of the combined company to achieve the perceived benefits of the Merger, including financial results, as rapidly as or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts. 

These factors are, to some extent, beyond our control. As a consequence, our shareholders could lose the value of their investment in our common stock.
