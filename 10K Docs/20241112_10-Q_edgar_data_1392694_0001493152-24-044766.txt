The
Company has historically incurred significant losses and has not, prior to 2023, demonstrated an ability to generate sufficient
revenues from the sales of its products and services to achieve profitable operations. There can be no assurance that we will have
profitable operations again in the future and could be sustained on a continuing basis. In making this assessment we
performed a comprehensive analysis of our current circumstances including: our financial position, our cash flows and cash usage
forecasts for the twelve months ending September 30, 2025, and our current capital structure including equity-based instruments and
our obligations and debts. 

Effective
February 7, 2024, the Affordable Connectivity Program ACP stopped accepting new applications and enrollments. The program
ceased funding on 1, 2024. See discussion below regarding revenue recognition. 

The
Company believes it has sufficient cash resources on hand to meet its current obligations for a period that is more than one year from
the issuance date of these financial statements. 

Management s
strategic plans include the following: 

Expand
 product and services offerings to a larger surrounding geographic area, 

Continuing
 to explore and execute prospective partnering or distribution opportunities and 

Identifying
 unique market opportunities that represent potential positive short-term cash flow.

TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 SEPTEMBER

The
Company evaluates acquisitions of assets and other similar transactions to assess whether the transaction should be accounted for as
a business combination or asset acquisition by first applying a screen test to determine whether substantially all of the fair value
of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. If so, the transaction
is accounted for as an asset acquisition. If not, further determination is required as to whether the Company has acquired inputs and
processes that can create outputs that would meet the definition of a business. When applying the screen test, significant judgment is
required to determine whether an acquisition is a business combination or an acquisition of assets. 

Accounting
for asset acquisitions falls under the guidance of Topic 805, Business Combinations, specifically Subtopic 805-50. A cost accumulation
model is used to determine an asset acquisition s cost. Assets acquired are based on their cost, generally allocated to them on
a relative fair value basis. Direct acquisition-related costs are included in the cost of the acquired assets. 

The
distinction between business combinations and asset acquisitions involves judgment, particularly when applying the screen test to determine
the nature of the transaction. Incorrect judgments or changes in decisions in these areas could materially affect the determination of
goodwill, the recognition and measurement of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, and, consequently, our financial position and results
of operations. 

Acquisition
of ClearLine Mobile, Inc 

On
January 5, 2024, the Company closed a purchase agreement and acquired ClearLine Mobile, Inc s. CLMI related software
development in exchange for . 

CLMI
produces a touchscreen display, positioned by the cash register, which is integrated into the SurgePays software platform and markets
SurgePays products 24/7 from a central server. SurgePays can advertise its entire suite of products and services while utilizing the
POS device for transactions. 

Following
the guidance of ASC 805, we performed the screen test to evaluate whether the acquired set is a business or a group of assets. The acquired
group of assets included inputs and a substantive process that together significantly contributed to the ability to create outputs. At
the time of purchase, CLMI had insignificant operations, however, the transaction was accounted for as a business combination in accordance
with ASC 805-50. 

Payments
are due and were paid as follows: 

- 
 at signing, 
 
 - 
 at closing, 
 
 - 
 90 days from closing (April 2024) 
 
 -

of Form 8-K. Additionally, the acquisition of CLMI was not deemed to be significant to the Company at any level under SEC Regulation
S-X 3.05 and did not require the presentation of any additional historical audited financial statements.

The
Company has experienced, and in the future may experience, variability in sales and earnings. The factors expected to contribute to this
variability include, among others, (i) the cyclical nature of the industry, (ii) general economic conditions in the various local markets
in which the Company competes, including a potential general downturn in the economy, and (iii) the volatility of prices in connection
with the Company s distribution of the product. These factors, among others, make it difficult to project the Company s operating
results on a consistent basis. 

Effective
February 7, 2024, the Affordable Connectivity Program ACP stopped accepting new applications and enrollments. The program
ceased funding on June 1, 2024. See discussion below regarding revenue recognition.

The
determination of fair value and the assessment of a measurement s placement within the hierarchy requires judgment. Level 3 valuations
often involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. Level 3 valuations may require the use of various cost, market, or income valuation
methodologies applied to unobservable management estimates and assumptions. Management s assumptions could vary depending on the
asset or liability valued and the valuation method used. Such assumptions could include estimates of prices, earnings, costs, actions
of market participants, market factors, or the weighting of various valuation methods. The Company may also engage external advisors
to assist us in determining fair value, as appropriate. Although the Company believes that the recorded fair value of our financial instruments
is appropriate, these fair values may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. 

The

Determine
the transaction price 

The
transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which the Company will be entitled in exchange for transferring services
to the customer. To the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration, the Company estimates the amount of variable consideration
that should be included in the transaction price utilizing either the expected value method or the most likely amount method depending
on the nature of the variable consideration. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in the Company s judgment,
it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. None of the Company s
contracts contain a significant financing component and there are no contracts with variable consideration. 

Allocate
the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract 

If
the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation.
However, if a series of distinct services that are substantially the same qualifies as a single performance obligation in a contract
with variable consideration, the Company must determine if the variable consideration is attributable to the entire contract or to a
specific part of the contract. For example, a bonus or penalty may be associated with one or more, but not all, distinct services promised
in a series of distinct services that forms part of a single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations
require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative standalone selling price basis unless
the transaction price is variable and meets the criteria to be allocated entirely to a performance obligation or to a distinct service
that forms part of a single performance obligation. The Company determines standalone selling price based on the price at which the performance
obligation is sold separately. If the standalone selling price is not observable through past transactions, the Company estimates the
standalone selling price taking into account available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines
related to the performance obligations. 

Recognize
revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation 

The
Company satisfies performance obligations either over time or at a point in time. Revenue is recognized at the time the related performance
obligation is satisfied by transferring a promised service to a customer. 

The
following reflects additional discussion regarding our revenue recognition policies for each of our material revenue streams. For each
revenue stream we do not offer any returns, refunds or warranties, and no arrangements are cancellable. Additionally, all contract consideration
is fixed and determinable at the initiation of the contract.

We
have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components and have elected to utilize the practical expedient to account for lease and
non-lease components together as a single combined lease component, from both a lessee and lessor perspective with the exception of direct
sales-type leases and production equipment classes embedded in supply agreements. From a lessor perspective, the timing and pattern of
transfer are the same for the non-lease components and associated lease component and, the lease component, if accounted for separately,
would be classified as an operating lease. 

We
have elected not to present short-term leases on the balance sheet as these leases have a lease term of 12 months or less at lease inception
and do not contain purchase options or renewal terms that we are reasonably certain to exercise. All other lease assets and lease liabilities
are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. Because most of our leases do not
provide an implicit rate of return, we used our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at lease commencement date
in determining the present value of lease payments. 

Our
leases, where we are the lessee, do not include an option to extend the lease term. For purposes of calculating lease liabilities, lease
term would include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options. 

Lease
expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as an operating expense, included as a component
of general and administrative expenses, in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. 

Certain
operating leases provide for annual increases to lease payments based on an index or rate, our lease has no stated increase, payments
were fixed at lease inception. We calculate the present value of future lease payments based on the index or rate at the lease commencement
date. Differences between the calculated lease payment and actual payment are expensed as incurred. 

In
2024, in connection with our purchase of CLMI, we acquired a right-of-use operating lease and related lease liability for a building
having a fair value of .

True
Wireless and SurgePays Litigation 

Blue
Skies Connections, LLC, and True Wireless, Inc. v. SurgePays, Inc., et. al.: In the District Court of Oklahoma County, OK, CJ-2021-5327,
filed on December 13, 2021. Plaintiffs petition alleges breach of a Stock Purchase Agreement by SurgePays, SurgePhone Wireless,
LLC, and Kevin Brian Cox Defendants ), and makes other allegations related to SurgePays consulting work with Jonathan
Coffman, formerly a True Wireless employee. Blue Skies alleged the Defendants are in violation of their non-competition and non-solicitation
agreements related to the sale of True Wireless from SurgePays to Blue Skies. Defendants filed various motions with the Court demonstrating
Oklahoma state law does not recognize non-compete agreements and non-solicitation agreements in the manner alleged by Plaintiffs, and
the Court granted these motions, finding the non-solicitation and non-competition clauses in the Stock Purchase Agreement void as a matter
of Oklahoma law. The matter continues in the discovery process with other dispositive motions pending. Mr. Coffman is no longer working
for True Wireless. An attempt at mediation in July, 2022 did not achieve a settlement. The petition requests injunctive relief, general
damages, punitive damages, attorney fees and costs for alleged breach of contract, tortious interference with a business relationship,
and fraud. Plaintiffs have made a written demand for damages and the parties continue to discuss a potential resolution. This matter
is an anti-competitive attempt by Blue Skies and True Wireless to damage SurgePays, SurgePhone, and Cox. Written discovery is winding
down and depositions began in the third quarter of 2023 and are expected to continue in 2024. The case is currently set for trial in
January 2025. 

In
the Circuit Court of Tennessee for the 30th Judicial District at Memphis, Docket # CT-3219-23. On August 8, 2023, a complaint was filed
by SurgePays for breach of a promissory note by Blue Skies Connections, LLC. The note at issue is dated June 14, 2021, and requires Blue
Skies Connections to repay the principal sum of 176,850.56, by monthly payments of 7,461.37 commencing on June 1, 2023. Blue Skies
Connections has failed to make any payments due under the terms of the note, and this breach entitles SurgePays to demand payment of
the entire amount of the note together with all accrued interest. Blue Skies Connections has responded by filing a Motion to Dismiss
or, in the alternative, a Motion to Stay, taking the position that, under the prior suit pending doctrine, the subject promissory note
is subject to the prior litigation instituted by Blue Skies Connections against SurgePays, styled Skies Connections, LLC and True Wireless,
Inc. v. SurgePays, Inc., et al., Case No. CJ-2021-5327, District Court of Oklahoma County, Oklahoma. Counsel for Blue Skies Connections
has requested that Surge Pays either voluntarily dismiss the subject action or agree to stay the subject action until conclusion of the
Oklahoma litigation. Surge Pays is presently reviewing and considering its options.

Mike
Fina litigation 

SurgePays,
Inc. et al. v. Fina et al., Case No. CJ-2022-2782, District Court of Oklahoma County, Oklahoma. Plaintiffs SurgePays, Inc. and Kevin
Brian Cox initiated this case against its former officer Mike Fina, his companies Blue Skies Connections, LLC, True Wireless, Inc., Government
Consulting Solutions, Inc., Mussell Communications LLC, and others. This case also arises from the June 2021 transaction by which SurgePays
sold True Wireless to Blue Skies. During the litigation of CJ-2021-5327 described above, SurgePays learned information that showed Mike
Fina breached his duties owed to True Wireless during his employment and consulting work for True Wireless prior to SurgePays 
sale of True Wireless to Blue Skies. SurgePays alleges that Mike Fina conspired with the other defendants to damage True Wireless thereby
harming the value of the company and causing its eventual sale at a greatly reduced price. SurgePays asserts claims for (i) breach of
contract; (ii) breach of fiduciary duty; (iii) fraud; (iv) tortious interference; and (v) unjust enrichment. At this stage, no defendant
has asserted a counterclaim against SurgePays. SurgePays filed a Second Amended Petition on January 27, 2023. Defendants Fina, Blue Skies,
True Wireless, and Government Consulting Solutions filed a Motion to Dismiss on March 10, 2023. On June 29, 2023, the Court granted the
Motion to Dismiss, ruling the claims asserted are derivative and could only be asserted by the True Wireless entity now
owed by Blue Skies. The Court rejected SurgePays request to certify this ruling for immediate appeal. Defendant Misty Garrett
filed a Motion for Summary Judgment seeking the same relief as the Motion to Dismiss, which was granted by the Court. It is SurgePays 
intent to appeal the Court s dismissal of Fina, Blue Skies, True Wireless, Government Consulting Solutions, and Misty Garrett.
At this stage, no attempts at settlement have been made.

SURGEPAYS,
 INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

 NOTES
TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 SEPTEMBER
30, 2024 

Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are computed by applying the federal and state income tax rates in effect to the gross amounts of temporary
differences and other tax attributes, such as net operating loss carry forwards. In assessing if the deferred tax assets will be realized,
the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some or all of these deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which these deductible
temporary differences reverse. As a result of historic losses, the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance as of September 30,
2024. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately and ,
respectively. The federal net operating losses carry forward indefinitely, and accordingly have not been reserved. The state net operating
losses will expire between the years ending December 31, 2036 and 2038. The state net operating losses have been fully reserved as management
does not believe that it is probable that the losses will be utilized before their expiration. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the valuation allowance increased by approximately . The total valuation allowance
results from the Company s estimate of its future recoverability of its net deferred tax assets. 

The
Company is in the process of analyzing their NOL and has not determined if the Company has had any change of control issues that could
limit the future use of these NOL s. As of December 31, 2023, all federal NOL carryforwards that were generated after 2017 may
only be used to offset 80 of taxable income and are carried forward indefinitely. 

The
Company follows the provisions of ASC 740, which requires the computations of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities
only consider tax positions that are more likely than not (defined as greater than 50 chance) to be sustained if the taxing authorities
examined the positions. There are no significant differences between the tax provisions represented in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements and that reported in the Company s income tax returns. The Company is subject to U.S. Federal and State income
tax examination by taxing authorities for the years after December 31, 2020. 

The
Company files corporate income tax returns in the United States and State of Tennessee jurisdictions. Due to the Company s net
operating loss posture, all tax years are open and subject to income tax examination by tax authorities. The Company s policy is
to recognize interest expense and penalties related to income tax matters as tax expense. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
respectively, there are unrecognized tax benefits, and there were no significant accruals for interest related to unrecognized tax
benefits or tax penalties.

ITEM
2: MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

This
statement contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ).
Discussions containing such forward-looking statements may be found throughout this statement. Actual events or results may differ materially
from those discussed in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including the matters set forth in this statement.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 and for the three months and nine months then ended
includes the accounts of SurgePays, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries during the period owned by SurgePays, Inc. 

SurgePays,
Inc SurgePays, we the Company was incorporated in Nevada on August 18, 2006, is a technology
and telecom company focused on the underbanked and underserved communities. SurgePays fintech platform empowers clerks at thousands of
convenience stores to provide a suite of prepaid wireless and financial products to underbanked customers. 

About
SurgePays, Inc. 

SurgePays,
Inc. SurgePays , we , the Company is a financial technology and telecom company focused on
providing these essential services to the underbanked community. We were previously known as North American Energy Resources, Inc. and
KSIX Media Holdings, Inc. Prior to April 27, 2015, we operated solely as an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the acquisition,
exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties and the production of oil and natural gas through its wholly owned subsidiary,
NAER. On April 27, 2015, NAER entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with KSIX Media whereby KSIX Media became a wholly owned subsidiary
of NAER and which resulted in the shareholders of KSIX Media owning approximately 90 of the voting stock of the surviving entity. While
we continued the oil and gas operations of NAER following this transaction, on August 4, 2015, we changed its name to KSIX Media Holdings,
Inc. On December 21, 2017, we changed its name to Surge Holdings, Inc. to better reflect the diversity of its business operations. We
changed our name to SurgePays, Inc. on October 29, 2020. 

As
described in more detail below, we currently operate in three different business segments through the following subsidiaries: (i) Surge
Blockchain, LLC, formerly Blvd. Media Group, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company; (ii) LogicsIQ, Inc., a Nevada corporation; (iii)
SurgePhone Wireless, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company; (iv) SurgePays Fintech, Inc., a Nevada limited liability company; (v) ECS
Prepaid, LLC, a Missouri limited liability company and (vi) Torch Wireless, LLC a Wyoming limited liability company.

Our
Business Segments 

Mobile
Virtual Network Operators 

We
provide mobile broadband (internet connectivity), voice and SMS text messaging to both subsidized and direct retail prepaid customers
through SurgePhone Wireless, LLC and Torch Wireless, LLC, wholly owned subsidiaries of SurgePays. We consider this the Mobile Virtual
Network Operators (MVNO) segment of our business. Prior to the expiration of the Affordable Connectivity Program (the ACP on June 1, 2024, we provided two types of MVNO s, subsidized and non-subsidized. Our subsidized MVNO s were licensed by the
Federal Communications Commission (the FCC to provide subsidized access to the internet through mobile broadband services
to consumers qualifying under the federal guidelines of the ACP. We provided these services by supplying consumers who were eligible
for the ACP with tablet devices with mobile broadband capabilities for use in their homes. For providing mobile broadband on tablets
to these eligible customers, until June 1, 2024, the ACP reimbursed us up to a 100 for the cost of each tablet device we distributed
and a 30 per customer, per month subsidy for mobile broadband (internet connectivity) services. Revenue from this portion of our business
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 accounted for 2 of our total revenue as compared to 90 for the three months ended September
30, 2023. Revenue from this portion of our business for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 accounted for 80 of our total revenue
as compared to 85 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. However, due to a lack of additional funding from Congress, April 2024
was the last month ACP households received the full ACP discount, as they had received in prior months, with some ACP households receiving
a partial ACP discount in May 2024 if their provider elected to participate in the May partial reimbursement month, as we did. Effective
June 1, 2024, households will no longer receive an ACP discount, and therefore until new or alternative funding for this program is available,
we expect revenue for the remainder of 2024 to substantially decrease as the ACP reimbursement was a substantial portion of the Company s
revenue. Despite the expiration of ACP, we have decided to continue to provide broadband capabilities on our tablets to our previously
subsidized customers with the belief that the ACP or a similar government program will be approved in the near future. 

As
a transition strategy moving forward, we decided to keep the existing base of subscribers from the former ACP enrolled in our
network through September 30, 2024 and beyond. We believe it would have been an easy, though short-sighted, decision to de-enroll
these subscribers once the ACP funding ran out because we have a built-in subscriber base of 250,000 and a distribution network of
thousands of local convenience stores and bodegas where our consumers shop every day. We believe these are huge and valuable assets
and to hold on to these valuable assets during this transition period, we chose to keep our subscribers active, absorb the wholesale
costs, averaging around 7-10 per subscriber per month, and put our strong balance sheet to work to replace the cash inflow we lost
once ACP funding ran out. We believe this plan will allow us to maintain our current customer base if ACP returns or will allow us
to utilize Lifeline. 

The
Company signed a Master Services Agreement (MSA) with TerraCom, Inc. TerraCom ), a
wireless service provider and licensed Lifeline provider, effective October 3, 2024. We will execute the strategy of
offering Lifeline to our existing ACP subscriber base. This agreement allows us to offer a government-subsidized program to our 280,000
ACP wireless subscribers. Equally important, we can now reignite our sales channels to acquire new Lifeline subscribers who lost
their ACP service when their carrier chose to shut them off. 

Through
our subsidiaries we plan to roll-out LinkUp Mobile over the remainder of 2024. This is the non-subsidized portion of our MVNO business,
which will attempt to leverage the volume of buying power we have with our previous subsidized subscriber base to build low-cost plans
using SIM kits in convenience stores transacting on the SurgePays network. Our market will be to penetrate rural America where there
is less competition and higher consumer pricing and offer incentivized family plans to the rapidly growing base of subsidized customer
households. The revenue will be generated by subscribers paying a monthly fee for talk, text and data carrier services on a prepaid basis.
As highlighted above, we continued to provide the previous ACP benefit to our subscriber base through September 30, 2024 in the hope the ACP
program would be re-established. It is our plan to communicate to this base our intention to transition these subscribers to our LinkUp
Mobile service line. 

Comprehensive
Platform Services 

We
provide financial technology and a wireless top-up platform to independently owned convenience stores throughout the country via our
subsidiaries SurgePays Fintech, ECS Prepaid, LLC, Electronic Check Services, Inc. and Central States Legal Services, Inc. We consider
these services the Comprehensive Platform Services segment of our business. 

Specifically,
our Comprehensive Platform Services provides ACH banking relationships and a fintech transactions platform that processes thousands of
transactions a day at independently owned convenience stores. The Comprehensive Platform Service also provides wireless top-up transactions
and wireless product aggregation for our nationwide network of convenience stores. By linking together, the customer, the carrier plan
and the convenience store to allow all parties to have one location to get what they need. 

Our
revenue is derived from the transaction that takes place when an individual using a prepaid cellular carrier plan needs to add more minutes
to their cellular phone. These services are vital to convenience store operations and we believe we can utilize our relationships with
convenience stores from our ACP services to expand the network for our Comprehensive Platform Services. The Company expects this segment
to be the biggest percentage of year-over-year revenue growth opportunity for 2024 and hired a new head of sales for our Comprehensive Platform
Service segment to tap into such growth opportunity. 

64 

Lead
Generation 

We
refer to LogicsIQ, Inc. as the Lead Generation segment of our business. LogicsIQ is a lead generation and case management solutions company
primarily serving law firms in the mass tort industry. Revenues from this segment of our business are earned from our lead generation
retained services offerings and call center activities through CenterCom. Lead generation consist of sourcing leads, which requires us
to drive traffic to our landing pages for a specific marketing campaign. We also achieve this in certain marketing campaigns by using
third-party preferred vendors to meet the needs of our clients. Revenues are recognized at the time the lead is delivered to the client.
If payment is received in advance of the delivery of services, it is included in deferred revenue, and subsequently recognized once the
performance obligation has been completed. Retained service offerings consist of turning leads into a retained legal case. To provide
this service to our customers, we qualify leads through verification of information collected during the lead generation process. Additionally,
we further qualify these leads using a client questionnaire which assists in determining the services to be provided. The qualification
process is completed using our call center operations. 

In
2023, we decided to focus less on this segment of our business and the Company is in the process of determining how best this
service fits into the overall plans of SurgePays. The Company still derived revenue from this segment of our business in 2023.
However, we have not received any revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and plan to make a final decision on
whether to maintain or discontinue the Lead Generation segment of its business before the end of the fiscal year ended
2024. 

COMPARISON
OF THREE MONTHS ENDED September 30, 2024 AND 2023 

Reclassifications 

Certain
prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on
the consolidated results of operations, stockholders deficit, or cash flows. 

We
measure our performance on a consolidated basis as well as the performance of each segment. 

We
report our financial performance based on the following segments: Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNO), Comprehensive Platform Service
(Top-up) and Lead Generation. The MVNO segment is further broken down into subsidized and non-subsidized components. The subsidized component
or ACP is the result of the mobile broadband (internet connectivity) services provided by SurgePhone Wireless and Torch Wireless to low-income
consumers and accounts for the majority of our revenue. The Comprehensive Platform Service segment is comprised of Surge Fintech and
ECS as previously shown. The Lead Generation is comprised of LogicsIQ as previously shown. 

The
segment amounts included in MD A are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting. Additional information
on our reportable segments is contained in Note 10 Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements.

Mobile
Virtual Network Operators consisting of SurgePhone Wireless and Torch Wireless revenues (as detailed in Notes 2 and 10 of the financial
statements) decreased by 30,638,724 (99.9 ). Due to a lack of additional funding from Congress, April 2024 was the last month ACP households
received the full ACP discount, as they had received in prior months, with some ACP households receiving a partial ACP discount in May
2024 if their provider elected to participate in the May partial reimbursement month, as we did. The 14.2 billion Congress initially
made available for the ACP has run out. As a result, the ACP has ended for now. Effective June 1, 2024, households will no longer receive
an ACP discount. As a transition strategy moving forward, we decided to keep the existing base of subscribers from the former ACP enrolled
in our network through September 30, 2024 and beyond. We believe it would have been an easy, though short-sighted, decision to de-enroll
these subscribers once the ACP funding ran out because we have a built-in subscriber base of 250,000 and a distribution network of thousands
of local convenience stores and bodegas where our consumers shop every day. We believe these are huge and valuable assets and to hold

around 7-10 per subscriber per month, and put our strong balance sheet to work to replace the cash inflow we lost once ACP funding ran
out. It is also our plan to communicate to this base our intention to transition these subscribers to our LinkUp Mobile service line.
Since the ACP was not funded, we expect revenue for the Company for the remainder of 2024 to substantially decrease because ACP reimbursement
was a substantial portion of our revenue. The Company signed a Master Services Agreement (MSA) with TerraCom, Inc. TerraCom ), a wireless service
provider and licensed Lifeline provider, effective October 3, 2024. We will execute the strategy of offering Lifeline to our
existing ACP subscriber base. This agreement allows us to offer a government-subsidized program to our 280,000 ACP wireless subscribers.
Equally important, we can now reignite our sales channels to acquire new Lifeline subscribers who lost their ACP service when their carrier
chose to shut them off. 

Lead
Generation services, consisting of LogicsIQ revenues decreased by 684,631 as a result of operational changes by management in late 2023.
The Company plans to make a final decision on whether to maintain or discontinue the Lead Generation segment of its business in fiscal
year ended 2024. 

Comprehensive
Platform Services revenues increased by 1,941,450 as a result of focusing our efforts on our MVNO segment, specifically the ACP
component of the MVNO segment while we strategized on how to enhance our sales and on-boarding approach to adding convenience stores
to our platform. The Company expects this segment to be the biggest percentage of year-over-year revenue growth opportunity for the
remainder of 2024. We hired a new sales director earlier in the year to start a B2B segment within our Platform Services. For the three
months ended September 30, 2024, new revenue of over 2.5 million and 19 total clients were created, as compared to zero revenue for the
three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Cost
of Revenue, Gross Profit and Gross Margin 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, cost of revenue for services primarily consists of data plan expenses 3,567,303), prepaid
retail expense 4,556,418), devices 175,170), marketing 3,719,197), advertising 116,771) and other expenses such as royalties
and call-center expenses 467,197). For the three months ended September 30, 2023, cost of revenue for services primarily consists of
data plan expenses 7,341,183), prepaid retail expense 2,832,308), devices 5,463,473), marketing 4,875,587), advertising 1,210,713)
and other expenses such as royalties and call-center expenses 1,957,325). 

We
expect that our cost of revenue will increase or decrease to the extent that our revenue increases and decreases. 

66 

In
addition, the Company plans to implement a new sales force for Comprehensive Platform Services to capture what we believe is an untapped
underbanked convenience store market. Our sales force team has increased to five as of September 30, 2024, from one as of September 30,
2023.

Gross
profit margin is calculated as revenue less cost of revenue. Gross profit margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue.
Our gross profit in future periods will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions that may impact our pricing, sales
mix among devices, sales mix changes among consumables, excess and obsolete inventories, and the cost of our products from manufacturers.
Our gross profit in future periods will vary based upon our revenue stream mix and may increase or decrease based upon our distribution
channels. We expect the gross margins to decrease overall as we transition from subsidized subscribers to non-subsidized subscribers

 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The Company engaged several contractors to overhaul the financial platform to allow
 for the conversion to a tablet-based transaction at the store level from the outdated VeriFone terminal. The Company also engaged
 with consultants to provide advisory services specifically in the area of investment relations to identify opportunities to increase
 our shareholder value. 

Professional
 services decreased 143,014 or 34.3 from the three months ended September 30, 2023 to the three months ended September 30, 2024
 primarily due to the lower legal fees. 

Compensation
 increased from 918,222 for the three months September 30, 2023 to 3,313,320 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily
 as a result of one-time non-cash component for stock compensation for the CEO and CFO of 1,758,982 per their employment agreements. 

Computer
 and internet costs decreased 40,143 or 13.9 from the three months ended September 30, 2023 to the three months ended September 30, 2024.
 The decrease was primarily the result of decreased programming and support services related to the maintenance and enhancements of
 the Clearline platform purchased in January of 2024. 

Advertising
 and marketing costs decreased to 14,351 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 89,069 for the three months ended September
 30, 2023 primarily as a result of the Company slowing expenditures related to Affordable Connectivity Program ACP stopped accepting new applications and enrollments effective February 7, 2024. 

Insurance
 expense decreased to 248,878 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 339,780 for the three months ended September 30,
 2023 primarily as a result of improved premium rates for the renewal of coverage in 2023/2024.

COMPARISON
OF NINE MONTHS ENDED September 30, 2024 AND 2023 

Reclassifications 

Certain
prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on
the consolidated results of operations, stockholders deficit, or cash flows. 

We
measure our performance on a consolidated basis as well as the performance of each segment. 

We
report our financial performance based on the following segments: Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNO), Comprehensive Platform Service
(Top-up) and Lead Generation. The MVNO segment is further broken down into subsidized and non-subsidized components. The subsidized component
or ACP is the result of the mobile broadband (internet connectivity) services provided by SurgePhone Wireless and Torch Wireless to low-income
consumers and accounts for the majority of our revenue. The Comprehensive Platform Service segment is comprised of Surge Fintech and
ECS as previously shown. The Lead Generation is comprised of LogicsIQ as previously shown. 

The
segment amounts included in MD A are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting. Additional information
on our reportable segments is contained in Note 10 Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements.

Mobile
Virtual Network Operators consisting of SurgePhone Wireless and Torch Wireless revenues (as detailed in Notes 2 and 10 of the financial
statements) decreased by 48,116,841 (53.7 ). Due to a lack of additional funding from Congress, April 2024 was the last month ACP households
received the full ACP discount, as they had received in prior months, with some ACP households receiving a partial ACP discount in May
2024 if their provider elected to participate in the May partial reimbursement month, as we did. The 14.2 billion Congress initially
made available for the ACP has run out. As a result, the ACP has ended for now. Effective June 1, 2024, households will no longer receive
an ACP discount. As a transition strategy moving forward, we decided to keep the existing base of subscribers from the former ACP enrolled
in our network through September 30, 2024 and beyond. We believe it would have been an easy, though short-sighted, decision to de-enroll
these subscribers once the ACP funding ran out because we have a built-in subscriber base of 250,000 and a distribution network of thousands
of local convenience stores and bodegas where our consumers shop every day. We believe these are huge and valuable assets and to hold
on to these valuable assets during this transition period, we chose to keep our subscribers active, absorb the wholesale costs, averaging
around 7-10 per subscriber per month, and put our strong balance sheet to work to replace the cash inflow we lost once ACP funding ran
out. It is also our plan to communicate to this base our intention to transition these subscribers to our LinkUp Mobile service line.
Since the ACP was not funded, we expect revenue for the Company for the remainder of 2024 to substantially decrease because ACP reimbursement
is a substantial portion of our revenue. 

Lead
Generation services consisting of LogicsIQ revenues decreased by 6,647,061 as a result of operational changes by management in late
2023. The Company plans to make a final decision on whether to maintain or discontinue the Lead Generation segment of its business in
fiscal year ending 2024. 

Comprehensive
Platform Services revenues increased by 1,243,927 as a result of hiring a sales director earlier in 2024 and focusing our efforts
on our MVNO segment, specifically the ACP component of the MVNO segment while we strategized on how to enhance our sales and
on-boarding approach to adding convenience stores to our platform. The Company expects this segment to be the biggest percentage of
year-over-year revenue growth opportunity for the remainder of 2024. We hired a new sales director earlier in the year to start a B2B segment within our Platform Services. For the nine months ended September
30, 2024, new revenue of over 2.7 million and 19 total clients were created, as compared to zero revenue for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. 

Cost
of Revenue, Gross Profit and Gross Margin 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cost of revenue for services primarily consists of data plan expenses 16,921,923), prepaid
expense retail 9,014,955), devices 5,001,192), marketing 15,281,613), advertising 4,432,173) and other expenses such as royalties
and call-center expenses 3,725,444). For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cost of revenue for services primarily consists
of data plan expenses 21,614,871), prepaid retail expense 8,056,869, devices 19,066,964), marketing 15,276,830), advertising 5,723,728) and other expenses such as royalties and call-center expenses 6,883,650). 

We
expect that our cost of revenue will increase or decrease to the extent that our revenue increases and decreases. 

70 

In
addition, the Company plans to implement a new sales force for Comprehensive Platform Services to capture what we believe is an untapped
underbanked convenience store market. Our sales force team has increased to five as of September 30, 2024, from one as of September 30, 2023.

Gross
profit margin is calculated as revenue less cost of revenue. Gross profit margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue.
Our gross profit in future periods will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions that may impact our pricing, sales
mix among devices, sales mix changes among consumables, excess and obsolete inventories, and the cost of our products from manufacturers.
Our gross profit in future periods will vary based upon our revenue stream mix and may increase or decrease based upon our distribution
channels. We expect the gross margins to decrease overall as we transition from subsidized subscribers to non-subsidized subscribers
through our LinkUp mobile service line.

 our shareholder value. 

Professional
 services increased 321,619 or 25.6 from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily
 due to the legal settlement of the Consumer Attorney Marketing Group, LLC case. 

Compensation
 increased from 3,409,495 for the nine months September 30, 2023 to 10,922,462 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily
 as a result of one-time non-cash component for stock compensation for the CEO and CFO of 6,237,976 per their employment agreements. 

Computer
 and internet costs increased 44,935 or 7.0 from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended September 30,
 2024. The increase was primarily the result of increased programming and support services related to the maintenance and enhancements
 of the Clearline platform purchased in January of 2024. 

Advertising
 and marketing costs decreased to 95,731 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 137,933 for the nine months ended September
 30, 2023 primarily as a result of the Company slowing expenditures related to Affordable Connectivity Program ACP stopped accepting new applications and enrollments effective February 7, 2024. 

Insurance
 expense decreased to 821,254 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 991,035 for the nine months ended September 30,

The
Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 48,116,841 as compared to the
nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 17,506,627 from the
same period ended September 30, 2023, due to a lack of additional funding from Congress, April 2024 was the last month ACP households
received the full ACP discount, as they had received in prior months, with some ACP households receiving a partial ACP discount in May
2024 if their provider elected to participate in the May partial reimbursement month, as we did. The 14.2 billion Congress initially
made available for the ACP has run out and as a result, the ACP has ended for now. Effective June 1, 2024, households will no longer
receive an ACP discount and therefore until new or alternative funding for this program is available, we expect revenue for the remainder
of 2024 to substantially decrease as the ACP reimbursement was a substantial portion of the Company s revenue. 

Lead
Generation 

The
revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 6,647,061 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The
revenue changed due to the continuing review of the line of business and how it best fits into the overall plans of the Company. 

Comprehensive
Platform Services 

The
revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 9,853,497 compared to 8,609,570 for the same period in 2023. The increase
of 14 was a continuing result of the Company shift from ACP to our prepaid retail line of business. We are committed to re-focusing our
attention to this market segment for 2024. 

Overall 

The
overall decrease in revenue of 53,539,179 from 2023 to 2024 for the nine months ended September 30, can be attributable to the lack
of additional funding and an end date of June 1, 2024 for ACP. The net operating income decreased by 41,404,089 to an operating
loss from nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

At
September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our current assets were 33,909,878 and 33,366,661, respectively, and our current liabilities
were 5,434,250 and 12,705,044, respectively, which resulted in a working capital surplus of 28,475,628 and of 20,661,617, respectively.
The increase in current assets is a result of a capital raise on January 15, 2024 which resulted in a net increase in cash of 17,249,994
and the exercise of warrants during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 8,799,257. 

Total
assets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 amounted to 41,499,493 and 41,925,307, respectively. The decrease in total assets
is a result of a capital raise and exercise of warrants, whereby cash increased by 23,812,520 and net loss for the period. Total assets
decreased by 425,814 from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, assets consisted of current assets of 33,909,878,
construction-in-process of 518,189, net property and equipment of 158,092, net intangible assets of 1,636,339, goodwill of 4,166,782,
equity investment in Centercom of 498,273, note receivable of 176,851, internal use software of 372,303, and operating lease right
of use asset of 62,786, compared to at December 31, 2023, current assets of 33,366,661, net property and equipment of 361,841, net
intangible assets of 2,126,470, goodwill of 1,666,782, equity investment in Centercom of 464,409, note receivable of 176,851, internal
use software of 539,424, operating lease right of use asset of 387,869, and deferred income taxes of 2,835,000. 

At
September 30, 2024, our total liabilities were 8,223,506 compared to total liabilities of 13,521,843 at December 31, 2023. This 5,298,337
decrease was related to the repayment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of the various notes payable. 

At
September 30, 2024, our total stockholders equity was 33,275,987 as compared to 28,403,464 at December 31, 2023. 

As
a result of the end of funding to the ACP, we expect to incur a loss for the calendar year 2024 as we transition our focus to the non-subsidized
market and LinkUp Mobile. Although the Company expects the loss of revenue from the ACP to have a substantial financial impact on the
Company, we believe that the Company s cash balance and working capital as of September 30, 2024, will be sufficient to fund operations
for at least the next twelve months.

The
following table sets forth the major sources and uses of cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Cash
requirements and capital expenditures At the current level of operations, the Company does not anticipate borrowing funds
to meet basic operating costs. 

Known
trends and uncertainties The Company is planning to acquire other businesses with similar business operations. The uncertainty
of the economy may increase the difficulty of raising funds to support the planned business expansion. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Management s
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which
were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial
statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions for the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Our estimates
are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results
of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, and any such differences may be material. 

While
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most
important to our financial condition and results of operations and which require our most difficult, subjective and complex judgments. 

Use
of Estimates 

Preparing
financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues
and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and those estimates may be material. 

Significant
estimates during the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, include, allowance for doubtful accounts
and other receivables, inventory reserves and classifications, valuation of loss contingencies, valuation of derivative liabilities,
valuation of stock-based compensation, estimated useful lives related to intangible assets, capitalized internal-use software development
costs, and property and equipment, implicit interest rate in right-of-use operating leases, uncertain tax positions, and the valuation
allowance on deferred tax assets. 

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments 

The
Company accounts for financial instruments under Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements .
ASC 820 provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures regarding fair value measurements. Fair value is defined
as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date, based on the Company s principal or, in absence of a principal, most advantageous market for the specific
asset or liability. 

The
Company uses a three-tier fair value hierarchy to classify and disclose all assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring
basis, as well as assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, in periods subsequent to their initial measurement.
The hierarchy requires the Company to use observable inputs when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs, when determining
fair value. 

The
three tiers are defined as follows: 

Level
 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted market prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets; 

Level
 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly in the marketplace
 for identical or similar assets and liabilities; and 

Level
 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market data, which require the Company to develop its own assumptions. 

The
determination of fair value and the assessment of a measurement s placement within the hierarchy requires judgment. Level 3 valuations
often involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. Level 3 valuations may require the use of various cost, market, or income valuation
methodologies applied to unobservable management estimates and assumptions. Management s assumptions could vary depending on the
asset or liability valued and the valuation method used. Such assumptions could include estimates of prices, earnings, costs, actions
of market participants, market factors, or the weighting of various valuation methods. The Company may also engage external advisors
to assist us in determining fair value, as appropriate. 

76 

Impairment of Long-lived
Assets including Internal Use Capitalized Software Costs 

Management evaluates the recoverability
of the Company s identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment
exists, in accordance with the provisions of ASC 360-10-35-15 Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Events
and circumstances considered by the Company in determining whether the carrying value of identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived
assets may not be recoverable include but are not limited to significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results;
significant changes in the use of the assets; significant negative industry or economic trends; and changes in the Company s business
strategy. In determining if impairment exists, the Company estimates the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and ultimate
disposition of these assets. 

If impairment is indicated based
on a comparison of the assets carrying values and the undiscounted cash flows, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the
amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. 

Inventory
Valuation 

Inventory
is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value (average cost). For items manufactured by third parties, cost is determined using
the weighted average cost method (WAC). We write down inventory when it has been determined that conditions exist that may not allow the
inventory to be sold for at the intended price or the inventory is determined to be obsolete based on assumption about future demand and
market conditions. The charge related to inventory write-downs is recorded as cost of goods sold. We evaluate inventory at least annually
and at other times during the year. We have incurred and may in the future incur charges to write down inventory. 

Internal
Use Software Development Costs 

We
capitalize certain internal use software development costs associated with creating and enhancing internally developed software related
to our technology infrastructure. These costs include personnel and related employee benefits expenses for employees who are directly
associated with and who devote time to software projects, and external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing
or obtaining the software. Software development costs that do not meet the qualification for capitalization, as further discussed below,
are expensed as incurred and recorded in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated results of operations. 

Revenue
from Contracts with Customers 

We
account for revenue earned from contracts with customers under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASC 606 ),
and ASC 842, Leases ASC 842 ). The core principle of ASC 606 is that a company should recognize revenue to depict
the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to
be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle: 

Step 1: Identify the
 contract with the customer. 

Step 2: Identify the
 performance obligations in the contract. 

Step 3: Determine the transaction price. 

Step 4: Allocate the
 transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. 

Step 5: Recognize revenue
 when, or as, the company satisfies a performance obligation. 

Stock-Based
Compensation 

The
Company accounts for our stock-based compensation under ASC 718 Compensation Stock Compensation using the
fair value-based method. Under this method, compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized
over the service period, which is usually the vesting period. This guidance establishes standards for the accounting for transactions
in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. It also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities
in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by
the issuance of those equity instruments. 

The
Company uses the fair value method for equity instruments granted to non-employees and use the Black-Scholes model for measuring the
fair value of options. 

The
fair value of stock-based compensation is determined as of the date of the grant or the date at which the performance of the services
is completed (measurement date) and is recognized over the vesting periods. 

Stock
Warrants 

In
connection with certain financing (debt or equity), consulting and collaboration arrangements, the Company may issue warrants to purchase
shares of its common stock. The outstanding warrants are standalone instruments that are not puttable or mandatorily redeemable by the
holder and are classified as equity awards. The Company measures the fair value of warrants issued for compensation using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model as of the measurement date. However, for warrants issued that meet the definition of a derivative liability, fair
value is determined based upon the use of a binomial pricing model. 

77 

Warrants
issued in conjunction with the issuance of common stock are initially recorded at fair value as a reduction in additional paid-in capital
of the common stock issued. All other warrants (for services) are recorded at fair value and expensed over the requisite service period
or at the date of issuance if there is not a service period. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

In
the normal course of business, we evaluate all new accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, SEC,
or other authoritative accounting bodies to determine the potential impact they may have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer
to Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of disclosure controls and procedures 

Under
the PCAOB standards, a control deficiency exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in
the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A significant deficiency
is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness,
yet important enough to merit the attention by those responsible for oversight of the company s financial reporting. A material
weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable
possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected
on a timely basis. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e)
promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). Our management has determined that, as of September 30,
2024, the Company s disclosure controls are effective, but the Company lacks segregation of duties similar to other companies our
size. 

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From
time to time, we may be engaged in various lawsuits and legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business. Except as described
below, we are currently not aware of any legal proceedings, the ultimate outcome of which, in our judgment based on information currently
available, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

The
following is a summary of threatened, pending, asserted or unasserted claims against us or any of our wholly owned subsidiaries for which
there have been material developments since December 31, 2023. 

(1) 

Juno Financial v. AATAC and Surge Holdings Inc.
AND Surge Holdings Inc. v. AATAC ; Circuit Court of Hillsborough County, Florida, Case # 20-CA-2712 DIV A: Breach of Contract, Account
Stated and Open Account claims against Surge by a factoring company. Surge has filed a cross-complaint against defendant AATAC for Breach
of Contract, Account Stated, Open Account and Common Law Indemnity. The Court dismissed the case with the agreement of the parties at
a case management conference on September 12, 2024. 

78 

(2) 
 On
 December 17, 2021, Ambess Enterprises, Inc. v SurgePays, Inc ., Blair County Pa. case number 2021 GN 3222. Plaintiff alleges
 breach of contract and prays for damages of approximately 73,000, plus fees, costs and interest. Litigation counsel is managing
 the motion practice and discovery process. The case was settled and dismissed in 2023 for 60,000, which has been recorded as a component
 of general and administrative expenses. 

(3) 
 Blue Skies Connections, LLC, and True Wireless, Inc.
 v. SurgePays, Inc. , 
 et. al.: In the District Court of Oklahoma County, OK, CJ-2021-5327, filed on December 13, 2021. Plaintiffs petition alleges
 breach of a Stock Purchase Agreement by SurgePays, SurgePhone Wireless, LLC, and Kevin Brian Cox Defendants ), and
 makes other allegations related to SurgePays consulting work with Jonathan Coffman, formerly a True Wireless employee. Blue
 Skies alleged the Defendants are in violation of their non-competition and non-solicitation agreements related to the sale of True
 Wireless from SurgePays to Blue Skies. Defendants filed various motions with the Court demonstrating Oklahoma state law does not
 recognize non-compete agreements and non-solicitation agreements in the manner alleged by Plaintiffs, and the Court granted these
 motions, finding the non-solicitation and non-competition clauses in the Stock Purchase Agreement void as a matter of Oklahoma law.
 The matter continues in the discovery process with other dispositive motions pending. Mr. Coffman is no longer working for True Wireless.
 An attempt at mediation in July, 2022 did not achieve a settlement. The petition requests injunctive relief, general damages, punitive
 damages, attorney fees and costs for alleged breach of contract, tortious interference with a business relationship, and fraud. Plaintiffs
 have made a written demand for damages and the parties continue to discuss a potential resolution. This matter is an anti-competitive
 attempt by Blue Skies and True Wireless to damage SurgePays, SurgePhone, and Cox. Written discovery is winding down and depositions
 began in the third quarter of 2023 and are expected to continue in 2024. The case is currently set for trial in January 2025. 

In
 the Circuit Court of Tennessee for the 30th Judicial District at Memphis, Docket # CT-3219-23. On August 8, 2023, a complaint was
 filed by SurgePays for breach of a promissory note by Blue Skies Connections, LLC. The note at issue is dated June 14, 2021, and
 requires Blue Skies Connections to repay the principal sum of 176,850.56, by monthly payments of 7,461.37 commencing on June 1,
 2023. Blue Skies Connections has failed to make any payments due under the terms of the note, and this breach entitles SurgePays
 to demand payment of the entire amount of the note together with all accrued interest. Blue Skies Connections has responded by filing
 a Motion to Dismiss or, in the alternative, a Motion to Stay, taking the position that, under the prior suit pending doctrine, the
 subject promissory note is subject to the prior litigation instituted by Blue Skies Connections against SurgePays, styled Skies Connections,
 LLC and True Wireless, Inc. v. SurgePays, Inc., et al., Case No. CJ-2021-5327, District Court of Oklahoma County, Oklahoma. Counsel
 for Blue Skies Connections has requested that Surge Pays either voluntarily dismiss the subject action or agree to stay the subject
 action until conclusion of the Oklahoma litigation. Surge Pays is presently reviewing and considering its options. 

(4) 
 Robert
 Aliotta and Steve Vasquesz, on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated v. SurgePays, Inc. d/b/a Surge Logics , filed
 January 4, 2023, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Case No. 1:23-cv-00042. Plaintiffs allege violations
 of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) and the Florida Telephone Solicitations Act (FTSA) based on telephone solicitations
 allegedly made by or on behalf of SurgePays, Inc. Plaintiffs seek damages for themselves and seek certification of a class action
 on behalf of others similarly situated. Defendants intend to vigorously defend the action however most similar cases are eventually
 resolved by an out-of-court settlement. A Confidential Settlement Agreement and Release of Claims has been entered into in April
 2024 and a Dismissal Order was entered by the Court on April 30, 2024. 

(5) 

SurgePays, Inc. et al. v. Fina et al., Case No.
CJ-2022-2782 , District Court of Oklahoma County, Oklahoma. Plaintiffs SurgePays, Inc. and Kevin Brian Cox initiated this case against
its former officer Mike Fina, his companies Blue Skies Connections, LLC, True Wireless, Inc., Government Consulting Solutions, Inc., Mussell
Communications LLC, and others. This case also arises from the June 2021 transaction by which SurgePays sold True Wireless to Blue Skies.
During the litigation of CJ-2021-5327 described above, SurgePays learned information that showed Mike Fina breached his duties owed to
True Wireless during his employment and consulting work for True Wireless prior to SurgePays sale of True Wireless to Blue Skies.
SurgePays alleges that Mike Fina conspired with the other defendants to damage True Wireless thereby harming the value of the company
and causing its eventual sale at a greatly reduced price. SurgePays asserts claims for (i) breach of contract; (ii) breach of fiduciary
duty; (iii) fraud; (iv) tortious interference; and (v) unjust enrichment. At this stage, no defendant has asserted a counterclaim against
SurgePays. SurgePays filed a Second Amended Petition on January 27, 2023. Defendants Fina, Blue Skies, True Wireless, and Government Consulting
Solutions filed a Motion to Dismiss on March 10, 2023. On June 29, 2023, the Court granted the Motion to Dismiss, ruling the claims asserted
are derivative and could only be asserted by the True Wireless entity now owed by Blue Skies. The Court rejected SurgePays 
request to certify this ruling for immediate appeal. Defendant Misty Garrett filed a Motion for Summary Judgment seeking the same relief
as the Motion to Dismiss, which was granted by the Court. It is SurgePays intent to appeal the Court s dismissal of Fina,
Blue Skies, True Wireless, Government Consulting Solutions, and Misty Garrett. At this stage, no attempts at settlement have been made. 

(6) 
 Consumer
 Attorney Marketing Group, LLC v . LogicsIQ, Inc. and SurgePays, Inc. On February 13, 2024, in the Superior Court of California,
 Los Angeles County, Case No. 24 ST CV 03653, Consumer Attorney Marketing Group, LLC CAMG filed a complaint naming
 SurgePays, Inc. (the Company a defendant and alleging claims for breach of contract, declaratory judgment and express
 and implied indemnity. The complaint demands that defendants indemnify CAMG for any damages or losses that CAMG may incur in the
 case Robert Aliotta, et al. v. SurgePays, Inc. d/b/a SurgeLogics , Case No. 23 C 00042, pending in the U.S. District Court
 for the Northern District of Illinois. CAMG s claims against the Company are solely based upon theories of participatory and
 vicarious liability. A Confidential Settlement Agreement and Release of Claims has been entered into in April 2024 and the parties
 await a Dismissal Order to be entered by the Court.

ITEM
1A: RISK FACTORS 

The
United States Government s dissolution of the Affordable Connectivity Program ACP will have a substantial adverse
effect on our current and planned business operations. 

Since
the introduction of the ACP, we have derived over 70 of our revenue from reimbursement payments from the federal government under the
ACP. Effective February 7, 2024, the ACP stopped accepting new applications and enrollments, and the program ceased funding on June 1,
2024. The cease in reimbursement payments from governmental agencies will have a substantial adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, and operating results as we transition our focus to the Company s other lines of business, such as non-subsidized market
and LinkUp Mobile, of which there is no guarantee the Company will successfully be able to meet or exceed the revenue that was previously
generated through subsidies from the ACP. Additionally, some of our growth plans for the non-ACP business segments of the Company are
dependent on the growth of the ACP customers, and we may lose the opportunity to expand our other business segments, which will have
a substantial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. 

We
may require additional capital as we endeavor to replace lost revenue from the ACP, but we do not have any commitments to obtain such
capital and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain adequate capital as and when required. 

Due
to the loss of revenue from the expiration of the ACP, we expect to incur a loss for the calendar year ended December 31, 2024. If we
fail to replace the lost revenue from the Company s other business segments, we will not be able to sustain our growth, which will
have a substantial adverse effect on the financial condition and operating results of the Company. We will need to adjust operations
to control our cash expenses; however, we cannot give assurance that we can increase our cash balances or limit our cash consumption
and thus maintain sufficient cash balances for our planned operations. Future business demands may lead to cash utilization at levels
greater than recently experienced. We may need to raise additional capital in the future. However, we cannot assure that we will be able
to raise additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all.

Issuer
Purchases of Equity Securities 

On
August 13, 2024, the Company entered into a share repurchase program with ThinkEquity LLC for up to 5,000,000 shares of its common stock.
During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reacquired, on the open market, 81,850 shares of stock for 146,836, at an average price of
 1.79/share. All shares purchased are intended to qualify for the safe harbor in rule 10b-18. On October 1, 2024, the Company decided
to terminate the share repurchase program and will no longer be making any reacquisitions.
