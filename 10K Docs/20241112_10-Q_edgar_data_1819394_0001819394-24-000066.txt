CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Report contains forward-looking statements. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Report, including statements concerning possible or assumed future actions, business strategies, events or results of operations, and any statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. 
 In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as may, should, expect, plan, anticipate, could, intend, target, project, contemplate, believe, estimate, predict, potential or continue or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. Forward-looking statements in this Report are predictions, projections and other statements about future events that are based on current expectations and assumptions and, as a result, are subject to risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual future events to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this document, including the inability to consummate the proposed transaction with CoStar Group, Inc. CoStar Group within the anticipated time period, or at all, due to any reason, including the failure to obtain required regulatory approvals or to satisfy the other conditions to the consummation of the proposed transaction with CoStar Group; the risk that the proposed transaction with CoStar Group disrupts Matterport s current plans and operations or diverts management s attention from its ongoing business; the effects of the proposed transaction with CoStar Group on Matterport s business, operating results, and ability to retain and hire key personnel and maintain relationships with customers, suppliers and others with whom Matterport does business; the risk that Matterport s stock price may decline significantly if the proposed transaction with CoStar Group is not consummated; the nature, cost and outcome of any legal proceedings related to the proposed transaction; our ability to grow market share in our existing markets or any new markets we may enter; our ability to respond to general economic conditions; our ability to manage our growth effectively; our success in retaining or recruiting our officers, key employees or directors, or changes required in the retention or recruitment of our officers, key employees or directors; the impact of the regulatory environment and complexities with compliance related to such environment; our ability to remediate our material weakness, or any other material weakness that we may identify in the future that could result in material misstatements in our financial statements; our ability to achieve and maintain profitability in the future; our ability to access sources of capital; our ability to maintain and enhance our products and brand, and to attract customers; our ability to manage, develop and refine our technology platform; the success of our strategic relationships with third parties; our history of losses and whether we will continue to incur continuing losses for the foreseeable future; our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights; our ability to implement business plans, forecasts, and other expectations and identify and realize additional opportunities; our ability to attract and retain new subscribers; the size of the total addressable market for our products and services; the continued adoption of spatial data; any inability to complete acquisitions and integrate acquired businesses; general economic uncertainty and the effect of general economic conditions in our industry; environmental uncertainties and risks related to adverse weather conditions and natural disasters; the volatility of the market price and liquidity of our Class A common stock, and other securities; the increasingly competitive environment in which we operate; and other factors detailed under the section entitled Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on February 27, 2024, and subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. 
 Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified and some of which are beyond our control, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The events and circumstances reflected in our forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur, and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Moreover, we operate in an evolving environment. New risk factors and uncertainties may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all risk factors and uncertainties. As a result of these factors, we cannot assure you that the forward-looking statements in this Report will prove to be accurate. Except as required by applicable law, we do not plan to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained herein, whether as a result of any new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise. 
 You should read this Report completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.

 Litigation The Company is named from time to time as a party to lawsuits and other types of legal proceedings and claims in the normal course of business. The Company accrues for contingencies when it believes that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate the amount of any such loss. 
 On July 23, 2021, plaintiff William J. Brown, a former employee and a stockholder of Matterport, Inc. (now known as Matterport Operating, LLC) Legacy Matterport ), sued Legacy Matterport, Gores Holdings VI, Inc. (now known as Matterport, Inc.), Maker Merger Sub Inc., Maker Merger Sub II, LLC, and Legacy Matterport directors R.J. Pittman, David Gausebeck, Matt Bell, Peter Hebert, Jason Krikorian, Carlos Kokron and Michael Gustafson (collectively, the Brown Defendants in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the Delaware Court of Chancery ). On September 3, 2021, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint advancing three counts. The plaintiff s complaint claimed that the Brown Defendants imposed invalid transfer restrictions on his shares of Matterport stock in connection with the Gores Merger transactions between Matterport, Inc. and Legacy Matterport (the Transfer Restrictions ), and that Legacy Matterport s board of directors violated their fiduciary duties in connection with a purportedly misleading letter of transmittal. The complaint sought damages and costs, as well as a declaration from the court that he may freely transfer his shares of Class A common stock of Matterport received in connection with the Gores Merger transactions. An expedited trial regarding the facial validity of the Transfer Restrictions took place in December 2021. On January 11, 2022, the court issued a ruling that the Transfer Restrictions did not apply to the plaintiff. The opinion did not address the validity of the Transfer Restrictions more broadly or whether Brown suffered any damages as a result of the Transfer Restrictions. Matterport filed a notice of appeal of the court s ruling on February 8, 2022, and a hearing was held in front of the Delaware Supreme Court on July 13, 2022, after which the appellate court affirmed the lower court s ruling. Separate proceedings regarding the plaintiff s remaining claims, including the amount of any damages suffered by Brown were the subject of the second phase of the

 million plus pre- and post-judgment interest as damages for losses caused by Matterport s initial refusal to issue freely transferable shares (the Brown Judgment ). The Company recorded an aggregate litigation expense of million in its consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. On July 29, 2024, the Company filed a notice of appeal of the court s ruling to the Delaware Supreme Court. Brown filed a notice of cross appeal on August 12, 2024. On August 14, 2024, the litigation bond was posted and the Company transferred million in cash as collateral into a designated insured account. On September 13, 2024, the Company filed its opening brief with the Delaware Supreme Court. On October 14, 2024, Brown filed its answering brief on appeal and opening brief on cross-appeal. The cash collateral of million was classified as restricted cash on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024 . 
 Since the Brown judgment, other former Legacy Matterport stockholders have filed similar complaints (the Post-Brown Complaints in the Delaware Court of Chancery alleging that such stockholders were prevented from trading their Matterport shares through invalid transfer restrictions, and seeking damages for the harm to the plaintiffs. These complaints were filed as follows: on July 19, 2024 by Damien Leostic and William Schmitt; on August 16, 2024 by Greg Coombe; on September 19, 2024 by Build Legacy LLC, Build the Future Trust under agreement dated November 16, 2023, Penchant Capital LLC, Penchant Trust, and iRobot Corporation. On September 16, 2024, Kimberly Burdi-Dumas, a former Matterport employee, filed a putative class action complaint on behalf of all persons or entities who were stockholders of Legacy Matterport as of July 21, 2021, and who, pursuant to the Gores Transaction, were thereafter issued and held Matterport shares that were improperly restricted from being sold until January 18, 2022. The Company has not yet answered the Post-Brown Complaints. Given the early stage of the cases, the Company is unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss that may result from the matters. 
 On February 1, 2024, stockholders, Laurie Hanna and Vasana Smith (collectively Plaintiffs filed a complaint derivatively on behalf of Matterport, Inc. against R.J. Pittman, Michael Gustafson, Peter Hebert, James Krikorian, James Daniel Fay, David Gausebeck, Japjit Tulsi, Judi Otteson, Jay Remley, and numerous stockholders of Matterport, Inc. (collectively Hanna and Smith Defendants in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The complaint alleges that the issuance of earn-out shares worth million was a breach of fiduciary duty and an act of corporate waste, which unjustly enriched recipients of the earn-out shares at the expense of Matterport and its common stockholders. Specifically, the Plaintiffs allege that issuance of the earn-out shares violated the February 7, 2021 Agreement and Gores Merger Agreement pursuant to which Legacy Matterport and Gores Holding VI, a publicly listed special purpose acquisition company, and two Gores subsidiaries merged, providing Legacy Matterport stockholders with shares of the surviving public company which took the name Matterport. The complaint seeks disgorgement of all unjust enrichment by the Hanna and Smith Defendants, an award of compensatory damages to Matterport, an award of costs and disbursements to the Plaintiffs, as well as a declaration that Plaintiffs may maintain the action on behalf of Matterport and that Plaintiffs are adequate representatives of Matterport, and a finding that demand on the Matterport board is excused as futile. On June 24, 2024, the Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which alleges, inter alia, that the members of the Matterport board breached their fiduciary duties by issuing a proxy statement which failed to disclose certain information concerning Matterport s prior issuance of certain earn-out shares previously issued and the subsequent impact on the amount of the CoStar Group Merger Consideration that would have been received by the plaintiffs and other stockholders if those earn-out shares had not been issued. The amended complaint sought an injunction to enjoin the stockholder vote relating to the Company s proposed transaction with CoStar Group, and seeks, among other things, damages, and an award of plaintiffs costs of the action, including reasonable attorneys and experts fees. The Plaintiffs in the Hanna Action filed a motion for

 of Surefield s patents. Redfin has asserted defenses in the litigation that the patents in question are invalid and have not been infringed upon. We have agreed to indemnify Redfin for this matter pursuant to our existing agreements with Redfin. The parties have vigorously defended against this litigation. The matter went to jury trial in May 2022 and resulted in a jury verdict finding that Redfin had not infringed upon any of the asserted patent claims and that all asserted patent claims were invalid. Final judgment was entered on August 15, 2022. On September 12, 2022, Surefield filed post trial motions seeking to reverse the jury verdict. Redfin has filed oppositions to the motions. In addition, on May 16, 2022, the Company filed a declaratory judgment action against Appliance Computing III, Inc., d/b/a Surefield, seeking a declaratory judgment that the Company had not infringed upon the patents asserted against Redfin and additional, related patent. The matter is pending in the Western District of Washington and captioned Matterport, Inc. v. Appliance Computing III, Inc. d/b/a Surefield, Case No. 2:22-cv-00669 (W.D. Wash.). Surefield has filed a motion to dismiss or in the alternative transfer the case to the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The Company filed an opposition to the motion. On August 28, 2023, the Court denied Surefield s motion to dismiss the Washington case but stayed the action pending the resolution of the Texas case. On October 7, 2024, the Texas court appointed a technical advisor to assist the court with post-trial motions. 
 On July 24, 2024, Vinatha Kutagula, the Company s former Chief Customer Officer, filed a complaint against the Company in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Santa Clara alleging unlawful retaliation and wrongful termination.

Each whole warrant entitles the holder to purchase share of the Company s Class A common stock at a price (the Warrants Price of per share, subject to adjustments. The Warrants became exercisable on December 15, 2021 and will expire on July 22, 2026, which is after the Closing. On January 14, 2022, the Public Warrants ceased trading on the Nasdaq Global Market. The Public Warrants were either exercised or redeemed as of January 14, 2022 and Public Warrants remained outstanding thereafter. A total of million Private Warrants remained outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Private Warrants have been exercised during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 The CoStar Group Merger Agreement provides that, following the date of the CoStar Group Merger Agreement, Matterport shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the holders of each outstanding and unexercised Private Warrants exercisable for shares of Matterport Common Stock to execute a conditional exchange agreement (the Conditional Exchange Agreement ). Pursuant to the Conditional Exchange Agreement, holders of each Private Warrants agree to exchange their Private Warrants for merger consideration upon the closing of CoStar Group Mergers. The warrant price applicable to the Conditional Exchange Agreements would be calculated in accordance with the terms of the Warrant Agreement. The warrant price applicable to the Conditional Exchange Agreements Conditional Warrant Price would be equal to the warrant price in effect as of the closing of CoStar Group Mergers, reduced by an amount (in dollars), calculated at the closing, equal to the difference of (i) the warrant price in effect prior to the closing minus (ii) (A) the Per Share Consideration minus (B) the Black-Scholes Warrant Value, which is the value of a Warrant immediately prior to the consummation of the CoStar Group Mergers based on the Black-Scholes Warrant Model for a Capped American Call on Bloomberg Financial Markets Bloomberg ). 
 Prior to the entry into the CoStar Group Merger Agreement, the Company used a Black-Scholes model to determine the fair value of the Private Warrants as Level 3 financial instruments. Since the Company entered into the CoStar Group Merger Agreement in April 2024, it has been using a probability-weighted scenario-based methodology to estimate the fair value of Private Warrants based upon an analysis of future values for the Private Warrants, assuming various outcomes of the pending CoStar Group Mergers. We considered two different scenarios: (a) continue using a Black-Scholes model to determine the fair value of the Private Warrants as Level 3 financial instruments as if the Company remains a standalone public company during the remaining warrant life term, and (b) the intrinsic present value of the Private Warrants upon exercise under the Conditional Warrant Price, assuming the CoStar Group Mergers are consummated as of December 31, 2024. The primary significant unobservable input used to evaluate the fair value measurement of the Company s Private Warrants is the expected volatility of the Company s Common Stock. A significant increase or decrease in the expected volatility in isolation would result in a significant change in fair value measurement. The Private Warrants were valued at per unit as of September 30, 2024.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis provides information that Matterport s management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of Matterport s condensed consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The discussion should be read together with our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements, the respective notes thereto, and other financial information included elsewhere within this Report. The discussion and analysis should also be read together with the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the related notes in the 2023 Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon Matterport s current expectations, estimates and projections that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed under Risk Factors , Forward-Looking Statements and other disclosures included in this Form 10-Q. 
 
 Overview 
 Matterport is leading the digitization and datafication of the built world. We were incorporated in 2011 and are headquartered in Sunnyvale, California. Matterport s website address is www.matterport.com. 
 Matterport s pioneering technology platform uses spatial data collected from a wide variety of digital capture devices to transform physical buildings and spaces into dimensionally accurate, photorealistic digital twins that provide our subscribers access to valuable building information and insights. For more than a decade, our platform has set the standard for digitizing, accessing and managing buildings, spaces and places online. This has resulted in the world s largest and most accurate library of spatial data with more than 47.3 billion square feet digitized to date. We deliver value to our customers by leveraging proprietary artificial intelligence AI insights to enhance customer experiences, improve operational efficiency, lower costs associated with promoting and operating buildings and accelerate business. We believe the digitization and datafication of the built world will fundamentally change the way people interact with buildings and the physical spaces around them. 
 The world is rapidly moving from offline to online. Digital transformation has made a powerful and lasting impact across every business and industry today. Nevertheless, the global building stock remains largely offline today, and we estimate that less than 0.1 is penetrated by digital transformation. We were among the first to recognize the increasing need for digitization of the built world and the power of spatial data, the unique details underlying buildings and spaces, in facilitating the understanding of buildings and spaces. With approxima tely 13.6 million spac es under management as of September 30, 2024, we are continuing to penetrate the estim ated 327 trillion global building stock and expand our footprint across various end markets, including residential and commercial real estate, facilities management, retail, architecture, engineering and construction AEC ), insurance and repair, and travel and hospitality. We estimate our total addressable market to be more than four billion buildings and 20 billion spaces globally, yielding a more than 240 billion market opportunity. 
 We believe the total addressable market for the digitization and datafication of the built world could expand beyond 1 trillion as our spatial data platform continues to grow, powered by the following: 
 Bringing offline buildings online: Traditionally, our customers needed to conduct site visits in-person to understand and assess their buildings and spaces. With the AI-powered capabilities of Cortex, our proprietary AI software engine, the world s building stock can move from offline to online and be accessible to our customers real-time and on demand from anywhere. 
 Driven by spatial data: Cortex uses the breadth of the billions of data points we have accumulated over the years to improve the 3D accuracy of our digital twins. Our sophisticated algorithms also deliver significant commercial value to our subscribers by generating data-based insights that allow them to confidently make assessments and decisions about their properties. With approximately 13.6 million spaces under management as of September 30, 2024 , our spatial data library is the clearinghouse for information about the built world. 
 Powered by AI and ML: Artificial intelligence AI and machine learning ML technologies effectively utilize spatial data to create a robust virtual experience that is dynamic, realistic, interactive, informative and permits multiple viewing angles. AI and ML also make costly cameras unnecessary for everyday captures subscribers can now capture their spaces by simply tapping a button on their smartphones. As a result, Matterport is a device agnostic platform, helping us more rapidly scale and drive towards our mission of digitizing and indexing the built world.

 We believe that Matterport has tremendous growth potential ahead. After securing market-leading positions in a variety of geographies and vertical markets, we have demonstrated our repeatable value proposition and the ability of our sales growth model to scale. The magnitude of our total addressable market is so large that even with leading market share, we believe our penetration rates today are a small fraction of the opportunity for Matterport. With a mature and tested go-to-market playbook and team in place, we are focused on scaling execution across a carefully selected set of growth vectors, including: scaling the enterprise across industry verticals, expanding internationally, investing in R D, and expanding partner integrations and third-party developer platforms. 
 Overview of Transaction with CoStar Group 
 On April 21, 2024, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the CoStar Group Merger Agreement with CoStar Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation CoStar Group ), Matrix Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of CoStar Group CoStar Group Merger Sub I ), and Matrix Merger Sub II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of CoStar Group CoStar Group Merger Sub II and, together with CoStar Group Merger Sub I, the CoStar Group Merger Subs ). Pursuant to the CoStar Group Merger Agreement, CoStar Group Merger Sub I will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of CoStar Group (the Costar Group First Merger ). Immediately thereafter, subject to the terms of the CoStar Group Merger Agreement and, in certain circumstances, at the discretion of CoStar Group, the Company will merge with and into CoStar Group Merger Sub II, which will survive the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of CoStar Group (the CoStar Group Second Merger and, together with the CoStar Group First Merger, the CoStar Group Mergers ). 
 
 Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the CoStar Group Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the CoStar Group First Merger (the First Effective Time ), each share of Class A common stock, par value 0.0001 per share, of the Company (each a Matterport Share and collectively, the Matterport Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time (other than Matterport Shares held by the Company (including in treasury), CoStar Group or their respective subsidiaries and Matterport Shares that are held by stockholders who have perfected and not withdrawn a demand for appraisal rights pursuant to Delaware law) will be converted into the right to receive (i) 2.75 in cash (the Per Share Cash Consideration plus (ii) a number of shares of CoStar Group common stock, par value 0.01 per share (the CoStar Group Shares ), equal to the Exchange Ratio (as defined in the CoStar Group Merger Agreement), subject to a right to receive cash in lieu of fractional shares (such cash and shares collectively, the CoStar Group Merger Consideration ). 
 
 The consummation of the CoStar Group Mergers are subject to various conditions, including, among others, (i) the expiration of the applicable waiting period (or extensions thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the receipt of other approvals under specified antitrust and foreign investment laws, (ii) absence of any law or order prohibiting the CoStar Group Mergers, (iii) the accuracy of the parties respective representations and warranties in the CoStar Group Merger Agreement, (iv) compliance and performance by the parties with their respective covenants in the CoStar Group Merger Agreement in all material respects, and (v) the absence of a material adverse effect (as defined in the CoStar Group Merger Agreement) with respect to Matterport or CoStar Group on or after the date of the CoStar Group Merger Agreement. 
 
 On July 3, 2024, Matterport and CoStar Group each received a request for additional information and documentary materials (the Second Request from the Federal Trade Commission (the FTC in connection with the FTC s review of the CoStar Group Mergers. The effect of the Second Request is to extend the waiting period imposed by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the HSR Act ), until 30 days after Matterport and CoStar Group have each substantially complied with their respective second requests, unless that period is extended or terminated sooner by the FTC. Each of Matterport and CoStar Group expect to respond promptly to the Second Request and to continue to work cooperatively with the FTC in its review of the CoStar Group Mergers. The CoStar Group Mergers, which are expected to be consummated in the fourth quarter of 2024 or the first quarter of 2025, were approved by Matterport stockholders at a special meeting held on July 26, 2024, but remains subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. If the CoStar Group Mergers are consummated, the Common Stock will be delisted from the NASDAQ Global Market and deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

 Impacts of Macroeconomic and Geopolitical Conditions and Other Factors on our Business 
 We are being impacted by uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions. These conditions include but are not limited to inflation , foreign currency fluctuations, slowing of economic activity around the globe, unstable global credit markets and financial conditions, in part due to rising interest rates, and cautious consumer spending. In addition, the escalating tensions between Taiwan and China, the war in Ukraine and the Israeli-Palestinian military conflict have further increased existing global economic challenges, including supply chain, logistics, and inflationary challenges. Such global or regional economic and political conditions adversely affect demand for our products. These conditions could have an impact on our suppliers, causing increases in cost of materials and higher shipping and transportation rates, and as a result impact the pricing of our products. We purchase certain products and key hardware components from a limited number of sources, including in some cases only a single supplier for some products and components, and depend on the supply chain, including freight, to receive components, transport finished goods and deliver our products across the world. The industry-wide global supply chain challenges, including with respect to manufacturing, transportation and logistics, could impact our operational and financial performance adversely, including impacts on our subscribers and their spending habits, could impact our marketing efforts, and affect our suppliers. If macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions do not improve or if they worsen, then our results of operations may be negatively impacted. Our cost-restructuring efforts are helping us to improve our operational excellence and to mitigate the impact of these macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions. 
 
 In July 2023, we initiated a restructuring plan to improve our operational cost structure and accelerate the timeline to profitability. This included a workforce reduction of approximately 30 , and the cease use of certain lease office spaces. The Company completed all actions under the 2023 Plan as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 Total restructuring costs associated with the 2023 Plan impacted cost of revenue and operating expenses in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. No significant restructuring charges were incurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Our standard subscription plans for individuals and small businesses range from a free online Matterport account with a single user and a single active space that can be captured with an iPhone or an Android smartphone to multiple-user accounts that provide for the capture of unlimited active spaces. The pricing of our subscription plans increases as the number of users and active spaces increase. The wide variety and flexibility of our subscription plans enable us to retain existing subscribers and grow our subscriber base across diverse end markets, with particular focus on large enterprise subscribers. Subscription revenue accounted for approximately 58 and 56 of our total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and approximately 58 and 54 of our total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 The majority of our subscription services are billed either monthly or annually in advance and are typically non-refundable and non-cancellable. Consequently, for month-to-month subscriptions, we recognize the revenue monthly, and for annual or longer subscriptions, we record deferred revenue on our condensed consolidated balance sheet and recognize the deferred revenue ratably over the subscription term. 
 Services Revenue 
 Most of our customers are able to utilize the Pro3 Camera, Pro2 Camera or other compatible capture devices to capture digital twins without external assistance, as the camera is relatively easy to configure and requires minimal training. However, our customers sometimes may also request professional assistance with the data capture process. We generate professional services revenue from Matterport Capture Services, a fully managed solution for enterprise subscribers worldwide that require on-demand scheduling of experienced and reliable Matterport professionals to capture their properties. In addition, we derive services revenue from in-app purchases made by subscribers using our smartphone applications or by logging in to their subscriber account. In July 2022, we completed the acquisition of VHT, Inc., known as VHT Studios VHT ), a U.S.-based real estate marketing company that offers brokerages and enterprise digital solutions to promote and sell properties, which expands Matterport Capture Services by bringing together Matterport digital twins with professional photography, drone capture, and marketing services. Services revenue accounted for approximat ely 25 and 24 of our total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and approximately 25 and 25 of our t otal revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 Product Revenue 
 We offer a comprehensive set of solutions designed to provide our customers with access to state-of-the-art capture technology that produces the high-quality data necessary to process images into dimensionally accurate digital twins. We derive product revenue from sales of our innovative 3D capture product. Our product line includes the Pro3 Camera, Pro2 Camera, and Matterport Axis. 
 
 Pro3 Camera: In August 2022, we launched and began shipment of our Pro3 Camera along with major updates to our industry-leading digital twin cloud platform. The Matterport Pro3 Camera is an advanced 3D capture device, which includes faster boot time, swappable batteries, and a lighter design. The Pro3 camera can perform both indoors and outdoors and is designed for speed, fidelity, versatility, and accuracy. Along with our Pro2 Camera, we expect that future sales of our Pro3 Camera will continue to drive increased adoption of our solutions. 
 
 Pro2 Camera: The Pro 2 Camera has played an integral part in shaping the 3D building and property visualization ecosystem, which has driven adoption of our solutions and has generated the unique high-quality and scaled data set that has enabled Cortex to become the pioneering software engine for digital twin creation. 
 
 Matterport Axis: A cost-effective, hands-free motor-mount accessory for smartphones. 
 
 Product revenue account ed for approximately 17 and 19 of our total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and approximately 17 and 21 of our total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Key Metrics 
 We monitor the following key metrics to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions. The calculation of the key metrics discussed below may differ from other similarly titled metrics used by other companies, analysts, investors and other industry participants. 
 Spaces Under Management 
 We track the number of spaces that have been captured and filed on the Matterport platform, which we refer to as spaces under management, because we believe that the number of spaces under management is an indicator of market penetration and the growth of our business. A space can be a single room or building, or any one contiguous capture of a discrete area, and is composed of a collection of imagery and spatial data that is captured and reconstructed in a dimensionally accurate digital twin of the captured space. For tracking purposes, we treat each captured and filed space as a unique file or model. We have a history of growing the number of our spaces under management and, as of September 30, 2024, we had appro ximately 13.6 million spaces under management. The scale of our spaces under management allows us to directly monetize each space managed for our paid subscribers as well as increase our ability to offer new and enhanced services to subscribers, which in turn provides us with an opportunity to convert subscribers from free subscription plans to paid plans. We believe our spaces under management will continue to grow as our business expands with our current customers and as we add new free and paid subscribers. 
 The following chart shows our spaces under management for each of the periods presented (in millions):

 Total Subscribers 
 We believe that our ability to increase the number of subscribers on our platform is an indicator of market penetration, growth of our business and future revenue trends. For purposes of our business, a subscriber is an individual or entity that has signed up for a Matterport account during the applicable measurement period. We include both free and paid subscribers in our total subscriber count. We refer to a subscriber that has signed up for a free account and typically captures only one free space allocated to the account as a free subscriber. We refer to a subscriber that has signed up for one of our paid subscription levels and typically captures at least one space as a paid subscriber. Our paid subscribers typically enter into monthly subscriptions with us. We generally consider a single organization to be a single subscriber if the organization has entered into a discrete enterprise agreement with us, even if the organization includes multiple divisions, segments or subsidiaries that utilize our platform. If multiple individuals, divisions, segments or subsidiaries within an organization have each entered into a discrete subscription with us, we consider each individual account to be a separate subscriber. 
 
 We believe the number of paid subscribers on our platform is an important indicator of future revenue trends, and we believe the number of free subscribers on our platform is important because free subscribers may over time become paid subscrib ers on our platform and are therefore another indicator of our future revenue trend. We continue to demonstrate strong growth in th e number of free and paid subscribers on our platform as indicated by our results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The following chart shows the number of our free subscribers, paid subscribers and total subscribers for each of the periods presented (in thousands):

 Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 We believe that our growth and financial performance are dependent upon many factors, including the key factors described below, which are in turn subject to significant risks and challenges. 
 Penetrating a Largely Undigitized Global Property Market 
 Despite the rapid pace of digital transformation in today s world, the massive global building stock, estimated by Savills to be 327 trillion in total property value, remains largely undigitized today, and we estimate that less than 0.1 is penetrated by digital transformation. As a first mover in digital twin creation and spatial data library construction, we see significant opportunities to continue leading the digitization and datafication of the built world. We estimate that there are more than 4 billion buildings and 20 billion spaces in the world globally, yielding a more than 240 billion market opportunity. We believe that as Matterport s unique spatial data library and property data services continue to grow, this opportunity could increase to more than 1 trillion based on the size of the building stock and the untapped value creation available to buildings worldwide. Property digitization and datafication are expected to accelerate on a global basis in both frequency and magnitude as the visually immersive and dimensionally accurate digital twins help increase productivity and reduce costs for our customers with the solutions that we have developed for diverse markets over the past decade. 
 Through providing a comprehensive set of solutions from cutting-edge capture technology and high-accuracy digital twins to valuable property insights, our AI-powered platform delivers value across the property lifecycle to subscribers from various end markets, including residential and commercial real estate, facilities m anagement and retail, AEC, insurance and repair, and travel and hospitality. As of September 30, 2024, we had over 1,100,000 subscribers on our platform and approximately 13.6 million spaces under management and we aim to continue scaling our platf orm and strengthen our foothold in various end markets and geographies to deepen our market penetration. With the acquisition of VHT VHT Acquisition completed in July 2022, we were able to service more property listings and position ourselves to increase adoption of digital twin technology and expand further into the residential real estate industry while adding marketing services for other vertical markets such as commercial real estate, travel and hospitality, and the retail sector. We believe that the breadth and depth of the Matterport platform along with the strong network effect from our growing spatial

Table of Contents 

 data library will lead to increased adoption of our solutions across diverse end markets, enabling us to drive further digital transformation of the built world. 
 Adoption of our Solutions by Enterprise Subscribers 
 We are pioneering the transformation of the built world from offline to online. We provide a complete, data-driven set of solutions for the digitization and datafication of the built world across a diverse set of use cases and industries. We take a largely offline global property market to the online world using a data-based approach, creating a digital experience for subscribers to interact with buildings and spaces and derive actionable insights. Our Cortex AI-driven engine and software platform uses the breadth of the billions of data points we have accumulated over the years to improve the 3D accuracy of our digital twin models. Our ML algorithms also deliver significant commercial value to our subscribers by generating data-based insights that allow them to confidently make assessments and decisions about their properties. We provide enterprise subscribers with a comprehensive solution that includes all of the capture, design, build, promote, insure, inspect and manage functionality of our platform. 
 
 We believe that our scale of data, superior capture technology, continued focus on innovation and considerable brand recognition will drive a continued adoption of our all-in-one platform by enterprise subscribers. 
 
 We are particularly focused on acquiring and retaining large enterprise subscribers because of the significant opportunities to expand our integrated solutions to different parts of an organization and utilize digital twins for more use cases within an organi zation. In January 2023, we announced that our customer selected Matterport s digital twin platform and 3D capture technology to build a virtual Operations Center for remote management of over 60 facilities across North America, South America, Europe and Asia. Matterport s platform creates simulated digital replicas of the manufacturing facilities, where teams can remotely track progress, plan for site changes, and collaborate remotely. In September 2023, we announced our latest collaboration with a leading global provider of construction management software, expanding Matterport s platform ecosystem support for design and construction management software services. Users can now use features directly within Matterport s photorealistic 3D digital twins, creating a visual system-of-record for site conditions, centralizing record-keeping and enabling better progress tracking, quality control, and more efficient closeout processes. In November 2023, we announced a new partnership intended to deliver 3D digital twin-powered connectivity solutions for facilities management across industrial automation, smart buildings, and broadband with a leading global supplier of network infrastructure and digitization solutions. We also announced a multi-year partnership with a leading vacation rental management platform to leverage Matterport s Digital Twin Platform and Capture Services to more efficiently and effectively capture, document and promote each of its listings. In April 2024, we announced our partnership with one of the largest fitness companies in North America to use Matterport s leading digital twin and photography services to ensure brand consistency across marketing materials for its U.S. franchise locations. In May 2024, we announced that one of the largest banks in North America has leveraged Matterport s digital twin platform to streamline site visits across its physical footprint. In June 2024, we announced our partnership with the leading innovator of Multiple Listing Service MLS technology to introduce listing-completion features, automatically populating property data and media assets from digital twins, and leapfrogging the current listing process. As September 30, 2024, many of the Fortune 1000 companies use Matterport to manage their enterprise facilities, real estate portfolios, factories, offices, and retail locations. We will continue improving our proprietary spatial data library a nd AI-powered platform to strengthen our long-term relationships and commitments with large enterprise customers streamlining our sales and marketing resources to enhance enterprise adoption of our solutions. 
 
 Retention and Expansion of Existing Subscribers 
 Our ability to increase revenue depends in part on retaining our existing subscribers and expanding their use of our platform. We offer an integrated, comprehensive set of solutions including spatial data capturing, digital twin creation, publication, vertical-market specific content, and property analytics. We have a variety of subscription plans to meet the needs of every subscriber, including free subscription plans and several standard paid subscription plans, and we are able to provide customized subscription plans tailored to the specific needs of large enterprises. As we seek to develop long-term subscriber relationships, our value proposition to subscribers is designed to serve the entirety of the property lifecycle, from design and build to maintenance and operations, promotion, insure, repair, restore, secure and finance. As a result, we believe we are uniquely positioned to grow our revenue with our existing subscribers as our platform helps them discover opportunities to drive both short and long term returns on their property investments. 
 Given the all-in-one nature of our platform and its ease of use, we are also able to drive adoption of our solutions across various parts of an organiza tion. For example, we established our long-term relationship with large commercial real estate clients which included being engaged to create digital twins for available office spaces for promotion and leasing, working with the subscriber s construction team to redesign office spaces through integrating our digital twins with the 
 39 

Table of Contents 

 construction team s design software, and conducting due diligence of potential real property acquisitions. As a result of our long-term focus and expansion strategy, we have been able to retain our subscribers and drive increased usage of our platform. 
 Scaling Across Various Industry Verticals 
 Matterport s fundamental go-to-market model is built upon a subscription first approach. We have invested aggressively to unlock a scalable and cost-effective subscription flywheel for customer adoption. With our large spatial data library and pioneering AI-powered capabilities, we pride ourselves on our ability to deliver value across the property lifecycle to subscribers from various end markets, including residential and commercial real estate, facilities management and retail, AEC, insurance and repair, and travel and hospitality. We focus on industry-specific sales and marketing initiatives to increase sales efficiency and drive subscriber and recurring revenue growth. We will continue to improve our spatial data library and AI-powered platform to address the workflows of the industries we serve, while expanding our solutions and reaching new real estate segments. 
 International Expansion 
 We are focused on continuing to expand our AI-powered spatial data platform to all corners of the world. Given that the global building stock remains largely undigitized today and with the vast majority of the world s buildings located outside of the United States, we expect significant opportunities in pursuing the digitization and datafication of the building stock worldwide. We use a land and expand model to capitalize on the potential for geographic expansion. We continue to seek to further penetrate our existing geographies in order to add their spatial data to our platform. In June 2023, we partnered with one of the largest value-added distributors VAD ), significantly expanding our presence in Latin America. With a network of more than 2,000 resellers, this partnership will provide Matterport s digital twin solutions to two of the largest property markets in the region, Mexico and Colombia. In July 2023, we partnered with a distributor of global technologies and managed security services to offer Matterport s digital twin platform to Government, Enterprise and SMB customers out of its offices in the United Arab Emirates, India, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and South Africa. Subscribers outside the United States accounted for approximately 45 and 44 of our subscription revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Given the flexibility and ease of use of our platform and capture device agnostic data capture strategy, we believe that we are well-positioned to further penetrate existing and additional geographies with our existing multiple sales attachment points and a global marketing effort in place. 
 
 Investing in Research and Innovation for Growth 
 We continuously evaluate our focus in research and development to improve Cortex, expand our solutions portfolio, and support seamless integration of our platform with third-party software applications. We plan to concentrate on in-house innovation and expect to consider acquisitions on an opportunistic basis. Since the launch of Matterport for iPhone, we have been continuously developing a robust pipeline of new product releases, including releasing the Android Capture app, collaborating with Facebook AI (now known as Meta) to release the world s largest dataset of 3D spaces, and launching Notes and Matterport for Mobile. In February 2023, we launched Digital Pro, an all-in-one marketing solution for real estate agents. Digital Pro combines the innovation of Matterport s 3D digital twin technology with integrated marketing and content production services to create the industry s most affordable, comprehensive marketing package to help real estate professionals manage more listings and sell homes faster. In June 2023, we announced Genesis, a new initiative that aims to deliver generative AI across its digital twin platform for customers looking to bolster the efficiency and profitability of their property portfolios worldwide. Genesis combines Matterport s stable of DL and computer vision innovations, including Cortex AI and Property Intelligence, with generative AI to deliver a new generation of digital twins. Combining generative AI and property insights, Matterport s digital twin platform aims to reshape the real estate landscape, optimizing interior design, space utilization, energy efficiency, safety, and accessibility while transforming property marketing strategies. In September 2023, we announced the launch of a beta program for the next generation of intelligent digital twins with powerful new capabilities fueled by the Company s rapid advancements in AI and data science. Customers can access automated measurements, layouts, editing, and reporting capabilities generated from their digital twins. Property Intelligence is now available worldwide. In October 2024, we unveiled a suite of new tools designed to enhance the way professionals design, build, and market properties Fall 2024 Release ). Our customers can use these tools to help defurnish a home and generate property descriptions automatically. The Fall 2024 Release included additional new features, such as 3D model merge, field tags, and bill-back processing. 
 While we plan to concentrate on in-house innovation, we may also pursue acquisitions of products, teams and technologies on an opportunistic basis to fu rther expand the functionality of and use cases for our platform. Our philosophy 
 40 

Table of Contents 

 is to adopt a long-term perspective in the evaluation of acquisition opportunities in order to ensure sustainable value creation for our customers. 
 Expanding Partner Integrations and Third-Party Developer Platform 
 We aim to foster a strong network of partners and developers around our Matterport platfo rm. Through integration with our open, scalable and secure enterprise platform, organizations across numerous industries have been able to automate workflows, enhance subscriber experiences and create custom extensions for high-value vertical applications. In March 2023, we announced a new integration with Autodesk Construction Cloud, a portfolio of software and services that combines advanced technology, a builders network and predictive insights for construction teams, making it easier for project teams using Matterport and Autodesk Build to collaborate within critical project management workflows. This new integration allows project stakeholders to enhance the Request for Information (RFI) process in Autodesk Build, moving from traditional methods of communication to immersive digital twin technology, powered by Matterport. In April 2023, we announced the general availability of new integrations with IoT TwinMaker, enabling enterprise customers to seamlessly connect Internet of Things (IoT) data into visually immersive and dimensionally accurate Matterport digital twins. Our solution that is integrated with Amazon Web Services (AWS) IoT TwinMaker makes it easier for developers to create digital twins of real-world systems such as buildings, factories, industrial equipment, and production lines. The offering from Matterport supports enterprise digital transformation efforts by providing customers with an efficient and cost-effective solution to remotely optimize building operations, increase production output, improve equipment performance, and increase environmental health and safety at their facilities. In November 2023, we announced in advance of Autodesk University, a new Computer-Aided Design CAD file add-on that will enable the simple creation of CAD files directly from Matterport digital twins to speed up design workflows using Matterport. The Matterport CAD file add-on is now available. We achieved AWS IoT competency status in July 2024. 
 We believe that our future growth and scale depend partially upon our ability to develop a strong ecosystem of partners and developers which can augment the value of our platform. Going forward, we plan to establish additional strategic partnerships with leading software providers through the Matterport Platform Partner Program, in which our industry partners and developers can build, develop, and integrate with our spatial data library. We will also invest in the Matterport Developer Program to enlarge our marketplace of value-added third-party applications built on top of the Matterport platform. We expect that monetization opportunities from partner integrations and the third-party developer marketplace will allow us to drive subscriber growth and develop a more loyal subscriber base, and the revenue derived from the marketplace will grow over time. 
 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 Our revenue consists of subscription revenue, license revenue, services revenue and product revenue. 
 Subscription revenue We provide our software as a service on our Matterport platform. Subscribers use our platform under different subscription levels based on the number of active spaces. We typically bill our subscribers monthly or annually in advance based on their subscription level and recognize revenue from subscriptions for our services over the term of the subscription. 
 Services revenue Services revenue consists of capture services and add-on services. Capture services consist of professional services in which a Matterport-qualified third-party technician will provide on-site digital capture services for the customer. Our extensive capture solutions also include photos, videos, drone imaging and digital marketing services. Under the capture service arrangements, we pay the third-party technician and bill the customer directly. Add-on services consist of additional software features that the customer can purchase. These services are typically provided by third parties under our direction and oversight, and we pay the third party and bill the subscriber directly for the provisions of such services. 
 Product revenue Product revenue consists of revenue from the sale of capture devices, including our Pro3 and Pro2 Cameras, Matterport Axis, and out-of-warranty repair fees. Customers place orders for our products, and we fulfill the orders and ship the devices directly to the customer or, in some cases, we arrange for the shipment of devices from third parties directly to the customer. We recognize product revenue associated with a sale in full at the time of shipment of the product. In some cases, customers prepay for the ordered device and, in other cases we bill the customer upon shipment of the device. Customers purchasing capture devices from us also typically subscribe to the Matterport platform for use with their captured spaces. However, we do not require Pro3 or Pro2 Camera owners to have a subscription when purchasing a 
 41 

Table of Contents 

 Pro3 or Pro2 Camera. We will also repair Pro3 and Pro2 Cameras for a fee if the nature of the repair is outside the scope of the applicable warranty. 
 Cost of Revenue 
 Cost of revenue consists of cost of subscription revenue, cost of license revenue, cost of services revenue, and cost of product revenue. Restructuring costs are also included in cost of revenue in the individual categories. 
 Cost of subscription revenue Cost of subscription revenue consists primarily of costs associated with hosting and delivery services for our platform to support our subscribers and other users of our subscribers spatial data, along with our customer support operations. Cost of subscription revenue also includes amortization of internal-use software and stock-based compensation. 
 Cost of services revenue Cost of services revenue consists primarily of costs associated with capture services and costs for add-on features. Costs for capture services are primarily attributable to services rendered by third-party technicians that digitally capture spaces on behalf of the applicable customer, as well as administration and support costs associated with managing the program. Costs for add-on features are primarily attributable to services rendered by third-party contractors that develop the floor plans or other add-ons applications purchased by our subscribers as well as support costs associated with delivering the applications. 
 Cost of product revenue Cost of product revenue consists primarily of costs associated with the manufacture of our Pro3 and Pro2 Cameras, warranty and repair expenses relating to Pro3 and Pro2 Cameras and personnel-related expenses associated with manufacturing employees including salaries, benefits, bonuses, overhead and stock-based compensation. Cost of product revenue also includes depreciation of property and equipment, costs of acquiring third-party capture devices, and costs associated with shipping devices to customers. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Our operating expenses consist primarily of research and development expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and sales commissions. Operating expenses also include overhead costs and restructuring costs. 
 Research and development expenses Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses associated with our research and development employees, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation. Research and development expenses also include third-party contractor or professional services fees, and software and subscription services dedicated for use by our research and development organization. In addition, research and development expenses that qualify as internal-use software development costs are capitalized. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling, general, and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses associated with our sales and marketing, finance, legal, information technology, human resources, facilities, and administrative employees, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, sales commissions, and stock-based compensation. We capitalize and amortize commissions associated with attracting new paid subscribers and services revenue over a period of three years, which is the estimated period for which we expect to benefit from the sales commissions. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include external legal, accounting, and other professional services fees, software and subscription services, and other corporate expenses. 
 Litigation expense Litigation expense consists of a litigation contingent liability and charges related to a former employee and shareholder of the Company who filed the initial, the second amended and the third amended complaint in July 2021, September 2021, and September 2022, respectively, for the share transfer restriction of his shares of Class A common stock of Matterport received in connection with the Gores Merger, and for damages as a result of the share transfer restrictions. 
 Interest Income

Table of Contents 

 Change in Fair Value of Warrants Liability 
 The private warrants are subject to fair value remeasurement at each balance sheet date if outstanding, or upon the time immediately before the exercise or redemption. As of September 30, 2024, there were 1.7 million Private Warrants outstanding. Matterport expects to incur incremental income (expense) in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the fair value change for the outstanding privat e warrants liability going forward at the end of each reporting period or through the exercise of such warrants. 
 Other Income, net 
 Other income, net consists primarily of accretion of discounts, net of amortization related to investment premiums. 
 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 Provision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes in certain foreign and state jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We record income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. These differences are measured using the enacted statutory tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which differences are expected to reverse. We recognize the effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates in income in the period that includes the enactment date. 
 We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.

 Subscription revenue increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to higher volume of subscription plans from new subscribers, expanded use of the subscription by existing subscribers, and a subscription price increase implemented since the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. Of the 2.5 million increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 2.8 million was attributable to the higher volume of subscription plans from new subscribers, partially offset by a decrease of approximately 0.3 million from existing customers during that period. Of the 9.9 million increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 8.2 million was attributable to the higher volume of subscription plans from new subscribers and approximately 1.7 million was attributable to sales to existing customers during that period. 
 Services revenue increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to increased sales of capture services and up-scaled add-on services, primarily driven by our investment in growing our capture services business and the increase in the number of our subscribers. 
 Product revenue decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume of our Pro2 and Pro3 cameras.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to our results of operations below, we report certain financial measures that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). These measures have limitations as analytical tools when assessing our operating performance and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures, including gross profit and net income. We may calculate or present our non-GAAP financial measures differently than other companies who report measures with similar titles and, as a result, the non-GAAP financial measures we report may not be comparable with those of companies in our industry or in other industries. 
 
 Non-GAAP Loss from Operations 
 We calculate non-GAAP loss from operations as GAAP loss from operations excluding share-based compensation related charges (including share-based payroll tax expense), restructuring charges, acquisition transaction costs related to the planned acquisition, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and litigation expense, which we do not consider to be indicative of our overall operating performance. We believe this measure provides our management and investors with consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and is an important indicator of the performance and profitability of our business. 
 The following table presents our non-GAAP loss from operations for each of the periods presented (in thousands):

Free Cash Flow 
 We calculate free cash flow as net cash used in operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and capitalized software and development costs. We believe this metric provides our management and investors with an important indicator of the ability of our business to generate additional cash from our business operations or our need to access additional sources of cash, in order to fund our operations and investments.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 Our capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the growth and expansion of our paid subscribers, development of our technology and software platform (including research and development efforts), expansion of our sales and marketing activities and sales, general and administrative expenses. As of September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities investment of appro ximately 405.2 million, which were held for working capital purposes and for investment in growth opportunities. Our marketable securities generally consist of U.S. government agency securities, treasury bills, corporate bonds, corporate and other debt securities. On August 14, 2024, the litigation bond related to the Brown case was posted and the Company transferred 95.0 million in cash as collateral into a designated insured account. The cash collateral of 95.0 million was classified as restricted cash on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024 . To date, our principal sources of liquidity have been proceeds received from the issuance of equity, proceeds from the Gores Merger and proceeds from warrant and option exercises for cash.

 246,642 340,098 Total cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and investments 
 405,182 423,000 
 We have incurred negative cash flows from operating activities and significant losses from operations in the past. We expect to continue to incur operating losses at least for the next 12 months due to the investments that we intend to make in our business. Cash used in operations has improved but could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the impact of litigation expense. As a result, we may require additional capital resources to grow our business. Ou r future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including an increase in our customer base, the timing and extent of spend to support the expansion of sales, marketing and development activities. Management believes that its current financial resources are sufficient to continue operating activities for at least one year past the issuance date of the financial statements. 
 Other commitments 
 There have been no material changes to our material cash requirements or non-cancellable contractual commitments. We lease office space under operating leases for our U.S. headquarters and other locations in the United States that expire at various dates through 2025. In addition, we have purchase obligations, which include contracts and issued purchase orders containing non-cancellable payment terms to purchase third-party g oods and services. As of September 30, 2024, our 12-month lease obligations (through September 30, 2025) totaled approximately 0.5 million. Our non-cancellable purchase obligations as of September 30, 2024 totaled approximately 7.3 million and are due through the year ending December 31, 2026.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. We evaluated the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates and believe that the following involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity and are most significant to reporting our results of operations and financial position and are therefore discussed as critical. 
 
 We believe that the critical accounting estimates discussed under Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our 2023 Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates as filed in such report. Refer to Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part I, Item 1 of this Report for more information on our adoption of new accounting guidance.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Matterport is subject to market risk, primarily relating to potential losses arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Currently, our revenue is primarily generated in U.S. dollars. Our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our operations, which are primarily in the United States, the United Kingdom (U.K.), Japan and Singapore. However, there has been, and may continue to be, significant volatility in global stock markets and foreign currency exchange rates that result in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in which we conduct business. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar may potentially decrease our revenue given our prices are fixed in foreign currencies for some of our end-customers outside of the United States, and to the extent that our customers pay for our products and services in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. If the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen, this could adversely affect our operations and cash flows in the future. In addition, the increase of non-U.S. dollar denominated contracts and the growth of our international entities in the future may result in greater foreign currency denominated sales, which would increase our foreign currency risk. The effect of a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our business would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024. To date, we have not engaged in any hedging strategies. As our international operations grow, we will continue to reassess our approach to managing the risk relating to fluctuations in currency rates. 
 Inflation Risk 
 We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. If our costs become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a 15(e) and Rule 15d 15(e) under the Exchange Act that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, with sufficient time to allow management to make timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024 because of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, as described in further detail below. In light of the material weakness described below, the Company performed additional analyses and other post-evaluation procedures and determined that its consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S.GAAP. Accordingly, management concluded that the financial statements included in this report fairly present in all material respects the Company s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. 
 Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. Specifically, management determined we did not design and maintain appropriate controls to ensure allegations received outside of the whistleblower program are evaluated and communicated to those responsible for financial reporting and those charged with governance in a timely fashion. The material weakness was determined to have existed as of December 31, 2023, and remains unremediated as of September 30, 2024. While the Company has determined that this material weakness did not result in a misstatement to the Company s consolidated financial statements, until remediated, this material weakness could result in a misstatement of one or more accounts or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. 
 Remediation Plan 
 Management is actively engaged in the planning for, and implementation of, remediation efforts to address the material weakness identified above. Our remediation plan includes enhancing the design of controls and procedures related to communicating allegations received outside of the whistleblower program to those responsible for oversight of the Company's financial reporting and those charged with governance. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act that occurred during the three-month period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Table of Contents 

 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their respective costs. Inherent limitations in all control systems include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error, mistake or otherwise. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by the collusion of two or more people or by an override of the controls by management. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected even with a well conceived and operated control system.

 Part II - Other Information 
 None. 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 On July 23, 2021, plaintiff William J. Brown, a former employee and a stockholder of Matterport, Inc. (now known as Matterport Operating, LLC) Legacy Matterport ), sued Legacy Matterport, Gores Holdings VI, Inc. (now known as Matterport, Inc.), Maker Merger Sub Inc., Maker Merger Sub II, LLC, and Legacy Matterport directors R.J. Pittman, David Gausebeck, Matt Bell, Peter Hebert, Jason Krikorian, Carlos Kokron and Michael Gustafson (collectively, the Brown Defendants in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the Delaware Court of Chancery ). On September 3, 2021, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint advancing three counts. The plaintiff s complaint claimed that the Brown Defendants imposed invalid transfer restrictions on his shares of Matterport stock in connection with the Gores Merger transactions between Matterport, Inc. and Legacy Matterport (the Transfer Restrictions ), and that Legacy Matterport s board of directors violated their fiduciary duties in connection with a purportedly misleading letter of transmittal. The complaint sought damages and costs, as well as a declaration from the court that he may freely transfer his shares of Class A common stock of Matterport received in connection with the Gores Merger transactions. An expedited trial regarding the facial validity of the Transfer Restrictions took place in December 2021. On January 11, 2022, the court issued a ruling that the Transfer Restrictions did not apply to the plaintiff. The opinion did not address the validity of the Transfer Restrictions more broadly or whether Brown suffered any damages as a result of the Transfer Restrictions. Matterport filed a notice of appeal of the court s ruling on February 8, 2022, and a hearing was held in front of the Delaware Supreme Court on July 13, 2022, after which the appellate court affirmed the lower court s ruling. Separate proceedings regarding the plaintiff s remaining claims, including the amount of any damages suffered by Brown were the subject of the second phase of the case. The Company s position was that Brown did not suffer any damages as he would have sold his shares as soon as possible after the Gores Merger transaction closed had the Company not prevented him from trading based on its application of the Transfer Restrictions. The plaintiff filed a Third Amended Complaint on September 16, 2022, which asserted the causes of action described above but omitted as defendants Maker Merger Sub Inc., Maker Merger Sub II, LLC, and Legacy Matterport directors David Gausebeck, Matt Bell, and Carlos Kokron, and added an additional cause of action alleging that Matterport, Inc. violated the Delaware Uniform Commercial Code by failing to timely register the plaintiff s requested transfer of Matterport, Inc. shares. The remaining defendants answer to the Third Amended Complaint was filed on November 9, 2022. Trial was held in November 2023 and a post-trial hearing was held on February 22, 2024. On May 28, 2024, the court ruled that Matterport had a reasonable basis to deny the plaintiff s November 2021 demand that the transfer restrictions be removed from his shares and that the plaintiff lacked standing as to whether the transfer restrictions complied with Delaware law. However, the court awarded the plaintiff 79.1 million plus pre- and post-judgment interest as damages for losses caused by Matterport s initial refusal to issue freely transferable shares (the Brown Judgment ). The Company recorded an aggregate litigation expense of 95.0 million in its consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. On July 29, 2024, the Company filed a notice of appeal of the court s ruling to the Delaware Supreme Court. Brown filed a notice of cross appeal on August 12, 2024. On August 14, 2024, the litigation bond was posted and the Company transferred 95.0 million in cash as collateral into a designated insured account. On September 13, 2024, the Company filed its opening brief with the Delaware Supreme Court. On October 14, 2024, Brown filed its answering brief on appeal and opening brief on cross-appeal. The cash collateral of 95.0 million was classified as restricted cash on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024 . 
 Since the Brown judgment, other former Legacy Matterport stockholders have filed similar complaints (the Post-Brown Complaints in the Delaware Court of Chancery alleging that such stockholders were prevented from trading their Matterport shares through invalid transfer restrictions and seeking damages for the harm to the plaintiffs. These complaints were filed as follows: on July 19, 2024 by Damien Leostic and William Schmitt; on August 16, 2024 by Greg Coombe; on September 19, 2024 by Build Legacy LLC, Build the Future Trust under agreement dated November 16, 2023, Penchant Capital LLC, Penchant Trust, and iRobot Corporation. On September 16, 2024, Kimberly Burdi-Dumas, a former Matterport employee, filed a putative class action complaint on behalf of all persons or entities who were stockholders of Legacy Matterport as of July 21, 2021, and who, pursuant to the Gores Transaction, were thereafter issued and held Matterport shares that were improperly restricted from being sold until January 18, 2022. The Company has not yet answered the Post-Brown Complaints. Given the early stage of the cases, the Company is unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss that may result from the matters. 
 On February 1, 2024, two stockholders, Laurie Hanna and Vasana Smith (collectively Plaintiffs filed a complaint derivatively on behalf of Matterport, Inc. against R.J. Pittman, Michael Gustafson, Peter Hebert, James Krikorian, James Daniel Fay, David Gausebeck, Japjit Tulsi, Judi Otteson, Jay Remley, and numerous stockholders of Matterport, Inc. (collectively Hanna and Smith Defendants in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The complaint alleges that the issuance of 23,460,000 earn-out shares worth 225 million was a breach of fiduciary duty and an act of corporate waste, which 
 56 

Table of Contents 

 unjustly enriched recipients of the earn-out shares at the expense of Matterport and its common stockholders. Specifically, the Plaintiffs allege that issuance of the earn-out shares violated the February 7, 2021 Agreement and Gores Merger Agreement pursuant to which Legacy Matterport and Gores Holding VI, a publicly listed special purpose acquisition company, and two Gores subsidiaries merged, providing Legacy Matterport stockholders with shares of the surviving public company which took the name Matterport. The complaint seeks disgorgement of all unjust enrichment by the Hanna and Smith Defendants, an award of compensatory damages to Matterport, an award of costs and disbursements to the Plaintiffs, as well as a declaration that Plaintiffs may maintain the action on behalf of Matterport and that Plaintiffs are adequate representatives of Matterport, and a finding that demand on the Matterport board is excused as futile. On June 24, 2024, the Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which alleges, inter alia, that the members of the Matterport board breached their fiduciary duties by issuing a proxy statement which failed to disclose certain information concerning Matterport s prior issuance of certain earn-out shares previously issued and the subsequent impact on the amount of the CoStar Group Merger Consideration that would have been received by the plaintiffs and other stockholders if those earn-out shares had not been issued. The amended complaint sought an injunction to enjoin the stockholder vote relating to the Company s proposed transaction with CoStar Group, and seeks, among other things, damages, and an award of plaintiffs costs of the action, including reasonable attorneys and experts fees. The Plaintiffs in the Hanna Action filed a motion for a preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the stockholder vote and a motion for expedited proceedings regarding the motion for a preliminary injunction. On July 11, 2024, the court denied Plaintiffs motion to expedite. 
 On June 3, 2024, a purported Matterport stockholder filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned Andrew Rose v. Matterport, Inc., et al., naming Matterport and each member of the Matterport board as defendants (the Rose Complaint ). The complaint alleged that CoStar Group s Form S-4 Registration Statement filed with the SEC on May 21, 2024 was materially misleading and omitted certain purportedly material information relating to the sales process, financial projections of Matterport and CoStar Group, the valuation analyses performed by Qatalyst Partners, and negotiations over the terms of post-transaction employment of certain Matterport employees. The complaint asserted violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder against all defendants, and violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the Company s board. The complaint sought, among other things, an injunction enjoining consummation of the CoStar Group Mergers, an order directing the individual defendants to issue a new Registration Statement, and an award of plaintiff s costs of the action, including plaintiff s reasonable attorneys and experts fees. On August 6, 2024, the Rose Complaint was voluntarily dismissed. 
 
 Additionally, on July 9, and July 11, 2024, purported Matterport stockholders filed complaints in the New York Supreme Court, captioned Hamilton v. Matterport, Inc., et al., Case No. 653458/2024 (the Hamilton Action and Scott v. Matterport, Inc., et al., Case No. 653515/2024 (the Scott Action ), respectively. These complaints name Matterport and each member of the Matterport board as defendants and allege, inter alia, that the notice of special meeting of stockholders and definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A, dated June 10, 2024 misrepresents or omits certain purportedly material information relating to financial projections for Matterport, the valuation analyses performed by Qatalyst Partners, and potential conflicts of interest faced by Matterport insiders. The complaints assert claims for common law negligent misrepresentation and common law negligence. The complaints seek, among other things, an injunction enjoining consummation of the CoStar Group Mergers, damages, and an award of plaintiff s costs of the action, including plaintiff s reasonable attorneys and experts fees. In addition to the Hamilton and Scott Actions, Matterport has received additional demand letters alleging similar deficiencies or omissions regarding the disclosures made in the Registration Statement, and requesting relevant books and records. On July 25, 2024, one such purported Matterport stockholder filed suit in the Delaware Court of Chancery, captioned Layton v. Matterport, Inc., Case No. 2024-0792 (the Layton Action ). On July 29, 2024, the Delaware Court of Chancery stayed the action at the request of plaintiff s counsel during the pendency of the CoStar Group Mergers. Matterport notes that: (i) the Hanna Action, the Hamilton Action, the Scott Action, or the Layton Action may be amended; (ii) additional, similar complaints may be filed; or (iii) additional demand letters may be delivered. These events could prevent or delay completion of the Mergers and result in additional costs to Matterport. Matterport believes that the Hanna Action, the Hamilton Action, the Scott Action, the Layton Action and the demand letters are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against them. 
 On May 11, 2020, Redfin Corporation Redfin was served with a complaint by Appliance Computing, Inc. III, d/b/a Surefield Surefield ), filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, Waco Division. In the complaint, Surefield asserted that Redfin s use of Matterport s 3D-Walkthrough technology infringes four of Surefield s patents. Redfin has asserted defenses in the litigation that the patents in question are invalid and have not been infringed upon. We have agreed to indemnify Redfin for this matter pursuant to our existing agreements with Redfin. The parties have vigorously defended against this litigation. The matter went to jury trial in May 2022 and resulted in a jury verdict finding that Redfin had not infringed upon any of the asserted patent claims and that all asserted patent claims were invalid. Final judgment was entered on August 15, 2022. On September 12, 2022, Surefield filed post trial motions seeking to reverse the jury verdict. Redfin has filed oppositions to the motions. In addition, on May 16, 2022, the Company filed a 
 57 

Table of Contents 

 declaratory judgment action against Appliance Computing III, Inc., d/b/a Surefield, seeking a declaratory judgment that the Company had not infringed upon the four patents asserted against Redfin and one additional, related patent. The matter is pending in the Western District of Washington and captioned Matterport, Inc. v. Appliance Computing III, Inc. d/b/a Surefield, Case No. 2:22-cv-00669 (W.D. Wash.). Surefield has filed a motion to dismiss or in the alternative transfer the case to the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The Company filed an opposition to the motion. On August 28, 2023, the Court denied Surefield s motion to dismiss the Washington case but stayed the action pending the resolution of the Texas case. On October 7, 2024, the Texas court appointed a technical advisor to assist the court with post-trial motions. 
 On July 24, 2024, Vinatha Kutagula, the Company s former Chief Customer Officer, filed a complaint against the Company in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Santa Clara alleging unlawful retaliation and wrongful termination. On September 13, 2024, the Company filed a motion to compel arbitration. On August 30, 2024, the Company received notice that Ms. Kutagula had filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Labor with similar allegations. The Company responded to the Department of Labor on October 17, 2024. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Our operating and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described under the section titled Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on February 27, 2024 and the updated risk factors described below, together with all of the other information in this report, including the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. The risks and uncertainties described in our 2023 Form 10-K and below are not the only ones that may impact our operating and financial results. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks or others not specified below actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected, which could result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock. 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors as previously disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, except as set forth below. The risk factors set forth below update, and should be read together with, the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Risk Factors Related to the Proposed CoStar Group Mergers 
 The proposed CoStar Group Mergers are subject to the satisfaction of closing conditions, including government approvals, some or all of which may not be satisfied or completed within the expected timeframe, if at all. 
 Completion of the CoStar Group Mergers is subject to a number of remaining closing conditions, including the expiration of the applicable waiting period (or extensions thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the receipt of approvals under specified antitrust and foreign investment laws; the absence of any law or order prohibiting the Mergers; the approval for listing on Nasdaq of the CoStar Group Shares to be issued in connection with the CoStar Group Mergers; and other customary closing conditions. We can provide no assurance that all required approvals will be obtained or that all closing conditions will otherwise be satisfied (or waived, if applicable), and, even if all required approvals can be obtained and all closing conditions are satisfied (or waived, if applicable), we can provide no assurance as to the terms, conditions and timing of such approvals or the timing of the completion of the CoStar Group Mergers. Certain of the conditions to the completion of the CoStar Group Mergers are not within our control, and we cannot predict when or if these conditions will be satisfied (or waived, if applicable). Any adverse consequence of the pending CoStar Group Mergers could be exacerbated by any delays in completion of the CoStar Group Mergers or a termination of the CoStar Group Merger Agreement. 
 Each party s obligation to consummate the CoStar Group Mergers is also subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party (subject to customary materiality qualifications) and compliance in all material respects with the covenants and agreements contained in the CoStar Group Merger Agreement as of the closing of the CoStar Group Mergers, including, with respect to us, covenants to conduct our business and operations in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and to not engage in certain kinds of material transactions prior to closing. In addition, the CoStar Group Merger Agreement may be terminated under certain specified circumstances, including, but not limited to, in connection with a change in the recommendation of our Board of Directors to enter into an agreement for a Superior Proposal (as defined in the CoStar Group Merger Agreement). The obligations of the financing parties are 
 58 

Table of Contents 

 subject to a number of customary conditions that must be satisfied prior to the completion of the CoStar Group Mergers. As a result, we cannot assure you that the CoStar Group Mergers will be completed, even though our stockholders approved the CoStar Group Merger Agreement, or that, if completed, the CoStar Group Mergers will be exactly on the terms set forth in the CoStar Group Merger Agreement or within the expected time frame. 
 We may not complete the proposed CoStar Group Mergers within the time frame we anticipate or at all, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price as well as our business, financial results and/or operations. 
 The proposed CoStar Group Mergers may not be completed within the expected timeframe, or at all, as a result of various factors and conditions, some of which may be beyond our control. If the CoStar Group Mergers are not completed for any reason, then our stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of our common stock in connection with the CoStar Group Mergers. Instead, we will remain a public company, our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and we will be required to continue to file periodic reports with the SEC. Moreover, our ongoing business may be materially adversely affected, and we would be subject to risks, including the following: 
 We may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including reactions that could have a negative impact on our stock price, and it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of the shares would return to the price at which the shares currently trade; 
 we may experience negative publicity, which could have an adverse effect on our ongoing operations including, but not limited to, retaining and attracting employees, customers, partners, suppliers and others with whom we do business; 
 we will be required to pay certain significant costs relating to the CoStar Group Mergers, such as legal, accounting, financial advisory, printing and other professional services fees, which may relate to activities that we would not have undertaken other than in connection with the CoStar Group Mergers; 
 we may be required to pay a cash termination fee to CoStar Group, as required under the CoStar Group Merger Agreement under certain circumstances; 
 while the CoStar Group Merger Agreement is in effect, we are subject to restrictions on our business activities, including, among other things, restrictions on our ability to enter into, modify, amend, renew or terminate certain kinds of material contracts, which could prevent us from pursuing strategic business opportunities, taking actions with respect to our business that we may consider advantageous and responding effectively and/or timely to competitive pressures and industry developments, and may as a result materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition; 
 matters relating to the CoStar Group Mergers require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management, which could result in the distraction of management from ongoing business operations and pursuing other opportunities that could have been beneficial to us; and 
 we may commit significant time and resources to defending against any litigation that may be filed related to the CoStar Group Mergers. 
 If the CoStar Group Mergers are not consummated, the risks described above may materialize, and they may have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial results and stock price; particularly to the extent that the current market price of our common stock reflects an assumption that the CoStar Group Mergers will be completed. 
 We will be subject to various business uncertainties while the CoStar Group Mergers are pending that may cause disruption. 
 Our efforts to complete the CoStar Group Mergers could cause disruptions in, and create uncertainty surrounding, our business, which may materially adversely affect our results of operation and our business. Uncertainty as to whether the CoStar Group Mergers will be completed may affect our ability to recruit prospective employees or to retain and motivate existing employees. Employee retention may be particularly challenging while the CoStar Group Mergers are pending because employees may experience uncertainty about their roles following the CoStar Group Mergers. A substantial amount of our management s and key employees attention is being directed toward the completion of the CoStar Group Mergers and thus is being diverted from our day-to-day operations. Uncertainty as to our future could adversely affect our business and our relationship with existing and potential customers, patients and suppliers. For example, customers, suppliers and other third parties may defer decisions concerning working with us or seek to change 
 59 

Table of Contents 

 existing business relationships with us. Changes to or termination of existing business relationships could adversely affect our revenue, earnings and financial condition, as well as the market price of our common stock. The adverse effects of the pendency of the CoStar Group Mergers could be exacerbated by any delays in completion of the CoStar Group Mergers or termination of the CoStar Group Merger Agreement. 
 The CoStar Group Merger Agreement may be terminated under various circumstances, including in connection with a superior proposal, and we would incur fees and expenses in connection with such termination. 
 Under the terms of the CoStar Group Merger Agreement, we may be required to pay CoStar Group a termination fee under specified conditions, including in the event the Company terminates the CoStar Group Merger Agreement to enter into a Superior Proposal (as defined in the CoStar Group Merger Agreement). This payment could affect the structure, pricing and terms proposed by a third party seeking to acquire or merge with us and could discourage a third party from making a competing acquisition proposal, including a proposal that would be more favorable to our stockholders than the CoStar Group Mergers. 
 We have incurred, and will continue to incur, direct and indirect costs as a result of the CoStar Group Mergers. 
 We have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs and expenses, including regulatory costs, fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the CoStar Group Mergers, for which we will have received little or no benefit if the CoStar Group Mergers are not completed. There are a number of factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of these costs and expenses. Many of these fees and costs will be payable by us even if the CoStar Group Mergers are not completed and may relate to activities that we would not have undertaken other than to complete the CoStar Group Mergers. 
 Litigation challenging the CoStar Group Mergers may increase costs and prevent the CoStar Group Mergers from being completed within the expected timeframe, or from being completed at all. 
 CoStar Group, Matterport and members of their respective boards of directors are currently and may in the future be parties to various claims and litigation related to the CoStar Group Merger Agreement or the CoStar Group Mergers. One of the conditions to completion of the CoStar Group Mergers is the absence of any injunction, order or award restraining or enjoining, or otherwise prohibiting, the consummation of the CoStar Group Mergers. Accordingly, if any complaint that has been or is subsequently filed challenging the CoStar Group Mergers and a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an order enjoining completion of the CoStar Group Mergers, then such order may prevent the CoStar Group Mergers from being completed, or from being completed within the expected time frame. 
 
 For example, on June 3, 2024, a purported Matterport stockholder filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned Andrew Rose v. Matterport, Inc., et al., Case No. 5:24-cv-3313 (the Rose Action ), naming Matterport and each member of the Matterport Board as defendants. The complaint alleged that CoStar Group s Form S-4 Registration Statement filed with the SEC on May 21, 2024 was materially misleading and omitted certain purportedly material information relating to the sales process, financial projections of Matterport and CoStar Group, the valuation analyses performed by Qatalyst Partners, and negotiations over the terms of post-transaction employment of certain Matterport employees. The complaint asserted violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder against all defendants, and violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the Company s Board. The complaint sought, among other things, an injunction enjoining consummation of the CoStar Group Mergers, an order directing the individual defendants to issue a new Registration Statement, and an award of plaintiff s costs of the action, including plaintiff s reasonable attorneys and experts fees. On August 6, 2024, the Rose Complaint was voluntarily dismissed. Additionally, on July 9 and July 11, 2024, purported Matterport stockholders filed complaints in the New York Supreme Court, captioned Hamilton v. Matterport, Inc., et al., Case No. 653458/2024 (the Hamilton Action and Scott v. Matterport, Inc., et al., Case No. 653515/2024 (the Scott Action ), respectively. These complaints name Matterport and each member of the Matterport Board as defendants and allege, inter alia, that the proxy statement misrepresents or omits certain purportedly material information relating to financial projections for Matterport, the valuation analyses performed by Qatalyst Partners, and potential conflicts of interest faced by Matterport insiders. The complaints assert claims for common law negligent misrepresentation and common law negligence. The complaint seeks, among other things, an injunction enjoining consummation of the CoStar Group Mergers, damages, and an award of plaintiff s costs of the action, including plaintiff s reasonable attorneys and experts fees. Additionally, the plaintiffs in an already-pending action in the Delaware Court of Chancery, captioned Hanna, et al. v. Pittman, et al., Case No. C.A. No. 2024-0088-LWW (the Hanna Action have filed an amended complaint, which alleges, inter alia, that the members of the Matterport Board breached their fiduciary duties by issuing a proxy statement which failed to disclose certain information concerning Matterport s prior issuance of certain earn-out shares previously issued and the subsequent impact on the amount of the CoStar Group Merger Consideration that would have been received by the plaintiffs and other stockholders 
 60 

Table of Contents 

 if those earn-out shares had not been issued. The amended complaint sought an injunction to enjoin the stockholder vote relating to the CoStar Group Mergers, and seeks, among other things, damages and an award of plaintiffs costs of the action, including reasonable attorneys and experts fees. The Plaintiffs in the Hanna Action have also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the stockholder vote and a motion for expedited proceedings regarding the motion for a preliminary injunction. On July 11, 2024, the court denied Plaintiffs motion to expedite. Additionally, certain purported Matterport stockholders have delivered demand letters (the Demands and a draft complaint alleging similar deficiencies or omissions regarding the disclosures made in the Registration Statement, and/or requesting relevant books and records. On July 25, 2024, one such purported Matterport stockholder filed suit in the Delaware Court of Chancery, captioned Layton v. Matterport, Inc., Case No. 2024-0792 (the Layton Action ). On July 29, 2024, the Delaware Court of Chancery stayed the action at the request of plaintiff s counsel during the pendency of the CoStar Group Mergers. Matterport notes that: (i) the Hanna Action, the Hamilton Action, the Scott Action, or the Layton Action may be amended; (ii) additional, similar complaints may be filed; or (iii) additional demand letters may be delivered. These events could prevent or delay completion of the CoStar Group Mergers and result in additional costs to Matterport. Matterport believes that the Rose Action, the Hanna Action, the Hamilton Action, the Scott Action, the Layton Action and the demand letters are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against them. Litigation could be time consuming and expensive, could divert the attention of CoStar Group s and Matterport s management away from their regular businesses, and, if adversely resolved against either CoStar Group or Matterport or their respective directors, could have a material adverse effect on CoStar Group s and Matterport s respective financial condition. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Common Stock 
 
 We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and if we are not able to remediate the material weakness, or if we identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to design and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, then we may be unable to accurately report our results of operations, meet our reporting obligations or prevent misstatements due to fraud or error. 
 As disclosed in Part 1, Item 4 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, management identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We have concluded that due to the material weakness, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in the reports required to be filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 If we fail to design and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, there could be material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements that we may not be able to prevent or detect on a timely basis and fail to meet our reporting obligations, which would likely cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. This could limit our access to capital markets, adversely affect our results of operations and lead to a decline in the trading price of the ordinary shares. Additionally, ineffective internal control over financial reporting could expose us to an increased risk of fraud or misappropriation of assets and subject us to potential delisting from the stock exchange on which we list or to other regulatory investigations and civil or criminal sanctions.

 Item 5. Other Information 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, no director or Section 16 officer of the Company or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K. 
 As noted in Item 4. Controls and Procedures above, management determined that the Company did not design and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures due to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as the Company did not design and maintain appropriate controls to ensure allegations received outside of the whistleblower program are evaluated and communicated to those responsible for financial reporting and those charged with governance in a timely fashion. Based upon the foregoing, management concluded on November 12, 2024, that this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness that existed as of December 31, 2023, March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024 and remains unremediated as of September 30, 2024. As of the date of this filing, the Company has determined that this material weakness did not result in a misstatement to the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 As a result, Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting included in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures of the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 should no longer be relied upon. The Company expects to file an amendment to its Annual Report on Form 10-K (the Form 10-K/A") for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 to include disclosures concerning this material weakness and to indicate that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of that date. In addition, the Form 10-K/A will include an amended report of our independent registered public accounting firm to reflect an adverse opinion related to the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. The Form 10-K/A will not contain any revision to the Company s previously issued consolidated financial statements.
