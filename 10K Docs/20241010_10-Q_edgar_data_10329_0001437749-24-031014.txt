NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-UNAUDITED

AUGUST 31, 2024

(Dollars in thousands except share and per share data)

and for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024, respectively. The effective rates for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024 differ from the federal statutory rate of primarily due to increases in the valuation allowance placed on deferred tax assets associated with Noa Home Inc. Noa Home ), the effects of state income taxes and various permanent differences. 

Our effective tax rate was and for the three and nine months ended August 26, 2023, respectively. The effective rates for the three and nine months ended August 26, 2023 differ from the federal statutory rate of primarily due to the non-taxable gain on revaluation of contingent consideration associated with the acquisition of Noa Home (see Note 9), increases in the valuation allowance placed on deferred tax assets associated with Noa Home and the effects of state income taxes and various permanent differences. 

Non-cash Investing and Financing Activity 

During the nine months ended August 31, 2024 and August 26, 2023, and , respectively, of lease right-of-use assets were added through the recognition of the corresponding lease obligations. 

and at August 31, 2024 and November 25, 2023, respectively, consisted of CDs. At August 31, 2024, the CDs had original terms averaging seven months, bearing interest at rates ranging from to and the weighted average remaining time to maturity was approximately five months and the weighted average yield of the CDs was approximately . Each CD is placed with a federally insured financial institution and all deposits are within federal deposit insurance limits. Due to the nature of these investments and their relatively short maturities, the carrying amount of the short-term investments at August 31, 2024 and November 25, 2023 approximates their fair value. 

Allowance for doubtful accounts 

Accounts receivable, net 

We maintain an allowance for credit losses for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. The allowance for credit losses is based on a review of specifically identified accounts in addition to an overall aging analysis which is applied to accounts pooled on the basis of similar risk characteristics. Judgments are made with respect to the collectability of accounts receivable within each pool based on historical experience, current payment practices and current economic trends based on our expectations over the expected life of the receivables, which is generally ninety days or less. Actual credit losses could differ from those estimates. 

Activity in the allowance for credit losses for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 was as follows: 

Additions charged to expense 

Write-offs against allowance 

Balance at August 31, 2024 

We believe that the carrying value of our net accounts receivable approximates fair value. The inputs into these fair value estimates reflect our market assumptions and are not observable. Consequently, the inputs are considered to be Level 3 as specified in the fair value hierarchy in ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures . 

Work in process 

Raw materials and supplies 

Retail merchandise 

Total inventories on first-in, first-out method 

LIFO adjustment 

Reserve for excess and obsolete inventory 

We estimate an inventory reserve for excess quantities and obsolete items based on specific identification and historical write-offs, taking into account future demand, market conditions and the respective valuations at LIFO. The need for these reserves is primarily driven by the normal product life cycle. As products mature and sales volumes decline, we rationalize our product offerings to respond to consumer tastes and keep our product lines fresh. If actual demand or market conditions in the future are less favorable than those estimated, additional inventory write-downs may be required. In determining reserves, we calculate separate reserves on our wholesale and retail inventories. Our wholesale inventories tend to carry the majority of the reserves for excess quantities and obsolete inventory due to the nature of our distribution model. These wholesale reserves primarily represent design and/or style obsolescence. Typically, product is not shipped to our retail warehouses until a consumer has ordered and paid a deposit for the product. We do not typically hold retail inventory for stock purposes. Consequently, floor sample inventory and inventory for delivery to customers account for the majority of our inventory at retail. Retail reserves are based on accessory and clearance floor sample inventory in our stores and any inventory that is not associated with a specific customer order in our retail warehouses. 

Activity in the reserves for excess quantities and obsolete inventory by segment are as follows: 

Additions charged to expense 

Write-offs 

Balance at August 31, 2024 

(1) 

Our estimates and assumptions have been reasonably accurate in the past. We have not made any significant changes to our methodology for determining inventory reserves in 2024 and do not anticipate that our methodology is likely to change in the future. 

Intangibles not subject to amortization: 

Trade names

Intangibles not subject to amortization:

See Note 9 regarding the impairment of the trade name intangible asset for Noa Home. 

 There were no changes in the carrying amounts of goodwill during the nine months ended August 31, 2024. 

The carrying amounts of goodwill by reportable segment, including accumulated impairment losses, at both August 31, 2024 and November 25, 2023 were as follows:

Total goodwill 

Amortization expense associated with intangible assets during the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024 and August 26, 2023 was as follows:

. At August 31, 2024, we had outstanding under standby letters of credit against our line. The line bears interest at the One-Month Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate One-Month Term SOFR plus and is secured by our accounts receivable and inventory. Our bank charges a fee of on the daily unused balance of the line, payable quarterly. Under the terms of the Credit Facility, Consolidated Minimum Tangible Net Worth (as defined in the Credit Facility) shall at no time be less than . In addition, we must maintain the following financial covenants, measured quarterly on a rolling twelve-month basis and commencing as of the end of the first fiscal quarter after the first date that the used commitment (the sum of any outstanding advances plus standby letters of credit) equals or exceeds : 

Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility) of not less than times and 

Consolidated Lease Adjusted Leverage to EBITDAR Ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility) not to exceed times. 

Since our used commitment was less than at August 31, 2024, we were not required to test the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or the Consolidated Lease Adjusted Leverage to EBITDAR Ratio. Had we been required to test those ratios, we would not have been able to achieve the required levels for either of these ratios. Consequently, our availability under the Credit Facility is currently limited to an additional 2,237. 

and as of August 31, 2024 and November 25, 2023, respectively. 

We also have the Bassett Furniture Industries, Incorporated Management Savings Plan (the Management Savings Plan which was established in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The Management Savings Plan is an unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plan maintained for the benefit of certain highly compensated or management level employees. As part of the Management Savings Plan, we have made Long Term Cash Awards LTC Awards totaling to five management employees in the amount of each. We are accounting for the LTC Awards as a defined benefit pension plan. Currently, two of those employees have retired and are receiving benefits. The liability for the LTC Awards was and as of August 31, 2024 and November 25, 2023, respectively. 

The combined pension liability for the Supplemental Plan and LTC Awards is recorded as follows in the condensed consolidated balance sheets: 

Post employment benefit obligations 

Total pension liability 

Components of net periodic pension costs for our defined benefit plans for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024 and August 26, 2023 are as follows: 

Interest cost 

Amortization of prior service costs 

Amortization of loss 

Net periodic pension cost 

The components of net periodic pension cost other than the service cost component, which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses, are included in other loss, net in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

Deferred Compensation Plans 

We have an unfunded deferred compensation plan that covers one current executive and certain former executives and provides for voluntary deferral of compensation. This plan has been frozen with no additional participants or deferrals permitted. Our liability under this plan was and as of August 31, 2024 and November 25, 2023, respectively. 

We also have an unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plan maintained for the benefit of certain highly compensated or management level employees which was established under the Management Savings Plan. Our liability under this plan, including both accrued Company contributions and participant salary deferrals, was and as of August 31, 2024 and November 25, 2023, respectively. 

Our combined liability for all deferred compensation arrangements, including Company contributions and participant deferrals under the Management Savings Plan, is recorded as follows in the condensed consolidated balance sheets: 

Post employment benefit obligations 

Total deferred compensation liability 

We recognized expense under our deferred compensation arrangements during the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024 and August 26, 2023 as follows: 

to accrue the remaining minimum charges payable under a contract for logistical services which our wholesale segment ceased utilizing during the third fiscal quarter of 2024. These minimum payments will continue through January of 2026. 

During the nine months ended August 31, 2024, we recognized non-cash charges for asset impairments totaling which consisted of the following: 

in our retail segment which included related to the impairment of leasehold improvements and from the impairment of right-of-use assets at certain underperforming retail stores, as well as for the impairment of right-of-use assets at certain warehouse locations resulting from the consolidation of our retail warehouses. 

for the impairment of plant and equipment in our wholesale segment related to the consolidation of our domestic wood production facilities. 

for the impairment of long-lived assets at Noa Home. During the second quarter we concluded that Noa Home was not likely to achieve profitability in the foreseeable future and have decided to cease operations by selling the remaining inventory in an orderly fashion over the next several months. of these charges are for the full impairment of the Noa Home trade name intangible asset, and relates to the full impairment of customized software used in the Noa Home operations. 

Our estimates of the fair value of the impaired right-of-use assets included estimates of discounted cash flows based upon current market rents and other inputs which we consider to be Level 3 inputs as specified in the fair value hierarchy in ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure. 

Fiscal 2023 

During the nine months ended August 26, 2023, we recognized a non-cash gain of resulting from the write-down of our contingent consideration obligation to the former owners of Noa Home. Subsequent to the acquisition of Noa Home on September 2, 2022, the parties concluded that the revenue and EBITDA targets originally set forth in the purchase agreement by which the Noa Home co-founders were to earn the contingent consideration were likely not to be met within the originally anticipated time frame and therefore agreed to replace the contingent consideration payable that was recognized at the acquisition date with two fixed payments of C each. The first payment was made in June of 2023 and the second payment will be made in December of 2024. 

and at August 31, 2024 and November 25, 2023, respectively. The remaining term under these lease guarantees extends for six years. 

In the event of default by the licensee, we believe that the risk of loss is mitigated through a combination of options that include, but are not limited to, arranging for a replacement licensee or liquidating the collateral (primarily inventory). The proceeds of the above options are expected to cover the estimated amount of our future payments under the guarantee obligation, net of recorded reserves. The fair value of these lease guarantees (an estimate of the cost to the Company to perform on the guarantee) at August 31, 2024 and November 25, 2023 was not material.

(Dollars in thousands except share and per share data)

Our fiscal year, which ends on the last Saturday of November, periodically results in a 53-week year instead of the normal 52 weeks. The current fiscal year ending November 30, 2024 is a 53-week year, with the additional week being included in our first fiscal quarter. Accordingly, the information presented below includes 40 weeks of operations for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 as compared to 39 weeks included in the quarter ended August 26, 2023. 

Overview 

Bassett is a leading retailer, manufacturer and marketer of branded home furnishings. Our products are sold primarily through a network of Company-owned and licensee-owned branded stores under the Bassett Home Furnishings BHF name, with additional distribution through other wholesale channels including multi-line furniture stores, many of which feature Bassett galleries or design centers. We also sell our products through our newly redesigned website at www.bassettfurniture.com . We were founded in 1902 and incorporated under the laws of Virginia in 1930. Our rich 122-year history has instilled the principles of quality, value, and integrity in everything we do, while simultaneously providing us with the expertise to respond to ever-changing consumer tastes and meet the demands of a global economy. 

With 87 BHF stores at August 31, 2024, we have leveraged our strong brand name in furniture into a network of Company-owned and licensed stores that focus on providing consumers with a friendly and casual environment for buying furniture and accessories. Our store program is designed to provide a single source home furnishings retail store that provides a unique combination of stylish, quality furniture and accessories with a high level of customer service. In order for the Bassett brand to reach markets that cannot be effectively served by our retail store network, we also distribute our products through other wholesale channels including multi-line furniture stores, many of which feature Bassett galleries or design centers. We use a network of over 30 independent sales representatives who have stated geographical territories. These sales representatives are compensated based on a standard commission rate. We believe this blended strategy provides us the greatest ability to effectively distribute our products throughout the United States and ultimately gain market share. 

The BHF stores feature custom order furniture, free in-home or virtual design visits home makeovers and coordinated decorating accessories. Our philosophy is based on building strong long-term relationships with each customer. Salespeople are referred to as Design Consultants and are trained to evaluate customer needs and provide comprehensive solutions for their home decor. Until a rigorous training and design certification program is completed, Design Consultants are not authorized to perform in-home or virtual design services for our customers. 

We consider our website to be the front door to our brand experience where customers can research our furniture and accessory offerings and subsequently buy online or engage with an in-store design consultant. Digital outreach strategies have become the primary vehicle for brand advertising and customer acquisition. We introduced a new web platform in August of 2023 that leverages world class features including enhanced customer research capabilities and streamlined navigation. Since the debut of the new site, we have seen increased engagement with the brand through a greater number of page views per customer along with more time spent on the site. We have also seen an increase in average order value that has resulted in increased e-commerce revenue. While we have made it easier to purchase on-line, we will not compromise our in-store experience or the quality of our in-home makeover capabilities. 

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 we acquired Noa Home, a mid-priced e-commerce furniture retailer headquartered in Montreal, Canada. Noa Home has operations in Canada, Singapore, the United States and the United Kingdom. After nearly two years of operating losses, we concluded during the second quarter of 2024 that Noa Home was not likely to achieve profitability at any time in the foreseeable future and have decided to cease operations by selling the inventory in an orderly fashion over the next several months. In the second quarter of 2024 we recognized non-cash charges totaling 2,401 related to the impairment of certain long-lived assets of Noa Home and the establishment of a reserve against Noa Home s remaining inventory. 

We have factories in Newton, North Carolina that manufacture both stationary and motion upholstered furniture for inside the home along with our outdoor furniture offerings. We also have factories in Martinsville and Bassett, Virginia that assemble and finish our custom bedroom and dining offerings. In 2022, we purchased a facility which we had formerly leased in Haleyville, Alabama where we manufacture aluminum frames for our outdoor furniture. 

In addition to the furniture that we manufacture domestically, we source most of our formal bedroom and dining room furniture (casegoods) and certain leather upholstery offerings from several foreign plants, primarily in Vietnam and China. Over 75 of our wholesale revenues are derived from products that are manufactured in the United States using a mix of domestic and globally sourced components and raw materials.

Retail Stores 

During the first quarter of 2024 we opened two new Corporate-owned stores located in Tampa, Florida and Houston, Texas. As of August 31, 2024, we had 58 Corporate-owned stores operating. One licensee-owned store in La Jolla, California was closed during the first quarter of 2024 and two licensee-owned stores in Seattle, Washington were closed during the third quarter of 2024. As of August 31, 2024 there were 29 licensee-owned stores in operation. 

Cybersecurity Incident 

On July 10, 2024, we detected unauthorized occurrences on a portion of our information technology (IT) systems. Upon detecting the unauthorized occurrences, we immediately began taking steps to contain, assess and remediate the cybersecurity incident, including beginning an investigation with leading external cybersecurity specialists, activating our incident response plan, and shutting down some systems. As a result of these and other measures, we believe the threat actor was ejected from our IT systems on July 10, 2024. 

After we shut down some of our systems, we experienced disruption to certain of our operations, including interrupted manufacturing at our domestic plants and delayed order fulfillment for our retail network and delay of some wholesale shipments. Within a few days of the incident, we were able to resume retail order fulfillment and caught up on fulfilling wholesale orders that were delayed as a result of the cybersecurity incident. We have fully restored the IT systems and data and our investigation has not found evidence that any of our core operating systems for manufacturing, wholesale and retail order processing and fulfillment, or financial reporting were impacted. 

While we believe the impacts were not material to our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year, we estimate that between 1,000 and 2,000 of sales were lost due to the shutdown during the cybersecurity incident. During the third quarter of 2024, we also incurred legal and remediation costs related to the incident of approximately 98 which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. In addition, cost of goods sold for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024 includes 609 for wages paid to hourly production employees during the work stoppage resulting from the cybersecurity incident. Because no inventory was produced during the temporary shutdown of our manufacturing operations, these wages were charged directly to expense. We will be seeking reimbursement of costs, expenses and losses stemming from the cybersecurity incident by submitting claims to our cybersecurity insurers. While the timing and amount of any such reimbursements is not known at this time, we are currently in the process of documenting our claim and expect to resolve the final amount during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2024.

40 weeks for fiscal 2024 as compared with 39 weeks for fiscal 2023. 

Analysis of Quarterly Results: 

Total sales revenue for the three months ended August 31, 2024 decreased 11,598 or 13 from the prior year period due primarily to a 16 decline in wholesale sales and a 10 decrease in retail sales through the Company-owned stores. In addition, we estimate that between 1,000 and 2,000 of sales were lost due to the shutdown during the cybersecurity incident. 

Gross margins for the three months ended August 31, 2024 increased 140 basis points over the prior year period primarily due to improved margins in both the retail and wholesale segments, partially offset by 609 of unproductive labor costs incurred during the temporary shutdown resulting from the cybersecurity incident. Excluding these unproductive labor costs, our consolidated gross margin would have been 53.8 . 

Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses as a percentage of sales for the three months ended August 31, 2024 increased 380 basis points from 2023 primarily due to the deleverage of fixed costs caused by lower sales volumes. 

Analysis of Year-to-Date Results: 

Total sales revenue for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 decreased 49,851 or 17 from the prior year period primarily due to a 18 decline in wholesale sales and a 15 decrease in retail sales through the Company-owned stores. 

Gross margins for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 increased 110 basis points over the prior year period. Included in the current year gross margin are increased inventory valuation charges of 1,729 in the wholesale segment, 472 in the retail segment and 500 in the Noa Home operation, and unproductive labor costs of 609 incurred during the temporary shutdown resulting from the cybersecurity incident. Excluding these charges, our consolidated gross margin would have been 55.0 . SG A expenses as a percentage of sales for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 increased 550 basis points from 2023 primarily due to the deleverage of fixed costs caused by lower sales volumes.

Segment Information 

We have strategically aligned our business into two reportable segments as defined in ASC 280, Segment Reporting , and as described below: 

Wholesale. The wholesale home furnishings segment is involved principally in the design, manufacture, sourcing, sale and distribution of furniture products to a network of Bassett stores (Company-owned and licensee-owned retail stores) and independent furniture retailers. Our wholesale segment includes our wood and upholstery operations, which includes Lane Venture. 

Retail Company-owned stores. Our retail segment consists of Company-owned stores and includes the revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and capital expenditures directly related to these stores and the Company-owned distribution network utilized to deliver products to our retail customers. 

In addition to the two reportable segments described above, we include our remaining business activities and assets in a reconciling category known as Corporate and other. This category includes the shared costs of corporate functions such as treasury and finance, information technology, accounting, human resources, legal and others, including certain product development and marketing functions benefitting both wholesale and retail operations. In addition to property and equipment and various other assets associated with the shared corporate functions, the identifiable assets of Corporate and other include substantially all of our cash and our investments in CDs. We consider our corporate functions to be other business activities and have aggregated them with any of our operating segments that do not meet the requirements to be reportable segments. As of and for the periods ended August 31, 2024 and August 26, 2023, the only such operating segment included in Corporate and other is Noa Home, which was acquired on September 2, 2022. All sales reported in our Corporate and other category are attributable to Noa Home, which generates substantially all of its sales outside of the United States. During the second quarter of 2024 we concluded that Noa Home was not likely to achieve profitability in the foreseeable future and decided to cease operations by selling the inventory in an orderly fashion over the next several months. 

Inter-company net sales elimination represents the elimination of wholesale sales to our Company-owned stores. Inter-company income elimination includes the embedded wholesale profit in the Company-owned store inventory that has not been realized. These profits will be recorded when merchandise is delivered to the retail consumer. The inter-company income elimination also includes rent paid by our retail stores occupying Company-owned real estate.

Reconciliation of Segment Results to Consolidated Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes 

To supplement the financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, we present gross profit by segment inclusive of the effects of intercompany sales by our wholesale segment to our retail segment. Because these intercompany transactions are not eliminated from our segment presentations and because we do not present gross profit as a measure of segment profitability in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, the presentation of gross profit by segment is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure. In addition, certain special gains or charges as well as non-operating income and expenses are included in consolidated income (loss) before income taxes are not included in the measures of segment profitability. The reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is presented below along with the effects of various other intercompany eliminations on our consolidated results of operations.

Analysis of Quarterly Results Wholesale 

Net sales for the three months ended August 31, 2024 decreased 8,832 or 16 from the prior year period due primarily to a 22 decrease in shipments to the open market, a 13 decrease in shipments to our retail store network and a 6 decrease in Lane Venture shipments. Gross margins for the three months ended August 31, 2024 increased 50 basis points over the prior year primarily due to the expected improvement in the Bassett Leather business. As the Bassett Leather product line is internationally sourced with extended lead times, we received significant amounts of inventory during the second and third quarters of 2022 just as product demand was weakening due to the market downturn in home furnishings. Also, the ocean freight costs associated with the majority of the product received was at significantly higher costs than are currently being realized on current product receipts. This improvement was partially offset by lower margins in the Bassett Custom Upholstery business due to deleverage of fixed costs from lower sales volumes and 609 of unproductive labor costs, or 1.3 of sales, incurred during the temporary shutdown resulting from the cybersecurity incident. SG A expenses as a percentage of sales increased 240 basis points primarily due to reduced leverage of fixed costs from decreased sales.

Analysis of Year-to-Date Results Wholesale 

Net sales for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 decreased 33,180 or 18 from the prior year period due primarily to a 20 decrease in shipments to the open market, a 17 decrease in shipments to our retail store network and a 9 decrease in Lane Venture shipments. Gross margins for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 increased 120 basis points over the prior year primarily due to the expected improvement in the Bassett Leather business. As the Bassett Leather product line is internationally sourced with extended lead times, we received significant amounts of inventory during the second and third quarters of 2022 just as product demand was weakening due to the market downturn in home furnishings. Also, the ocean freight costs associated with the majority of the product received was at significantly higher costs than are currently being realized on current product receipts. This increase was partially offset by significantly higher costs than are currently being realized on current product receipts. Margins in our Bassett Casegoods business also improved as expected primarily due to shipping more product that contained lower in-bound freight costs partially offset by increased inventory valuation charges as we plan to be more aggressive in selling certain slow-moving products. These improvements were partially offset by lower margins in the Bassett Custom Upholstery business due to deleverage of fixed costs from lower sales volumes. SG A expenses as a percentage of sales increased 220 basis points primarily due to reduced leverage of fixed costs from decreased sales.

Analysis of Quarterly Results - Retail 

Net sales for the three months ended August 31, 2024 decreased 5,008 or 9.6 from the prior year period. Written sales (the value of sales orders taken but not delivered) declined 4.8 from the third quarter of 2023. Gross margin for the three months ended August 31, 2024 improved 120 basis points over the prior period due to higher margins on both in-line and clearance goods. In addition, we were running two store closure sales in 2023 that reduced the gross margin for the third quarter of 2023. SG A expenses as a percentage of sales for the three months ended August 31, 2024 increased 150 basis points primarily due to decreased leverage of fixed costs from lower sales volumes partially offset by reduced advertising and fixed delivery costs. 

Analysis of Year-to-Date Results - Retail 

Net sales for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 decreased 26,526 or 15 from the prior year period. Written sales (the value of sales orders taken but not delivered) declined 3.6 from the first nine months of 2023. Gross margin for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 improved 80 basis points over the prior period primarily due to higher margins on both in-line and clearance goods partially offset by 472 of additional inventory valuation charges in the second quarter of 2024 due to our strategy to be more aggressive in selling clearance goods to better control inventory levels. SG A expenses as a percentage of sales for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 increased 480 basis points primarily due to decreased leverage of fixed costs from lower sales volumes.

In addition to the two reportable segments discussed above, we include our remaining business activities and assets in a reconciling category known as Corporate and other, which includes the shared costs of various corporate functions along with any operating segments that do not meet the requirements to be reportable segments. Therefore, Noa Home is included within the Corporate and other reconciling category and accounts for all of the sales and gross profit within this reconciling category.

Analysis of Quarterly Results Corporate and Other 

Sales and gross profit declined from the prior year period as we began our wind-down of Noa Home s operations and continued to sell the remaining inventory over the next several months. The 888 decrease in SG A expenses was primarily due to reduced advertising and warehouse costs for Noa Home as a result of the on-going wind-down of operations and decreased corporate overhead spending from better expense management, partially offset by costs incurred in connection with the cybersecurity incident. 

Analysis of Year-to-Date Results Corporate and Other 

Sales and gross profit declined from the prior year period as we began our wind-down of Noa Home s operations and continued to sell the remaining inventory over the next several months. Included in the gross profit is an inventory valuation charge of 500 recognized during the second quarter of 2024 due to our decision to cease operations at Noa Home. The 2,777 decrease in SG A expenses was primarily due to decreased advertising and warehouse costs for Noa Home as a result of the on-going wind-down of operations and decreased corporate overhead spending from better expense management. 

Other Gains and Losses 

Fiscal 2024 

During the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024, we recognized a charge of 1,240 to accrue the remaining minimum charges under a logistical services contract with a vendor in Riverside, California. We ceased utilizing those services during the third quarter of 2024 and expect to pay the minimum monthly charge through January of 2026. 

During the nine months ended August 31. 2024, we recognized non-cash charges for asset impairments totaling 5,515 which consisted of the following: 

2,887 in our retail segment which included 1,978 related to the impairment of leasehold improvements and 750 from the impairment of right-of-use assets at certain underperforming retail stores, as well as 159 for the impairment of right-of-use assets at certain warehouse locations resulting from the consolidation of our retail warehouses. 

727 for the impairment of plant and equipment in our wholesale segment related to the consolidation of our domestic wood production facilities. 

1,901 for the impairment of long-lived assets at Noa Home. During the second quarter we concluded that Noa Home was not likely to achieve profitability in the foreseeable future and decided to cease operations by selling the remaining inventory in an orderly fashion over the next several months. 1,827 of these charges are for the full impairment of the Noa Home trade name intangible asset, and 74 relates to the full impairment of customized software used in the Noa Home operations.

(Dollars in thousands except share and per share data)

Fiscal 2023 

During the nine months ended August 26, 2023, we recognized a non-cash gain of 1,013 resulting from the write-down of our contingent consideration obligation to the former owners of Noa Home. Subsequent to the acquisition of Noa Home on September 2, 2022, the parties concluded that the revenue and EBITDA targets originally set forth in the purchase agreement by which the Noa Home co-founders were to earn the contingent consideration were likely not to be met within the originally anticipated time frame and therefore agreed to replace the contingent consideration payable that was recognized at the acquisition date with two fixed payments of C 200 each. The first payment was made in June of 2023 and the second payment will be made in December of 2024. 

Other Items Affecting Net Income (Loss) 

Interest Income 

Interest income for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024 was 692 and 2,075, respectively, compared to 923 and 1,644 for the three and nine months, respectively, ended August 26, 2023. The third quarter decline from the prior year period is primarily due to lower balances of interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents, while for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 the rates earned on our cash and cash equivalents and investments in CDs averaged higher than the preceding year. 

Other Loss, Net 

Other loss, net, for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024 was 276 and 380, respectively, compared to 505 and 1,072 for the three and nine months, respectively, ended August 26, 2023. The net change from the prior year periods was primarily due to lower costs associated with Company-owned life insurance. 

Income Taxes 

We calculate an anticipated effective tax rate for the year based on our annual estimates of pretax income or loss and use that effective tax rate to record our year-to-date income tax provision. Any change in annual projections of pretax income or loss could have a significant impact on our effective tax rate for the respective quarter. 

Our effective tax rate was 22.0 and 17.3 for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024, respectively. The effective rates for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024 differ from the federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to increases in the valuation allowance placed on deferred tax assets associated with Noa Home, the effects of state income taxes and various permanent differences. 

Our effective tax rate was 18.8 and 43.3 for the three and nine months ended August 26, 2023, respectively. The effective rates for the three and nine months ended August 26, 2023 differ from the federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to the non-taxable gain on revaluation of contingent consideration associated with the acquisition of Noa Home, increases in the valuation allowance placed on deferred tax assets associated with Noa Home and the effects of state income taxes and various permanent differences. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Cash Flows 

Cash used in operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was 2,323 compared to cash provided by operations of 10,249 for the first nine of fiscal 2023, representing a decrease of 12,572 in cash flows from operations. This decrease was primarily the result of changes in working capital due to the timing impact of expenditures as a result of an additional week in the first quarter of 2024 coupled with lower net income. 

Our overall cash position declined 14,078 during the first nine months of 2024. During the first nine months of fiscal 2024, we spent 4,720 on purchases of property and equipment primarily consisting of the upfit of the new Tampa, Florida and Houston, Texas stores that opened in the first quarter of 2024, final payments on the Austin, Texas store remodel, update of the fa ade of the Greensboro, North Carolina store location and expenditures related to various information technology and manufacturing plant projects. We also paid 4,909 in dividends during the first nine months of 2024. During the second quarter of 2024 we resumed purchasing shares under our stock repurchase program and repurchased 1,127 during the first nine months of 2024 compared to 4,056 repurchased in the prior year period. We expect capital expenditures for the full year to range from 6 million to 8 million. As of August 31, 2024, 20,696 remains available for future purchases under our stock repurchase plan. With cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling 56,163 on hand at August 31, 2024, expected future operating cash flows and the availability under our credit line noted below, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund operations for the foreseeable future.

Debt and Other Obligations 

On May 15, 2024, we entered into the Credit Facility with our bank. This credit facility provides for a line of credit of up to 25,000. At August 31, 2024, we had 6,013 outstanding under standby letters of credit against our line. The line bears interest at the One-Month Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate One-Month Term SOFR plus 1.75 and is secured by our accounts receivable and inventory. Our bank charges a fee of 0.25 on the daily unused balance of the line, payable quarterly. Under the terms of the Credit Facility, Consolidated Minimum Tangible Net Worth shall at no time be less than 120,000. In addition, we must maintain the following financial covenants, measured quarterly on a rolling twelve-month basis and commencing as of the end of the first fiscal quarter after the first date that the used commitment (the sum of any outstanding advances plus standby letters of credit) equals or exceeds 8,250: 

Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of not less than 1.2 times and 

Consolidated Lease Adjusted Leverage to EBITDAR Ratio not to exceed 3.35 times. 

Since our used commitment was less than 8,250 at August 31, 2024, we were not required to test the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or the Consolidated Lease Adjusted Leverage to EBITDAR Ratio. Had we been required to test those ratios, we would not have been able to achieve the required levels for either ratio. Consequently, our availability under the Credit Facility is currently limited to an additional 2,237. 

We lease land and buildings that are used in the operation of our Company-owned retail stores as well as in the operation of one of our licensee-owned stores, and we lease land and buildings used in our wholesale manufacturing operations. We also lease local delivery trucks used in our retail segment. The present value of our obligations for leases with terms in excess of one year at August 31, 2024 is 104,133 and is included in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet at August 31, 2024. We were contingently liable under licensee lease obligation guarantees in the amount of 5,226 at August 31, 2024. The remaining terms under these lease guarantees extend for six years. See Note 10 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding our lease guarantees. 

Investment in Retail Real Estate 

We have a substantial investment in real estate acquired for use as retail locations and occupied by Company-owned retail stores. Such real estate is included in property and equipment, net, in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets and consists of eight properties with an aggregate square footage of 203,465 and a net book value of 24,306 at August 31, 2024. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from the information provided in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 25, 2023. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We utilize stand-by letters of credit in the procurement of certain goods in the normal course of business. In addition, we have guaranteed certain lease obligations of licensee operators for some of their store locations. See Note 9 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of lease guarantees, including descriptions of the terms of such commitments and methods used to mitigate risks associated with these arrangements.

Contingencies 

We are involved in various legal and environmental matters which arise in the normal course of business. Although the final outcome of these matters cannot be determined, based on the facts presently known, it is our opinion that the final resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations. See Note 10 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information regarding certain contingencies as of August 31, 2024. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk: 

We are exposed to market risk from changes in the value of foreign currencies. Substantially all of our imports purchased outside of North America are denominated in U.S. dollars. Therefore, we believe that gains or losses resulting from changes in the value of foreign currencies relating to foreign purchases not denominated in U.S. dollars would not be material to our results from operations in fiscal 2024. We are also exposed to foreign currency market risk through our investment in Noa Home. Our investment in Noa Home is subject to changes in the value of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar. Additionally, Noa Home is exposed to other local currency fluctuation risk through its operations in Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United States. The impact of currency fluctuations on our financial position and results of operations of Noa Home has not been significant. 

We are exposed to market risk from changes in the cost and availability of raw materials used in our manufacturing processes, principally wood, woven fabric, and foam products. The cost of foam products, which are petroleum-based, is sensitive to changes in the price of oil. 

We are also exposed to commodity price risk related to diesel fuel prices for fuel used in our retail segment for home delivery as well as through amounts we are charged for logistical services by our service providers. We manage our exposure to that risk primarily through the application of fuel surcharges to our customers. 

We have potential exposure to market risk related to conditions in the commercial real estate market. Our retail real estate holdings of 24,306 at August 31, 2024 for Company-owned stores could suffer significant impairment in value if we are forced to close additional stores and sell or lease the related properties during periods of weakness in certain markets. Additionally, if we are required to assume responsibility for payment under the lease obligations of 5,226 which we have guaranteed on behalf of certain licensees as of August 31, 2024 we may not be able to secure sufficient sub-lease income in the current market to offset the payments required under the guarantees. We are also exposed to risk related to conditions in the commercial real estate rental market with respect to the right-of-use assets we carry on our balance sheet for leased retail store locations, manufacturing and warehouse facilities. At August 31, 2024, the unamortized balance of such right-of-use assets used in continuing operations totaled 90,076. Should we have to close or otherwise abandon one of these leased locations, we could incur additional impairment charges if rental market conditions do not support a fair value for the right of use asset in excess of its carrying value. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures: 

The Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have evaluated the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon their evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective. There has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the Company s most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

None 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

We discuss in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 25, 2023 various risks that may materially affect our business. We use this section to update this discussion to reflect material developments since our Form 10-K was filed. 

We rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Disruptions in both our primary and back-up systems could adversely affect our business and operating results. 

Our primary and back-up computer systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, natural disasters and errors by employees. Though losses arising from some of these issues would be covered by insurance, interruptions of our critical business computer systems or failure of our back-up systems could reduce our sales or result in longer production times. If our critical business computer systems or back-up systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them. For example, we disclosed a cybersecurity incident in Item 1.05 of Current Reports on Form 8-K and 8-K/A filed on July 15, 2024 and August 6, 2024, respectively, relating to the detection of unauthorized occurrences on a portion of our information technology (IT) systems.
