 EXPLANATORY NOTE 
 This report combines the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2024 of Brandywine Realty Trust (the Parent Company and Brandywine Operating Partnership L.P. (the Operating Partnership ). The Parent Company is a Maryland real estate investment trust, or REIT, that owns its assets and conducts its operations through the Operating Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership, and subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership. The Parent Company, the Operating Partnership and their consolidated subsidiaries are collectively referred to in this report as the Company . In addition, as used in this report, terms such as we , us , and our may refer to the Company, the Parent Company, or the Operating Partnership. 
 The Parent Company is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and, as of September 30, 2024, owned a 99.7 interest in the Operating Partnership. The remaining 0.3 interest consists of common units of limited partnership interest issued by the Operating Partnership to third parties in exchange for contributions of properties to the Operating Partnership. As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, the Parent Company has full and complete authority over the Operating Partnership s day-to-day operations and management. 
 Management operates the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership as one enterprise. The management of the Parent Company consists of the same members as the management of the Operating Partnership. 
 As general partner with control of the Operating Partnership, the Parent Company consolidates the Operating Partnership for financial reporting purposes, and the Parent Company does not have significant assets other than its investment in the Operating Partnership. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements. The separate discussions of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership in this report should be read in conjunction with each other to understand the results of the Company s operations on a consolidated basis and how management operates the Company. 
 The Company believes that combining the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership into a single report will: 
 facilitate a better understanding by the investors of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership by enabling them to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business; 
 remove duplicative disclosures and provide a more straightforward presentation in light of the fact that a substantial portion of the disclosure applies to both the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership; and 
 create time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports. 
 There are few differences between the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, which are reflected in the footnote disclosures in this report. The Company believes it is important to understand the differences between the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership in the context of how these entities operate as an interrelated consolidated company. The Parent Company is a REIT, whose only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of the Operating Partnership. As a result, the Parent Company does not conduct business itself, other than acting as the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, issuing equity from time to time (and contributing the net proceeds of such issuances to the Operating Partnership) and guaranteeing the debt obligations of the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership holds substantially all the assets of the Company, including the Company s ownership interests in the real estate ventures described below. The Operating Partnership conducts the operations of the Company s business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity. Except for net proceeds from equity issuances by the Parent Company, which are contributed to the Operating Partnership in exchange for partnership units, the Operating Partnership generates the capital required by the Company s business through the Operating Partnership s operations, by the Operating Partnership s incurrence of indebtedness (directly and through subsidiaries) and through the issuance of partnership units of the Operating Partnership or equity interests in subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership. 
 The equity and non-controlling interests in the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership s equity are the main areas of difference between the consolidated financial statements of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership. The common units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership are accounted for as partners equity in the Operating Partnership s financial statements while the common units of limited partnership interests held by parties other than the Parent Company are presented as non-controlling interests in the Parent Company s financial statements. The differences between the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership s equity relate to the differences in the equity issued at the Parent Company and Operating Partnership levels.

Table of Contents 

 To help investors understand the differences between the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, this report presents the following as separate notes or sections for each of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership: 
 Consolidated Financial Statements; and 
 Notes to the Parent Company s and Operating Partnership s Equity. 
 This report also includes separate Item 4. (Controls and Procedures) disclosures and separate Exhibit 31 and 32 certifications for each of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership in order to establish that the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of each entity have made the requisite certifications and that the Parent Company and Operating Partnership are compliant with Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and 18 U.S.C. 1350. 
 In order to highlight the differences between the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, the separate sections in this report for the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership specifically refer to the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership. In the sections that combine disclosures of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, this report refers to such disclosures as those of the Company. Although the Operating Partnership is generally the entity that directly or indirectly enters into contracts and real estate ventures and holds assets and incurs debt, reference to the Company is appropriate because the business is one enterprise and the Parent Company operates the business through the Operating Partnership.

Glossary 
 
 Defined terms used in this Report: 
 
 Average annual rent 
 Represents total initial contractual rental rate under the applicable leases (as impacted by free rent) plus contractual fixed rent increases due under the applicable leases averaged over the total terms (without regard to extension options) of the applicable leases. For comparison purposes, the Company excludes new leases of space when the previous lease of such space ended more than 12 months prior to the signing date for the new leases. 
 Core Portfolio/Core Properties 
 Includes all wholly-owned operating properties. 
 Funds From Operations (FFO) 
 Is a non-GAAP financial measure,which the Company believes is useful to investors. The Company computes FFO in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), which may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not compute FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, or that interpret the NAREIT definition differently than the Company. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (loss) before noncontrolling interests of unitholders (preferred and common) and excluding gains (losses) on sales of depreciable operating property, impairment losses on depreciable consolidated real estate, impairment losses on investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures and extraordinary items (computed in accordance with GAAP); plus real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs), and after adjustment for unconsolidated real estate ventures. Net income, the GAAP measure that the Company believes to be most directly comparable to FFO, includes depreciation and amortization expenses, gains or losses on property sales and noncontrolling interests. FFO per share is calculated by dividing FFO by fully diluted shares available to common shareholders and limited partnership unitholders. See Management s 
 Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 2 of this 
 Report for a reconciliation of net income attributable to common shares and common 
 unitholders to FFO. 
 Net Operating Income (NOI) 
 Is a non-GAAP financial measure, which the Company defines as total property revenue less property operating expenses, real estate taxes and third-party management expenses. Property operating expenses that are included in determining NOI consist of costs that are necessary and allocable to our operating properties such as utilities, property-level salaries, repairs and maintenance, property insurance and management fees. General and administrative expenses that are not reflected in NOI primarily consist of corporate-level salaries, amortization of share awards and professional fees that are incurred as part of corporate office management. NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure that we report because we believe it is useful to our investors. See Note 13, Segment Information, to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of NOI to our consolidated net income as defined by GAAP. 
 Rental Rate 
 Includes base rent plus reimbursement for operating expenses and real estate taxes. 
 Same Store Properties 
 We refer to properties acquired or placed in-service prior to the beginning of the earliest period presented and owned by us through the end of the latest period presented as Same Store Properties. Same Store Properties therefore exclude properties placed in-service, acquired, repositioned, held for sale or in development or redevelopment after the beginning of the earliest period presented or disposed of prior to the end of the latest period presented. Accordingly, it takes at least one year and one quarter after a property is acquired for that property to be included in Same Store Properties.

 Net operating income NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure, which we define as total property revenue less property operating expenses, real estate taxes and third-party management expenses. Property operating expenses that are included in determining NOI consist of costs that are necessary and allocable to our operating properties such as utilities, property-level salaries, repairs and maintenance, property insurance and management fees. General and administrative expenses that are not reflected in NOI primarily consist of corporate-level salaries, amortization of share awards and professional fees that are incurred as part of corporate office management. NOI presented by the Company may not be comparable to NOI reported by other companies that define NOI differently. NOI is the primary measure that is used by the Company s management to evaluate the operating performance of the Company s real estate assets by segment. The Company believes NOI provides useful information to investors regarding the financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. While NOI is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. NOI does not reflect interest expenses, real estate impairment losses, depreciation and amortization costs, capital expenditures and leasing costs. The Company believes that net income (loss), as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure.

In the event that costs are incurred before a construction loan has been obtained, the Company expects to fund such costs through its credit facilities and cash on hand. 
 With respect to the One Uptown Ventures, the Company has provided completion guarantees and environmental indemnities in favor of its partner. In addition, the Company has provided completion guarantees, environmental indemnities and guarantees of exceptions to nonrecourse loan provisions in favor of the lenders for the One Uptown Ventures. Moreover, the Company has provided, in favor of the lenders, carry guarantees and limited payment guarantees up to and of the principal balance of the million (office) and million (multifamily) construction loans, respectively. 
 The Company has agreed, pursuant to the leasehold mortgage loan to the New MAP Venture, to fund up to an additional million for tenant and capital improvements pursuant to leases that the Company proposes, in its discretion, to enter into at the properties owned (through leasehold interests) by the New MAP Venture, which amounts, when funded, will accrue interest at per annum. 
 The Company has agreed to contribute and has subsequently funded million to the Commerce Square Venture in November 2024. See Note 4 Investment in Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures, for further information. 
 Impact of Natural Disasters and Casualty 
 The Company carries liability insurance to mitigate its exposure to certain losses, including those relating to property damage. The Company records the estimated amount of expected insurance proceeds for property damage and other losses incurred as an asset (typically a receivable from the insurer) and income up to the amount of the losses incurred when receipt of insurance proceeds is deemed probable. Any amount of insurance recovery in excess of the amount of the losses is considered a gain contingency and is not recorded until the proceeds are received. 
 Other Commitments or Contingencies 
 In connection with the Schuylkill Yards Project, the Company entered into a neighborhood engagement program and, as of September 30, 2024, had million of future fixed contractual obligations. The Company also committed to fund additional contributions under the program. As of September 30, 2024, the Company estimates that these additional contributions, which are not fixed under the terms of agreement, will be million. 
 The Company has committed to contribute million to a venture capital fund that invests in early-stage life science companies. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had funded million of the foregoing commitment. 
 The Company invests in its p roperties and regularly incurs capital expenditures in the ordinary course of business to maintain the properties. The Company believes that such expenditures enhance its competitiveness. The Company also enters into construction, utility and service contracts in the ordinary course of business which may extend beyond one year. These contracts typically provide for cancellation with insignificant or no cancellation penalties.

We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe-harbor provisions of the 1995 Act. The words anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, intend, will, should and similar expressions, as they relate to us, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be achieved. As forward-looking statements, these statements involve important risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expected results and, accordingly, such results may differ from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. Factors that might cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations are set forth in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in Part II, Item 1A of our Quarterly Report on From 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. Accordingly, we caution readers not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.

 The discussion that follows is based primarily on our consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and should be read along with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report. The ability to compare one period to another may be significantly affected by acquisitions completed, development/redevelopment properties placed in service and dispositions made during those periods. 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we owned and managed properties within four segments: (1) Philadelphia CBD, (2) Pennsylvania Suburbs, (3) Austin, Texas, and (4) Other. The Philadelphia CBD segment includes properties located in the City of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania Suburbs segment includes properties in Chester, Delaware and Montgomery counties in the Philadelphia suburbs. The Austin, Texas segment includes properties in the City of Austin, Texas. The Other segment includes properties located in the District of Columbia, Northern Virginia, Southern Maryland, Camden County, New Jersey and New Castle County, Delaware. In addition to the four segments, our corporate group is responsible for cash and investment management, development/redevelopment of certain properties during the construction period, and certain other general support functions. 
 Our financial condition and operating performance are dependent upon the demand for office, residential, life science, parking and retail space in our markets, our leasing results, our acquisition, disposition and development/redevelopment activity, our financing activity, our cash requirements and economic and market conditions, including prevailing interest rates. 
 We generate cash and revenue from leases of space at our Properties and, to a lesser extent, from the management and development/redevelopment of properties owned by third parties (primarily unconsolidated real estate ventures) and from investments in the unconsolidated real estate ventures. Factors that we evaluate when leasing space include rental rates, costs of tenant improvements, tenant creditworthiness, current and expected operating costs, the length of the lease term, vacancy levels and demand for space. We also generate cash through sales of assets, including assets that we do not view as core to our business plan, either because of location or expected growth potential, and assets that are commanding premium prices from third party investors. 
 Overall macroeconomic conditions, including but not limited to inflation and high interest rates and changes in work patterns, including remote working arrangements, that have contributed to negative lease absorption within our office markets, have had a dampening effect on the fundamentals of our business, as reflected in, among other metrics, our increased borrowing costs and lower occupancy as well as downward pressures on asset valuations. These adverse conditions could continue to impact our net income, cash flows and liquidity and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Notwithstanding the challenging macroeconomic conditions, which have contributed to recent difficulties in asset dispositions at acceptable prices, leasing of vacant space at attractive rents and sourcing of capital for development projects at acceptable costs, as well as to impairments of assets, we believe that our portfolio or Properties and investments, and liquidity profile, will allow us to maintain stable operating performance. In our ongoing assessment of our Properties we consider both their quantitative and qualitative attributes, including in relation to other properties within a given submarket or adjacent submarkets that compete with our portfolio for tenants. The attributes that we consider in our assessment include the age and condition of the property, average asking rental rates, access to mass transit and highways, floorplate efficiencies, amenities within, and 
 33

 nearby, the property and availability of parking as well as market demographics such that bear on demand for space at our portfolio. We also believe that our portfolio and liquidity profile will enable us to raise capital, as necessary, in various forms and from different sources, including through secured or unsecured loans from banks, pension funds and life insurance companies. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to borrow funds on terms that are economically attractive or at all. 
 We continue to seek revenue growth throughout our portfolio by increasing occupancy and rental rates. Occupancy at our Core Properties at September 30, 2024 was 87.2 compared to 88.3 at September 30, 2023. 
 The table below summarizes selected operating and leasing statistics of our Core Properties for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Leasing Activity Core Properties (1): Total net rentable square feet owned 12,176,827 12,598,531 12,176,827 12,598,531 Occupancy percentage (end of period) 87.2 88.3 87.2 88.3 Average occupancy percentage 87.3 88.8 87.8 89.1 Total Portfolio, less properties in development/redevelopment (2): Tenant retention rate (3) 42.0 44.1 60.9 50.8 New leases and expansions commenced (square feet) 72,962 59,750 327,947 219,216 Leases renewed (square feet) 102,254 115,633 496,232 338,378 Net (negative) absorption (square feet) (68,481) (145,408) (160,949) (236,384) Percentage change in rental rates per square foot (4): New and expansion rental rates 18.0 19.8 21.1 Renewal rental rates 14.3 2.8 12.5 11.8 Combined rental rates 14.9 2.8 13.9 13.6 Weighted average lease term for leases commenced (years) 6.2 6.0 6.2 6.9 Average annual rent (per square foot) (7) (8)

 (1) Does not include Properties under development/redevelopment, or recently completed not-stabilized Properties. 
 (2) Includes leasing at recently completed not-stabilized Properties. The statistics presented for periods ended prior to the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 have not been adjusted for properties sold subsequent to the periods presented. 
 (3) Calculated as percentage of total net rentable square feet. 
 (4) Includes base rent plus reimbursement for operating expenses and real estate taxes. 
 (5) Calculated on a weighted average basis. 
 (6) The increases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are primarily due to leases having a higher average lease terms and a higher percentage of new leases compared to renewals. 
 (7) For comparison purposes, we exclude new leases of space when the previous lease of such space ended more than 12 months prior to the signing date for the new leases. 
 (8) Average annual rent represents total initial contractual rent under the applicable leases plus contractual fixed rent increases due under the applicable leases averaged over the total terms of the applicable leases. 
 
 Our actual leasing capital costs as a percentage of rents are largely a function of the composition of our leases to new tenants or renewals with existing tenants, in addition to size and timing of occupancy. We generally experience lower leasing costs in connection with the renewal of leases with existing tenants compared to leases with new tenants. Our properties compete for tenants with similar properties primarily on the basis of location, total occupancy costs (including base rent and operating expenses), services and amenities, and the design and condition of the properties. As leases at our properties expire, we face competition to renew or re-let space in light of the competing properties within the applicable markets. As a result, and as part of customary lease negotiations, we are often required to provide rent concessions or abatements, incur charges for tenant

 improvements and other inducements, including early termination rights or potential below market renewal options, all of which impact, in varying degrees, annualized rents.

 (3) Does not include Properties under development/redevelopment. 
 (4) See Note 13 Segment Information, to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the definition of Net Operating Income. 
 In seeking to increase revenue through our operating, financing and investment activities, we also seek to minimize operating risks, including (i) tenant rollover risk, (ii) tenant credit risk and (iii) development risk. 
 
 We have compared our weighted-average in-place rental rates to our leases signed in 2024 and our current market leasing assumptions, and while the actual results will be dependent on the leases expiring in any particular period, we believe the current portfolio should generate positive rental rate increases for the remainder of fiscal 2024. 
 Tenant Rollover Risk 
 We are subject to the risk that tenant leases, upon expiration, will not be renewed, that space may not be relet, or that the terms of renewal or reletting (including the cost of renovations) may be less favorable to us than the current lease terms. Leases that accounted for approximately 0.8 of our total square footage as of September 30, 2024 (representing approximately 0.9 of the occupied rentable square feet of the properties) are scheduled to expire without penalty during the remainder of 2024. We maintain an active dialogue with our tenants in an effort to maximize lease renewals. If we are unable to renew leases or relet space under expiring leases, at anticipated rental rates, or if our tenants terminate their leases early, our cash flow would be adversely impacted. 
 Tenant Credit Risk 
 In the event of a tenant default, we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as a landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment. Our management evaluates our accrued rent receivable reserve policy in light of our tenant base and general and local economic conditions. Our accrued rent receivable allowance was 1.3 million or 0.7 of our accrued rent 
 35 

Table of Contents 

 receivable balance as of September 30, 2024, compared to 2.7 million or 1.4 of our accrued rent receivable balance as of December 31, 2023. 
 If economic conditions deteriorate, including as a result of inflation and rising interest rates, we may experience increases in past due accounts, defaults, lower occupancy and reduced effective rents. These conditions would negatively affect our future net income and cash flows and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. 
 Development and Redevelopment Risk 
 Development and Redevelopment projects are subject to a variety of risks, including construction delays, construction cost overruns, building moratoriums, inability to obtain financing on favorable terms, inability to lease space at projected rates, inability to enter into construction, development, redevelopment and other agreements on favorable terms, and unexpected environmental and other hazards. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the following development project, within our consolidated portfolio, remains under construction in progress (dollars, in thousands):

 (b) The development budget contemplated receipt of a construction loan of approximately 174.3 million, reflecting a 55 loan to value ratio and, as of the date of this Form 10-Q, no construction loan has been obtained and there can be no assurance that a loan will be obtained. In the event that costs are incurred before a construction loan has been obtained, the Company expects to fund such costs through its credit facilities and cash on hand. 
 As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the 3151 Market Street Venture has not secured a construction loan. Under the partnership agreement with our partner in this real estate venture, after our partner has funded the remaining balance of its capital commitment, as shown in the table above, then, until a construction loan has been obtained, we will be obligated to fund the balance of construction costs incurred in the project development. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discuss our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Certain accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies, as they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and changes in accounting estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and current economic conditions. 
 Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 contains a discussion of our critical accounting policies. There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies since December 31, 2023.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion is based on our consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. We believe that presentation of our consolidated financial information, without a breakdown by segment, will effectively present important information useful to our investors. 
 Net operating income NOI as presented in the comparative analysis below is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as total revenue less property operating expenses, real estate taxes and third party management expenses. Property operating expenses that are included in determining NOI consist of costs that are necessary and allocable to our operating properties such as utilities, property-level salaries, repairs and maintenance, property insurance, and management fees. General and administrative expenses that are not reflected in NOI primarily consist of corporate-level salaries, amortization of share awards and professional fees that are incurred as part of corporate office management. NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure that we use internally to evaluate the operating performance of our real estate assets by segment, as presented in Note 13 Segment Information, to our consolidated financial statements, and of our business as a whole. We believe NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. While NOI is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. NOI does not reflect interest expenses, real estate impairment losses, depreciation and amortization costs, capital expenditures and leasing costs. We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. See Note 13 Segment Information, to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of NOI to our consolidated net income as defined by GAAP. 
 Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 The following comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2024 to the three months ended September 30, 2023 makes reference to the effect of the following: 
 (a) Same Store Property Portfolio, which represents 63 properties containing an aggregate of approximately 11.9 million net rentable square feet, and represents properties that we owned and consolidated for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Same Store Property Portfolio includes properties acquired or placed in service on or prior to July 1, 2023 and owned and consolidated through September 30, 2024, excluding properties classified as held for sale; 
 (b) Total Portfolio, which represents all properties owned and consolidated by us during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023; 
 (c) Recently Completed/Acquired Properties, which represents two properties placed into service or acquired on or subsequent to July 1, 2023; 
 (d) Development/Redevelopment Properties, which represents two properties currently in development/redevelopment. A property is excluded from our Same Store Property Portfolio and moved into Development/Redevelopment Properties in the period that we determine to proceed with development/redevelopment for a future development strategy; and 
 (e) Q3 2023 through Q3 2024 Dispositions, which represents five properties disposed of from July 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024.

Rents 
 Rents decreased primarily as a result of the following: 
 1.6 million decrease due to the sales of 8521 Leesburg Pike, Vienna, VA in the fourth quarter of 2023, Three Barton Skyway, Austin, TX in the third quarter of 2023 and 200 North Radnor Chester Road, Radnor, PA in the fourth quarter of 2023 ; 
 0.5 million decrease due to the early termination of a single tenant occupant at a property in Austin, TX; 
 0.7 million increase related to our Recently Completed/Acquired Properties, which are comprised of 2430 Dulles Corner, Herndon, VA and 250 King of Prussia Road, Radnor, PA; and 
 2.3 million decrease due to net changes in leasing activity within the remainder of the portfolio. 
 Other Revenue 
 Other revenue includes 6.5 million of insurance proceeds in connection with the resolution of a legal dispute that was settled during the third quarter of 2024. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and Amortization decreased primarily as a result of the following: 
 2.3 million decrease related to accelerated depreciation on tenant improvements due to the early termination of a single tenant occupant at a property in our Austin, Texas segment in 2023; 
 1.5 million decrease related to the reduction in the cost basis of assets as a result of the provision for impairment recorded on two properties in the Metropolitan Washington, D.C. area within our Other segment and five office properties located in our Pennsylvania Suburbs segment in 2023; and 
 0.4 million decrease related to the sales of three properties in 2023. 
 Provision for Impairment 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we recognized a provision for impairment of 34.1 million on three properties, two of which are located in the Austin, Texas segment and one which is in the Other segment. We also recognized a provision for impairment of 3.9 million on two disposition transactions during the third quarter of 2024. See Note 3 Real Estate Investments , for further information. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense increased primarily due to our issuance of 400 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.875 Guaranteed Notes due 2029 (the 2029 Notes in April 2024, partially offset by the redemption of our 2024 350.0 million 4.10 Guaranteed Notes. Additionally, interest expense increased during the third quarter of 2023 when Moody s downgraded our senior unsecured credit rating from Baa3 to Ba1. As a result of the downgrade, the interest rate on our 7.55 Guaranteed Notes due 2028 (the 2028 Notes increased 25 basis points in September 2023 due to the coupon adjustment provisions within the 2028 Notes. During the first quarter of 2024, S P downgraded our senior unsecured credit rating from BBB- to BB+. As a result of the downgrade, the interest rate on the 2028 Notes increased 25 basis points to 8.05 in March 2024 due to the coupon adjustment provisions within the 2028 Notes. During the second quarter of 2024, Moody's downgraded our senior unsecured credit rating from Ba1 to Ba2. As a result of the downgrade, the interest rate on the 2028 Notes increased 25 basis points to 8.30 in April 2024 due to the coupon adjustment provisions within the 2028 Notes. 
 Equity in Loss of Real Estate Ventures 
 Equity in loss of real estate ventures increased primarily due to the Company's recognition of an impairment charge on the properties in the Commerce Square Venture. Additionally, the Company recognized an other than temporary impairment loss on its investment in the 4040 Wilson Venture which was offset by the income at the Mid-Atlantic Office Venture .

Table of Contents 

 Rents 
 Rents decreased primarily as a result of the following: 
 6.4 million decrease due to the sales of 8521 Leesburg Pike, Vienna, VA in the fourth quarter of 2023, Three Barton Skyway, Austin, TX in the third quarter of 2023 and 200 North Radnor Chester Road, Radnor, PA in the fourth quarter of 2023 ; 
 2.5 million decrease due to the early termination of a single tenant occupant at a property in Austin, TX; 
 6.4 million increase related to our Recently Completed/Acquired Properties, which are comprised of 2430 Dulles Corner, Herndon, VA and 250 King of Prussia Road, Radnor, PA; and 
 3.2 million decrease due to net changes in leasing activity within the remainder of the portfolio. 
 Other Revenue 
 Other revenue includes 6.5 million of insurance proceeds in connection with the resolution of a legal dispute that was settled during the third quarter of 2024. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization expense decreased primarily as a result of the following: 
 
 4.0 million decrease related to accelerated depreciation on tenant improvements due to the early termination of a single tenant occupant at a property in our Austin, Texas segment in 2023; 
 4.4 million decrease related to the reduction in the cost basis of assets as a result of the provision for impairment recorded on two properties in the Metropolitan Washington, D.C. area within our Other segment and five office properties located in our Pennsylvania Suburbs segment in 2023; 
 2.7 million decrease related to the sales of three properties in 2023; and 
 Partially offset by a 3.2 million increase related to two properties which were placed in service in the second half of 2023. 
 Provision for Impairment 
 During the second quarter of 2024, we recognized a provision for impairment of 6.4 million on office properties located in our Austin, Texas segment. During the third quarter of 2024, we recognized a provision for impairment of 34.1 million on three properties, two located in the Austin, Texas segment and one in the Other segment. We also recognized a provision for impairment of 3.9 million on two disposition transactions during the third quarter of 2024. See Note 3 Real Estate Investments, for further information. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense increased primarily due to our issuance of 400 million aggregate principal amount of 2029 Notes in April 2024, partially offset by the redemption of our 2024 350.0 million 4.10 Guaranteed Notes. Additionally, interest expense increased during the third quarter of 2023 when Moody s downgraded our senior unsecured credit rating from Baa3 to Ba1. As a result of the downgrade, the interest rate on our 2028 Notes increased 25 basis points in September 2023 due to the coupon adjustment provisions within the 2028 Notes. During the first quarter of 2024, S P downgraded our senior unsecured credit rating from BBB- to BB+. As a result of the downgrade, the interest rate on the 2028 Notes increased 25 basis points to 8.05 in March 2024 due to the coupon adjustment provisions within the 2028 Notes. During the second quarter of 2024, Moody's downgraded our senior unsecured credit rating from Ba1 to Ba2. As a result of the downgrade, the interest rate on the 2028 Notes increased 25 basis points to 8.30 in April 2024 due to the coupon adjustment provisions within the 2028 Notes. 
 Equity in Loss of Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures 
 Equity in loss of real estate ventures increased primarily due to the Company's recognition of an impairment charge on the properties in the Commerce Square Venture. See Note 4 Investment in Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures , for further information. Additionally, the increased losses from our unconsolidated real estate ventures are due to higher interest rates on the ventures outstanding indebtedness. 
 Net gain on real estate venture transactions 
 On June 28, 2024, we recapitalized our Original MAP Venture, in which we had a negative investment balance of 52.2 million as of March 31, 2024. In connection with the recapitalization, we recognized a one-time, non-cash gain of 53.8 million in connection with the derecognition of the negative investment balance in the Original MAP Venture. See Note 4 Investment in Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures, for further information.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 General 
 Our principal liquidity funding needs for the next twelve months are as follows: 
 normal recurring expenses; 
 capital expenditures, including capital and tenant improvements and leasing costs; 
 debt service and principal repayment obligations; 
 current development and redevelopment costs; 
 commitments to unconsolidated real estate ventures and investment vehicles; 
 distributions to shareholders to maintain our REIT status; 
 possible acquisitions of properties, either directly or indirectly through the acquisition of equity interest therein; and 
 possible common share repurchases. 
 We expect to satisfy these needs using one or more of the following: 
 cash flows from operations; 
 distributions of cash from our unconsolidated real estate ventures; 
 cash and cash equivalent balances; 
 availability under our Unsecured Credit Facility; 
 secured construction loans and long-term unsecured indebtedness; 
 sales of real estate or contributions of interests in real estate to joint ventures; and 
 issuances of Parent Company equity securities and/or units of the Operating Partnership. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Parent Company owned a 99.7 interest in the Operating Partnership. The remaining interest of approximately 0.3 pertains to common limited partnership interests owned by non-affiliated investors who contributed property to the Operating Partnership in exchange for their interests. As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, the Parent Company has full and complete responsibility for the Operating Partnership s day-to-day operations and management. The Parent Company s source of funding for its dividend payments and other obligations is the distributions it receives from the Operating Partnership. 
 As summarized above, we believe that our liquidity needs will be satisfied through available cash balances and cash flows from operations, financing activities and real estate sales. Rental revenue and other income from operations are our principal sources of cash to pay operating expenses, debt service, recurring capital expenditures and the minimum distributions required to maintain our REIT qualification. We seek to increase cash flows from our properties by maintaining quality standards for our properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing tenant turnover and controlling operating expenses. Our revenue also includes third-party fees generated by our property management, leasing, development/redevelopment and construction businesses. We believe that our revenue, together with proceeds from property sales and debt financings, will continue to provide funds for our short-term liquidity needs. However, material changes in our operating or financing activities may adversely affect our net cash flows. With uncertain economic conditions, vacancy rates may increase, rental rates on new and renewed leases may decrease and tenant installation costs, including concessions, may increase in most or all of our markets during the remainder of 2024 and possibly beyond. As a result, our revenues and cash flows could be insufficient to cover operating expenses, including increased tenant installation costs, pay debt service or make distributions to shareholders over the short-term. If this situation were to occur, we expect that we would finance cash deficits through borrowings under our unsecured credit facility and other sources of debt and equity financings. In addition, a material adverse change in cash provided by operations could adversely affect our compliance with financial performance covenants under our unsecured credit facility, including unsecured term loans and unsecured notes. As of September 30, 2024 we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and requirement obligations. 
 On April 12, 2024, we completed an underwritten offering of 400.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Notes. The 2029 Notes were priced at approximately 99.51 of their face amount. We received approximately 391.8 million of net proceeds after the deduction for underwriting discounts and offering expenses. 
 On April 15, 2024, we commenced a tender offer (the Tender Offer for any and all of the outstanding 335.1 million principal amount of our 4.10 Guaranteed Notes due 2024 (the 2024 Notes ). The purchase price offered per 1,000 principal amount of 2024 Notes pursuant to the Tender Offer was determined by reference to the fixed spread for the 2024 Notes of 0 basis points plus the yield based on the bid-side price of the 4.250 U.S. Treasury due September 30, 2024. The Tender Offer expired on April 19, 2024. Upon completion of the Tender Offer, on April 23, 2024, we issued a redemption notice to redeem any 2024 Notes that remained outstanding after the Tender Offer. On June 7, 2024, we redeemed the remaining 113.4 million of our 2024 Bonds at the aggregate principal amount outstanding together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date.

 The 2028 Notes include an interest rate adjustment provision whereby the interest rate payable on the 2028 Notes is subject to a 25 basis point adjustment if either Moody's Investors Services Inc, and its successors ("Moody's"), or S P Global Ratings, and its successors ("S P") downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) its rating assigned to the 2028 Notes. During the third quarter of 2023, Moody s downgraded our senior unsecured credit rating from Baa3 to Ba1. As a result of the downgrade, the interest rate on the 2028 Notes increased 25 basis points to 7.80 in September 2023. In January 2024, S P downgraded our senior unsecured credit rating from BBB- to BB+. As a result of the downgrade, the interest rate on the 2028 Notes increased 25 basis points to 8.05 in March 2024. During the second quarter of 2024, Moody's downgraded our senior unsecured credit rating from Ba1 to Ba2. As a result of the downgrade, the interest rate on the 2028 Notes increased 25 basis points to 8.30 in April 2024 due to the coupon adjustment provisions within the 2028 Notes. 
 Our ability to incur additional debt is dependent upon a number of factors, including our credit ratings, the value of our unencumbered assets, our degree of leverage and borrowing restrictions imposed by our lenders. If one or more rating agencies were to downgrade our unsecured credit rating, our access to the unsecured debt market would be more limited and the interest rate under our unsecured credit facility and unsecured term loan would increase. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our senior unsecured credit ratings and outlook were as follows: 
 Moody's 
 S P 
 Long-term debt 
 Ba2 
 BB+ 
 Outlook 
 Stable 
 Stable 
 
 If our credit ratings are lowered further, our ability to access the public debt markets, our costs of funds, and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted. Each of the credit ratings agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit ratings will remain the same. 
 The Parent Company unconditionally guarantees the Operating Partnership s unsecured debt obligations, which, as of September 30, 2024, amounted to 2,001.6 million. The Operating Partnership s secured debt obligations as of September 30, 2024, amounted to 274.8 million 
 Capital Markets 
 The Parent Company issues equity from time to time, the proceeds of which it contributes to the Operating Partnership in exchange for additional interests in the Operating Partnership, and guarantees debt obligations of the Operating Partnership. The Parent Company s ability to sell common shares and preferred shares is dependent on, among other things, general market conditions for REITs, market perceptions about the Company as a whole and the current trading price of the Parent Company s shares. The Parent Company maintains a shelf registration statement that covers the offering and sale of common shares, preferred shares, depositary shares, warrants and unsecured debt securities. Subject to our ongoing compliance with securities laws, and if warranted by market conditions, we may offer and sell equity and debt securities from time to time under the shelf registration statement or in transactions exempt from registration. 
 See Note 11 Beneficiaries' Equity of the Parent Company, to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to our share repurchase program. We expect to fund any additional share repurchases with a combination of available cash balances and availability under our unsecured credit facility. The timing and amounts of any repurchases will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions, regulatory requirements, share prices, capital availability and other factors as determined by our management team. The repurchase program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. 
 Liquidity 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 36.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and 520.8 million of available borrowings under our unsecured credit facility, net of 39.2 million in letters of credit outstanding. Based on the foregoing, as well as cash flows from operations net of dividend requirements, we believe we have sufficient capital to fund our remaining capital requirements on existing development and redevelopment projects and pursue additional attractive investment opportunities. We expect that our primary uses of capital during the remainder of 2024 will be to fund our current development and redevelopment projects. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following discussion of our cash flows is based on the consolidated statement of cash flows and is not meant to be a comprehensive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented.

Table of Contents 

 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we maintained cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of 42.7 million and 67.5 million, respectively. We report and analyze our cash flows based on operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. The following table summarizes changes in our cash flows (in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Activity 2024 2023 (Decrease) Increase Operating 124,202 111,405 12,797 Investing (193,031) (139,451) (53,580) Financing 43,988 68,276 (24,288) Net cash flows (24,841) 40,230 (65,071) 
 Our principal source of cash flows is from the leasing of space at of our Properties. Our Properties provide a relatively consistent stream of cash flows that provides us with the resources to fund operating expenses, debt service and quarterly dividends. 
 Cash is used in investing activities to fund acquisitions, development, or redevelopment projects and recurring and nonrecurring capital expenditures. We selectively invest in new projects that we expect will enable us to take advantage of our development/redevelopment, leasing, financing, and property management skills and invest in existing buildings that meet our investment criteria for additional capital. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the change in investing cash flows was due to the following activities (in thousands): 
 (Decrease) Increase Capital expenditures and capitalized interest 13,419 Capital improvements/acquisition deposits/leasing costs 8,831 Unconsolidated real estate venture investments 
 (71,036) Proceeds from the sale of properties (6,035) Capital distributions from unconsolidated real estate ventures 1,241 Increase in net cash used in investing activities (53,580) 
 We generally fund our investment activity through the sale of real estate, property-level financing, unsecured and secured credit facilities, senior unsecured notes, and construction loans. From time to time, we may issue common or preferred shares of beneficial interest, or the Operating Partnership may issue common or preferred units of limited partnership interest. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the change in financing cash flows was due to the following activities (in thousands): 
 (Decrease) Increase Proceeds from debt obligations 72,943 Repayments of debt obligations (115,258) Dividends and distributions paid 20,066 Debt financing costs paid (1,963) Other financing activities (76) Decrease in net cash provided by financing activities (24,288)

 Unsecured Debt 
 The Operating Partnership is the issuer of our unsecured notes which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company. The indenture under which the Operating Partnership issued its unsecured notes contains financial covenants, including: (i) a leverage ratio not to exceed 60 ; (ii) a secured debt leverage ratio not to exceed 40 ; (iii) a debt service coverage ratio of greater than 1.5 to 1.0; and (iv) an unencumbered asset value of not less than 150 of unsecured debt. The Operating Partnership is in compliance with all covenants as of September 30, 2024. 
 The charter documents of the Parent Company and Operating Partnership do not limit the amount or form of indebtedness that the Operating Partnership may incur, and its policies on debt incurrence are solely within the discretion of the Parent

 Company s Board of Trustees, subject to the financial covenants in the credit agreement for our Unsecured Credit Facility, the indenture for our unsecured notes and in our other credit agreements. 
 Equity 
 In order to maintain its qualification as a REIT, the Parent Company is required to, among other things, pay dividends to its shareholders of at least 90 of its REIT taxable income. See Note 11 Beneficiaries' Equity of the Parent Company, to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to our dividends declared for the third quarter of 2024. 
 Inflation and Lease Pass-Through Provisions 
 Substantially all our leases are structured as base year or triple net leases which provide for reimbursement billings for operating expense pass-through charges, real estate tax and insurance reimbursements on a per square-foot basis, or in some cases, annual reimbursement of operating expenses above certain per square-foot allowances. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, approximately 96 of our leases (as a percentage of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our wholly-owned portfolio) contain annual rent escalations that are either fixed (generally ranging from 2.5 to 3.0 per lease year) or indexed based on a consumer price index or other indices. We believe such lease provisions mitigate adverse impacts of inflation on our earnings from real estate operations. However, recent inflation and higher interest rates have caused an increase in our borrowing costs, including on our variable rate debt, and on our operating expenses that are not subject to the lease pass-through provisions. 
 While we have experienced increased inflation, our Same Store Property Portfolio operating margins improved to 63.4 and 63.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily due to the expense reimbursement provisions noted above. The expense reimbursement provisions in our leases resulted in Same Store Property Portfolio operating expense recovery rates of 53.6 and 54.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Other Contractual Obligations 
 We provide customary guarantees for certain development projects of our unconsolidated real estate ventures. See Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies, to our Consolidated Financial Statement for further details on payment guarantees provided on behalf of our real estate ventures and refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a discussion of our contractual obligations. 
 Funds from Operations (FFO) 
 Pursuant to the revised definition of FFO adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT ), we calculate FFO by adjusting net income/(loss) attributable to common unit holders (computed in accordance with GAAP) for gains (or losses) from sales of properties, impairment losses on depreciable consolidated real estate, impairment losses on investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures driven by a measurable decrease in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the unconsolidated real estate ventures, real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after similar adjustments for unconsolidated real estate ventures. Our calculation of FFO includes gains from sale of undepreciated real estate and other assets, considered incidental to our main business, to third parties or unconsolidated real estate ventures. FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe that the use of FFO combined with the required GAAP presentations, has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and making comparisons of REITs operating results more meaningful. We consider FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding property impairments, gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization, FFO can help the investing public compare the operating performance of a company s real estate between periods or as compared to other companies. Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. 
 We consider net income, as defined by GAAP, to be the most comparable earnings measure to FFO. While FFO and FFO per unit are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of REITs, FFO does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO should be compared with our reported net income/(loss) attributable to common unit holders and considered in addition to cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements.

 The following table presents a reconciliation of net income attributable to common shares and common unitholders to FFO for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates, commodity prices and equity prices. In pursuing our business plan, the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk. Changes in the general level of interest rates prevailing in the financial markets may affect the spread between our yield on invested assets and cost of funds and, in turn, our ability to make distributions or payments to our shareholders. While we have not experienced any significant credit losses, in the event of a significant rising interest rate environment and/or continued economic slowdown, defaults could increase and result in losses to us which would adversely affect our operating results and liquidity. 
 Interest Rate Risk and Sensitivity Analysis 
 The analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of the Operating Partnership s financial instruments to selected changes in market rates. The range of changes chosen reflects its view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one-year period. Market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates chosen. 
 Our financial instruments consist of both fixed and variable rate debt. As of September 30, 2024, our consolidated debt consisted of (i) unsecured notes with an outstanding principal balance of 1,563.0 million, all of which are fixed rate borrowings, (ii) variable rate debt consisting of trust preferred securities that have been swapped to fixed rates with an outstanding principal balance of 78.6 million, (iii) a 600.0 million revolving credit facility with an outstanding principal balance of 40.0 million , (iv) a secured fixed rate term loan with an outstanding principal balance of 245.0 million and (v) two unsecured term loans of 250.0 million and 70.0 million. The 250.0 million unsecured term loan has been swapped to a fixed rate. All financial instruments were entered into for other than trading purposes and the net market value of these financial instruments is referred to as the net financial position. Changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variable rate portions of our debt portfolio. A change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position, but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows. A change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows, but does not impact the net financial instrument position. 
 If market rates of interest increase by 100 basis points, the fair value of our outstanding secured fixed rate debt would increase by approximately 7.2 million. If market rates of interest decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of our outstanding secured fixed rate debt would decrease by approximately 7.4 million.

Table of Contents 

 As of September 30, 2024, based on prevailing interest rates and credit spreads, the fair value of our unsecured notes was 1,586.0 million. For sensitivity purposes, a 100-basis point change in the discount rate equates to a change in the total fair value of our debt of approximately 15.9 million at September 30, 2024. 
 From time to time or as the need arises, we use derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk exposures and not for speculative or trading purposes. The total outstanding principal balance of our variable rate debt was approximately 468.4 million as of September 30, 2024. The total fair value of our variable rate debt was approximately 433.9 million at September 30, 2024. For sensitivity purposes, if market rates of interest increase by 100 basis points the fair value of our variable rate debt would decrease by approximately 12.0 million at September 30, 2024. If market rates of interest decrease by 100 basis points the fair value of our outstanding variable rate debt would increase by approximately 12.7 million at September 30, 2024. 
 These amounts were determined solely by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments. Due to the uncertainty of specific actions we may undertake to minimize possible effects of market interest rate increases, this analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure.
