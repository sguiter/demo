of TJX s estimated notional diesel fuel requirements for the remainder of fiscal 2025 and the first nine months of fiscal 2026. These diesel fuel hedge agreements will settle throughout fiscal 2025 and throughout the first ten months of fiscal 2026. Upon settlement, the realized gains and losses on these contracts are offset by the realized gains and losses of the underlying item in Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs. TJX elected not to apply hedge accounting to these contracts. 
 Foreign Currency Contracts 
 TJX enters into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to obtain economic hedges on portions of merchandise purchases made and anticipated to be made by the Company s operations in currencies other than their respective functional currencies. The contracts outstanding at November 2, 2024 cover merchandise purchases the Company is committed to over the next several months in fiscal 2025. Additionally, TJX s operations in Europe are subject to foreign currency exposure as a result of their buying function being centralized in the U.K. Merchandise is purchased centrally in the U.K. and then shipped and billed to the retail entities in other countries. This intercompany billing to TJX s European businesses Euro denominated operations creates exposure to the central buying entity for changes in the exchange rate between the Euro and British Pound. A portion of the inflows of Euros to the central buying entity provides a natural hedge for Euro denominated merchandise purchases from third-party vendors. TJX calculates any excess Euro exposure each month and enters into forward contracts of approximately days' duration to mitigate this excess exposure. Upon settlement, the realized gains and losses on these contracts are offset by the realized gains and losses of the underlying item in Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs. 
 TJX also enters into derivative contracts, generally designated as fair value hedges, to hedge intercompany debt. The changes in fair value of these contracts are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses and are offset by marking the underlying item to fair value in the same period. Upon settlement, the realized gains and losses on these contracts are offset by the realized gains and losses of the underlying item in Selling, general and administrative expenses.

 Level 2 Assets: Foreign currency exchange contracts Diesel fuel contracts Liabilities: Foreign currency exchange contracts Diesel fuel contracts 
 Investments designed to meet obligations under the Executive Savings Plan are invested in registered investment companies traded in active markets and are recorded at unadjusted quoted prices. 
 Foreign currency exchange contracts and diesel fuel contracts are valued using broker quotations, which include observable market information. TJX does not make adjustments to quotes or prices obtained from brokers or pricing services but does assess the credit risk of counterparties and will adjust final valuations when appropriate. Where independent pricing services provide fair values, TJX obtains an understanding of the methods used in pricing. As such, these instruments are classified within Level 2. 
 The fair value of TJX s general corporate debt was estimated by obtaining market quotes given the trading levels of other bonds of the same general issuer type and market perceived credit quality. These inputs are considered to be Level 2 inputs. These estimates do not necessarily reflect provisions or restrictions in the various debt agreements that might affect TJX s ability to settle these obligations. 
 
 For additional information on long-term debt, see Note I Long-Term Debt and Credit Lines. 
 TJX s cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments. 
 Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, whereas the majority of assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as when there is evidence of an impairment. For the periods ended November 2, 2024, February 3, 2024 and October 28, 2023, the Company did not record any material impairments to long-lived assets.

 All of TJX s stores, with the exception of HomeGoods and HomeSense/Homesense, sell family apparel and home fashions. HomeGoods and HomeSense/Homesense offer home fashions. 
 TJX evaluates the performance of its segments based on segment profit or loss, which it defines as pre-tax income or loss before general corporate expense, interest (income) expense, net and certain separately disclosed unusual or infrequent items. Segment profit or loss, as defined by TJX, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. This measure of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of TJX s performance or as a measure of liquidity.

 Credit Facilities 
 The Company has TJX revolving credit facilities, a billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility maturing in June 2026 (the 2026 Revolving Credit Facility and a million revolving credit facility that was set to mature in May 2024 (the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility ). On May 8, 2023, the Company amended the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility (as amended, the 2028 Revolving Credit Facility to (i) extend the maturity to May 8, 2028 and (ii) replace the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR with a term secured overnight financing rate plus a credit spread adjustment Adjusted Term SOFR ). Term SOFR borrowings under the 2028 Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at the Adjusted Term SOFR plus a margin of - basis points and a quarterly facility fee payment of - basis points on the total commitments under the 2028 Revolving Credit Facility, in each case, based on the Company s long-term debt ratings. All other material terms and conditions of the 2028 Revolving Credit Facility were unchanged from the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility. 
 Additionally, on May 8, 2023, the Company amended its 2026 Revolving Credit Facility to replace the LIBOR with Adjusted Term SOFR. Term SOFR borrowings under the 2026 Revolving Credit Facility, as amended, bear interest at the Adjusted Term SOFR plus a variable margin based on the Company s long-term debt ratings. All other material terms and conditions of the 2026 Revolving Credit Facility were unchanged. 
 Under these credit facilities, the Company has maintained a borrowing capacity of billion. A s of November 2, 2024, February 3, 2024 and October 28, 2023, and during the quarters and year then ended, there were amounts outstanding under these facilities. Each of these facilities require TJX to maintain a ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and rentals (EBITDAR) of not more than to 1.00 on a rolling four-quarter basis. TJX was in compliance with all covenants related to its credit facilities at the end of all periods presented. 
 In addition, as of November 2, 2024, February 3, 2024 and October 28, 2023, TJX Canada had credit lines, a C million facility for operating expenses and a C million letter of credit facility. As of November 2, 2024, February 3, 2024 and October 28, 2023, and during the quarters and year then ended, there were amounts outstanding on the Canadian credit line for operating expenses. As of November 2, 2024, February 3, 2024 and October 28, 2023, the Company s European business at TJX International had a credit line of million.

Note J. 
 for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 and for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase in the effective income tax rate in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 was primarily due to the decrease in excess tax benefit from share-based compensation, partially offset by the resolution of various tax matters. 
 TJX had net unrecognized tax benefits of million as of November 2, 2024, million as of February 3, 2024 and million as of October 28, 2023. 
 TJX is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax in multiple state, local and foreign jurisdictions. In the U.S. and India, fiscal years through 2010 are no longer subject to examination. In all other jurisdictions, fiscal years through 2011 are no longer subject to examination. 
 TJX s accounting policy is to classify interest and penalties related to income tax matters as part of income tax expense. The accrued amounts for interest and penalties on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were million as of November 2, 2024, million as of February 3, 2024 and million as of October 28, 2023. 
 Based on the final resolution of tax examinations, judicial or administrative proceedings, changes in facts or law, expirations of statutes of limitations in specific jurisdictions or other resolutions of, or changes in, tax positions, it is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax benefits for certain tax positions taken on previously filed tax returns may change materially from those represented on the Consolidated Financial Statements as of November 2, 2024. During the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions may reduce unrecognized tax benefits by up to million, which would reduce the provision for taxes on earnings.

 The Thirteen Weeks (third quarter) and Thirty-Nine Weeks (nine months) Ended October 28, 2023 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 We are the leading off-price apparel and home fashions retailer in the U.S. and worldwide. Our mission is to deliver great value to our customers every day. We do this by selling a rapidly changing assortment of apparel, home fashions and other merchandise at prices generally 20 to 60 below full-price retailers (including department, specialty and major online retailers) regular prices on comparable merchandise, every day through our stores and six e-commerce sites . We opera te over 5,000 stores through our four main segments: in the U.S., Marmaxx (which operates TJ Maxx, Marshalls, tjmaxx.com and marshalls.com) and HomeGoods (which operates HomeGoods and Homesense); TJX Canada (which operates Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls in Canada); and TJX International (which operates TK Maxx, Homesense, tkmaxx.com, tkmaxx.de, and tkmaxx.at in Europe, and TK Maxx in Australia). In addition to our four main segments, Sierra operates retail stores and sierra.com in the U.S. The results of Sierra are included in the Marmaxx segment. 
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 As an overview of our financial performance, results for the quarter ended November 2, 2024 include the following: 
 Net sales increased 6 to 14.1 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 versus last year s third quarter sales of 13.3 billion. As of November 2, 2024, both the number of stores in operation and the selling square footage increased 2 compared to the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 Consolidated comp store sales increased 3 for the third quarter of fiscal 2025. See Net Sales below for our definition of comp store sales. 
 Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 were 1.14 versus 1.03 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 Pre-tax profit margin (the ratio of pre-tax income to net sales) for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 was 12.3 , a 0.3 percentage point increase compared with 12.0 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 Our cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, ratio for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 was 68.4 , a 0.5 percentage point decrease compared with 68.9 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 Our selling, general and administrative SG A expense ratio for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 was 19.5 , a 0.1 percentage point increase compared with 19.4 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 Our consolidated average per store inventories, including inventory on hand at our distribution centers (which excludes inventory in transit) and excluding our e-commerce sites and Sierra stores, were down 2 at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 During the third quarter of fiscal 2025, we returned 997 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
 We announced that we plan to enter Spain with our TK Maxx banner in fiscal 2027. 
 
 Equity Investments 
 On June 7, 2024, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement for a joint venture with Grupo Axo, S.A.P.I de C.V. Axo to hold a 49 ownership stake in Multibrand Outlet Stores S.A.P.I. de C.V. MOS ), Axo s off-price, physical store business in Mexico. We have the option to increase our ownership interest in the joint venture over the long term. On September 3, 2024, we completed this investment for 192 million, which includes a purchase price of 179 million and acquisition costs of 13 million. This investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. 
 On August 21, 2024, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire a 35 ownership stake in privately held Brands for Less BFL ), representing a non-controlling, minority position. BFL currently operates over 100 stores, primarily in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, as well as an e-commerce business, and is the region s only major off-price branded apparel, toys and home fashions retailer. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, we completed this investment for a purchase price of 344 million. This investment will be accounted for under the equity method of accounting from the date of investment forward. 
 22 

We will report the results of our share of the investments with Axo and BFL on a one-quarter lag as their results are not expected to be available in time to be recorded in the concurrent period. We do not expect these investments to have a material impact on our fiscal 2025 results. 
 
 Recent Events and Trends 
 Global Economic Conditions and Industry Trends 
 We continue to closely monitor changes in international trade relations, economic and monetary policies, or legislation and regulations including those related to tariffs on imports from China and other countries, which could adversely impact the global economy and our operating results. In particular, the potential impact on our direct imports, vendor and competitor pricing, consumer demand and tariff pass-throughs remains uncertain. 
 
 Operating Results as a Percentage of Net Sales 
 The following table sets forth our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales: Thirteen Weeks Ended Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended November 2, 2024 October 28, 2023 November 2, 2024 October 28, 2023 Net sales 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs 68.4 68.9 69.3 69.9 Selling, general and administrative expenses 19.5 19.4 19.5 19.5 Interest (income) expense, net (0.3) (0.3) (0.3) (0.3) Income before income taxes

 Figures may not foot due to rounding. 
 
 Net Sales 
 Net sales for the quarter ended November 2, 2024 totaled 14.1 billion, a 6 increase versus third quarter fiscal 2024 net sales of 13.3 billion. This increase reflects a 3 increase in comp store sales, a 2 increase from non-comp store sales and a 1 positive foreign currency exchange rate impact. Net sales from our e-commerce sites combined amounted to less than 2 of total sales for each of the third quarters of fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024. 
 Net sales for the nine months ended November 2, 2024 totaled 40.0 billion, a 6 increase versus net sales of 37.8 billion for the first nine months fiscal 2024. This increase reflects a 3 increase in comp store sales, a 3 increase from non-comp store sales and a neutral foreign currency exchange rate impact. Net sales from our e-commerce sites combined amounted to less than 2 of total sales for each of the first nine months of fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024. 
 Comp store sales increased 3 for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 and increased 6 for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Comp store sales increased 3 for the first nine months of fiscal 2025 and increased 5 for the first nine months of fiscal 2024. While both home comp store sales growth (as defined below) and apparel comp store sales growth (as defined below) were positive, home comp store sales growth outperformed apparel comp store sales growth for both the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2025. Comp store sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 were driven by an increase in customer transactions, partially offset by a decrease in average basket. Comp store sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2025 were driven by an increase in customer transactions. 
 As of November 2, 2024, both our store count and selling square footage increased 2 compared to the end of the third quarter last year. 
 Definition of Comparable Store Sales 
 We define comparable store sales, or comp store sales, to be sales of stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years, or, in other words, stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation. We calculate comp store sales on a 52-week basis by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned. Relocated stores and stores that have changed in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store, and we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated comp store sales percentage is immaterial. 
 Sales excluded from comp store sales non-comp store sales consist of sales from: 
 New stores - stores that have not yet met the comp store sales criteria, which represents a substantial majority of non-comp store sales 
 Stores that are closed permanently or for an extended period of time 
 Sales from our e-commerce sites 
 23 

We determine which stores are included in the comp store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year, and the classification remains constant throughout that year unless a store is closed permanently or for an extended period during that fiscal year. 
 Comp store sales of our foreign segments are calculated on a constant currency basis. We define constant currency basis as translating the current year s results using the prior year s exchange rates. This removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, which we believe is a more appropriate measure of performance. 
 Comp store sales may be referred to as same store sales by other retail companies. The method for calculating comp store sales varies across the retail industry; therefore, our measure of comp store sales may not be comparable to that of other retail companies. Comparable store sales for a category such as home or apparel include sales from merchandise within such category combined across all divisions at the stores that fall within the Company s definition of comparable stores for such period. 
 Historically, we defined customer traffic to be the number of transactions in stores included in the comp store sales calculation; since the end of fiscal 2024, we refer to this as customer transactions. We define average ticket to be the average retail price of the units sold. We define average basket to be the average dollar value of transactions. 
 Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rates 
 Our operating results are affected by foreign currency exchange rates as a result of changes in the value of the U.S. dollar or a division s local currency in relation to other currencies. We specifically refer to foreign currency as the impact of translational foreign currency exchange and mark-to-market of inventory derivatives, as described in detail below. This does not include the impact foreign currency exchange rates can have on various transactions that are denominated in a currency other than an operating division's local currency, which is referred to as transactional foreign exchange, and also described below. 
 Translation Foreign Exchange 
 In our Consolidated Financial Statements, we translate the operations of TJX Canada and TJX International from local currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time. Significant changes in foreign exchange rates between comparable prior periods can result in meaningful variations in assets, liabilities, net sales, net income and earnings per share as well as the net sales and operating results of these segments. Currency translation generally does not affect operating margins, or affects them only slightly, as sales and expenses of the foreign operations are translated at approximately the same rates within a given period. 
 Mark-to-Market Inventory Derivatives 
 We routinely enter into inventory-related hedging instruments to mitigate the impact on earnings of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise purchases denominated in currencies other than the local currencies of our divisions, principally TJX Canada and TJX International. As we have not elected hedge accounting for these instruments, as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ), we record a mark-to-market gain or loss on the derivative instruments in our results of operations at the end of each reporting period. In subsequent periods, the income statement impact of the mark-to-market adjustment is effectively offset when the inventory being hedged is paid for. While these effects occur every reporting period, they are of much greater magnitude when there are sudden and significant changes in currency exchange rates during a short period of time. The mark-to-market adjustment on these derivatives does not affect net sales, but it does affect the cost of sales, operating margins and earnings we report. 
 Transactional Foreign Exchange 
 When discussing the impact on our results of the effect of foreign currency exchange rates on certain transactions, we refer to it as transactional foreign exchange . This primarily includes the impact that foreign currency exchange rates may have on the year-over-year comparison of merchandise margin as well as foreign currency gains and losses on transactions that are denominated in a currency other than the operating division's local currency. These two items can impact segment margin comparison of our foreign divisions and we have highlighted them when they are meaningful to understanding operating trends. 
 
 Cost of Sales, Including Buying and Occupancy Costs 
 Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales was 68.4 for the third quarter of fiscal 2025, a decrease of 0.5 percentage points compared to 68.9 for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease in the cost of sales ratio, including buying and occupancy costs, for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 was attributable to higher merchandise margin due to higher markon, partially offset by the unfavorable year-over-year impacts related to the mark-to-market adjustment on inventory hedges. 
 24 

Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales was 69.3 for the first nine months of fiscal 2025, a decrease of 0.6 percentage points compared to 69.9 for the first nine months of fiscal 2024. The decrease in the cost of sales ratio, including buying and occupancy costs, for the first nine months of fiscal 2025 was attributable to higher merchandise margin due to higher markon and lower freight costs, partially offset by higher supply chain costs. 
 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 SG A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, was 19.5 for the third quarter of fiscal 2025, an increase of 0.1 percentage points compared to 19.4 for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase in the SG A ratio for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 was due to incremental store wage and payroll costs, partially offset by the year-over-year benefit from closing HomeGoods e-commerce business last year. 
 SG A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, was 19.5 for the first nine months of fiscal 2025, flat compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2024. The SG A ratio was flat for the first nine months of fiscal 2025 due to a favorable year-over-year impact from a prior year reserve related to a German COVID program receivable and the year-over-year benefit from closing HomeGoods e-commerce business last year, offset by incremental store wage and payroll costs. 
 
 Interest (Income) Expense, net 
 The components of interest (income) expense, net are summarized below: Thirteen Weeks Ended Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended In millions November 2, 2024 October 28, 2023 November 2, 2024 October 28, 2023 Interest expense 20 20 59 63 Capitalized interest (1) (0) (3) Interest (income) (63) (60) (198) (176) Interest (income) expense, net (43) (41) (139) (116) 
 Interest (income) expense, net increased for both the third quarter of fiscal 2025 and first nine months ended November 2, 2024 compared to the same periods in fiscal 2024 due to an increase in interest income driven by higher average cash balances. 
 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 In 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development announced an Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting including Pillar Two Model Rules defining the global minimum tax, which calls for the taxation of large multinational corporations at a minimum rate of 15 . Subsequently, multiple sets of administrative guidance have been issued. Many non-US tax jurisdictions have either recently enacted legislation to adopt certain components of the Pillar Two Model Rules beginning in 2024 with the adoption of additional components in later years or announced their plans to enact legislation in future years. These rules did not have a material impact on our financial statements for the third quarter or the first nine months of fiscal 2025 and are not expected to materially increase our global tax costs on our fiscal 2025 financial statements. There remains uncertainty as to the final Pillar Two model rules. We are continuing to evaluate the impacts of enacted legislation and pending legislation to enact Pillar Two Model Rules in the non-US tax jurisdictions we operate in. 
 The e ffective income tax rate was 25.3 for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 and 25.0 for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The e ffective income tax rate was 24.6 for the first nine months of fiscal 2025 and 25.5 for the first nine months of fiscal 2024. This increase in the effective income tax rate for the third quarter and the decrease in the effective income tax rate for the first nine months of fiscal 2025 were primarily due to the impact of excess tax benefit from share-based compensation and the resolution of various tax matters. 
 
 Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share 
 Net income was 1.3 billion, or 1.14 per diluted share, and 1.2 billion, or 1.03 per diluted share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, respectively. Foreign currency had a 0.01 positive impact on diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 and a 0.02 positive impact on diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 Net income was 3.5 billion, or 3.03 per diluted share, and 3.1 billion, or 2.65 per diluted share, for the first nine months of fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, respectively. Foreign currency had a 0.01 positive impact on diluted earnings per share for the first nine months of fiscal 2025 and the first nine month of fiscal 2024.

Segment Information 
 We operate four main business segments. In the United States, our Marmaxx segment operates TJ Maxx, Marshalls, tjmaxx.com and marshalls.com and our HomeGoods segment operates HomeGoods and Homesense. Our TJX Canada segment operates Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls in Canada, and our TJX International segment operates TK Maxx, Homesense, tkmaxx.com , tkmaxx.de, and tkmaxx.at in Europe and TK Maxx in Australia. In addition to our four main segments, Sierra operates retail stores and sierra.com in the U.S. The results of Sierra are included in the Marmaxx segment. 
 We evaluate the performance of our segments based on segment profit or loss, which we define as pre-tax income or loss before general corporate expense and interest (income) expense, net, and certain separately disclosed unusual or infrequent items. Segment profit or loss, as we define the term, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The terms segment margin or segment profit margin are used to describe segment profit or loss as a percentage of net sales. These measures of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities, as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity. 
 Presented below is selected financial information related to our business segments.

 ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our liquidity requirements have traditionally been funded through cash generated from operations, supplemented, as needed, by short-term bank borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper. As of November 2, 2024, there were no short-term bank borrowings or commercial paper outstanding. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, internally generated funds and our credit facilities, under which facilities we have 1.5 billion available as of the period ended November 2, 2024, as described in Note I Long-Term Debt and Credit Lines of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, are adequate to meet our operating needs for the foreseeable future. 
 As of November 2, 2024, we held 4.7 billion in cash. Approximately 1.7 billion of our cash was held by our foreign subsidiaries with 956 million held in countries where we intend to indefinitely reinvest any undistributed earnings. We have provided for all applicable state and foreign withholding taxes on all undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries in Canada, Puerto Rico, Italy, India, Hong Kong and Vietnam through November 2, 2024. If we repatriate cash from such subsidiaries, we should not incur additional tax expense and our cash would be reduced by the amount of withholding taxes paid. 
 We monitor debt financing markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may incur additional long-term indebtedness depending on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, existing economic conditions and other factors. Periodically, we have used, and in the future we may again use, operating cash flow and cash on hand to repay portions of our indebtedness, depending on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, existing economic conditions, contractual restrictions and other factors. As such, we may, from time to time, seek to retire, redeem, prepay or purchase our outstanding debt through redemptions, cash purchases, prepayments, refinancings and/or exchanges, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. If we use our operating cash flow and/or cash on hand to repay our debt, it will reduce the amount of cash available for additional capital expenditures. 
 
 Operating Activities 
 Operating activities resulted in net cash inflows of 3.4 billion for the nine months ended November 2, 2024 and net cash inflows of 3.3 billion for the nine months ended October 28, 2023. 
 Operating cash flows increased 155 million compared to fiscal 2024 primarily due to a 395 million increase in net income, partially offset by a 246 million decrease in accrued expenses primarily due to incentive compensation costs. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 Investing activities resulted in net cash outflows of 1.6 billion for the nine months ended November 2, 2024 and 1.3 billion for the nine months ended October 28, 2023. The cash outflows for both periods were driven by capital expenditures. In addition, the first nine months of fiscal 2025 includes the purchase of an equity method investment. 
 Capital expenditures in the first nine months of fiscal 2025 primarily reflected store improvements and renovations, investments in our new stores, as well as investments in our distribution centers and offices, including information technology. We anticipate that capital spending for the full fiscal year 2025 will be approximately 2.0 billion to 2.1 billion .

On June 7, 2024, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement for a joint venture with Axo to hold a 49 ownership stake in MOS, Axo s off-price, physical store business in Mexico. We and Axo both expect to make additional future investments in the joint venture to support the expected growth of the business. We have the option to increase our ownership interest in the joint venture over the long term. On September 3, 2024, we completed this investment for 192 million, which includes a purchase price of 179 million and acquisition costs of 13 million. 
 On August 21, 2024, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to make an investment for a 35 ownership stake in privately held BFL, representing a non-controlling, minority position. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, we completed this investment for a purchase price of 344 million. 
 We funded these expenditures and investments with our existing cash balances and through internally generated funds. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 Financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of 2.7 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2025 and net cash outflows of 3.1 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2024. The cash outflows for both periods were primarily driven by equity repurchases and dividend payments. 
 Debt 
 The cash outflows in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 were due to the repayment of our 500 million 2.500 ten-year Notes due May 2023 during the second quarter of fiscal 2024. For further information regarding long-term debt, see Note I Long-Term Debt and Credit Lines of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Equity 
 Under our stock repurchase programs, we paid 1.7 billion to repurchase and retire 15.4 million shares of our stock in the first nine months of fiscal 2025. During the second quarter of fiscal 2025, we completed stock repurchases representing all of the 1 billion that remained as of February 3, 2024 from the previously announced stock repurchase program. As of November 2, 2024, approximately 1.9 billion remained available under our existing stock repurchase program. We paid 1.7 billion to repurchase and retire 20.3 million shares of our stock in the first nine months of fiscal 2024. We currently plan to repurchase approximately 2.25 billion to 2.5 billion of stock under our stock repurchase programs in fiscal 2025. For further information regarding equity repurchases, see Note D Capital Stock and Earnings Per Share of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Dividends 
 We declared quarterly dividends on our common stock of 0.375 per share for each of the quarters in the first nine months of fiscal 2025 and 0.3325 per share for each of the quarters in the first nine months of fiscal 2024. Cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled 1.2 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2025 and 1.1 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2024.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 There have been no material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2024 . 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 We have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of November 2, 2024 pursuant to Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Act ). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of implementing controls and procedures. 
 Effective September 30, 2024, we implemented a new treasury management system to simplify and standardize our global treasury process while aimed at enhancing the control environment surrounding the Company's treasury related activities. Except as described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Act) during the fiscal quarter ended November 2, 2024 identified in connection with the evaluation by our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
