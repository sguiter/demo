Information Concerning Forward-Looking Statements 
 This report contains certain statements related to future results, or states our intentions, beliefs and expectations or predictions for the future of Arthur J. Gallagher Co. and its subsidiaries, collectively referred to herein as we, our, us, Gallagher or the company, which are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward looking statements relate to expectations or forecasts of future events. Such statements use words such as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, contemplate, forecast, project, intend, plan, potential, and other similar terms, and future or conditional tense verbs like could, may, might, see, should, will and would. You can also identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. For example, we may use forward-looking statements when addressing topics such as: the impact of general economic conditions, including inflation, interest rates and market uncertainty; the effects of geopolitical volatility, including repercussions from the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East; market and industry conditions, including competitive and pricing trends and the impact of large natural events; acquisition strategy including the expected size of our acquisition program; the expected impact of acquisitions and dispositions and integrating recent acquisitions, including comments regarding the expected benefits of our acquisition of the Willis Towers Watson plc treaty reinsurance brokerage operations (which we refer to as Willis Re), BCHR Holdings, L.P., and its subsidiaries, dba Buck (which we refer to as Buck), Cadence Insurance, Inc. (which we refer to as Cadence Insurance), Eastern Insurance Group, LLC (which we refer to as Eastern Insurance), My Plan Manager Group Pty Ltd (which we refer to as My Plan Manager) and other acquisitions larger than our typical tuck-in acquisitions and the expected duration and costs of integrating such large acquisitions; the development and performance of our services and products; changes in the composition or level of our revenues or earnings; our cost structure and the size and outcome of cost-saving or restructuring initiatives; future capital expenditures; future debt levels and anticipated actions to be taken in connection with maturing debt; future debt to earnings ratios; the outcome of contingencies; dividend policy; pension obligations; cash flow and liquidity; capital structure and financial losses; future actions by regulators; the outcome of existing regulatory actions, audits, reviews or litigation; the impact of changes in accounting rules; financial markets; interest rates; foreign exchange rates; matters relating to our operations; income taxes; expectations regarding our investments; human capital management, including diversity and inclusion initiatives; and environmental, social and governance matters, including climate-resilience and climate-advising products and services and carbon emissions. These forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from either historical or anticipated results depending on a variety of factors. 
 Potential factors that could impact results include: 
 Global economic and geopolitical events, such as fluctuations in interest and inflation rates; a recession or economic downturn; failures of financial institutions and other counterparties; a potential United States (U.S.) government shutdown or gridlock over increasing the U.S. debt ceiling; political violence and instability, including as a result of geo-economic fragmentation or the U.S. elections; 

Economic conditions that result in financial difficulties for underwriting enterprises or lead to reduced risk-taking capital capacity, for example, as a result of large payouts related to extreme weather events, or to the failure of such enterprises, including the increased risk of errors and omissions (which we refer to as E O) claims against us; 

Risks that could negatively affect the success of our acquisition strategy, including the impact of economic uncertainty on our ability to source, review and price acquisitions; continuing consolidation in our industry and interest in acquiring insurance brokers on the part of private equity firms and newly public insurance brokers, which makes it more difficult to identify targets and in some cases makes them more expensive; inaccurate assumptions and failure to realize expected benefits; the risk that we may not receive timely regulatory approval of pending transactions; closing risks; execution risks; integration risks; poor cultural fit; the risk of post-acquisition deterioration leading to intangible asset impairment charges; and the risk we could incur or assume unanticipated liabilities such as cybersecurity issues or those relating to violations of anti-corruption and sanctions laws; 

Risks related to Willis Re, Buck, Cadence Insurance, Eastern Insurance, My Plan Manager and other acquisitions larger than our usual tuck-in acquisitions, including risks related to our ability to successfully integrate operations (including with respect to technology and financial systems required to be converted as transition services agreements phase out from time to time), the possibility that our assumptions may be inaccurate resulting in unforeseen obligations or liabilities and failure to realize the expected benefits of these acquisitions; 

Damage to our reputation, including as a result of environmental, social and governance (which we refer to as ESG) matters, and the potential for the Internet and social media to magnify the effects of such reputational issues; 

Failure to meet our sustainability and ESG-related aspirations, goals and initiatives or to comply with increasingly complex climate-related regulations including increased risks related to greenwashing 

Failure to apply technology, data analytics and artificial intelligence (which we refer to as AI) effectively in driving value for our clients through technology-based solutions, or failure to gain internal efficiencies and effective internal controls through the application of technology and related tools; 

- 2 - 

Risks associated with the use of AI in our business operations, including regulatory, data privacy, cybersecurity, E O and competition risks; 

Failure to attract and retain experienced and qualified talent, including our senior management team, or adequately plan and execute for the succession of such leaders; increased costs resulting from increased compensation and benefits packages as a result of a tighter labor market, and negative effects from restrictions on non-compete agreements at the state level; 

Substantial increase in remote work among our employees, which may affect our corporate culture, productivity, collaboration and effective communication, increase cybersecurity or data breaches risks, heighten vulnerability to solicitations by competing firms and impact our ability to recruit and retain employees that prefer fully remote or fully in person work environments; 

A disaster or other significant disruption to business continuity for our own operations or those of third-parties on which we rely, including cybersecurity incidents; natural disasters; political violence and unrest in the U.S. or elsewhere around the world; for example, our substantial operations in India could be negatively impacted as a result of the dispute between India and Pakistan involving the Kashmir region, rising tensions between India and China, incidents of terrorism in India, civil unrest or other reasons; 

Sustained increases in the cost of employee benefits and compensation expense; 

Risks arising from our international operations and changes in international conditions, including the risks posed by political and economic uncertainty in certain countries (including repercussions from the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East and the results of the U.S. elections), maintaining regulatory and legal compliance across multiple jurisdictions (such as those relating to violations of anti corruption, sanctions, and privacy laws, increasingly complex regulatory requirements related to climate change and sustainability issues and increased protectionism), tariffs, trade wars, climate change and other long-term environmental, social and governance matters and global health risks; 

Risks related to changes in U.S. or foreign tax laws, including a U.S. or foreign tax rate change, potential changes in guidance related to the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development s (OECD) global minimum corporate tax regime, and other local policy changes; 

Competitive pressures, including as a result of innovation, in each of our businesses; 

Volatility or declines in premiums or other adverse trends in the insurance industry; 

The higher level of variability inherent in contingent and supplemental revenues versus standard commission revenues; 

Risks particular to our benefit consulting operations, including risks related to the acquisition of Buck; 

Risks particular to our third-party claims administrations operations, including risks related to the availability of RISX FACS , our proprietary risk management information system, wage inflation, staffing shortages, any slowing of the trend toward outsourcing claims administration, and the concentration of large amounts of revenue with certain clients; 

Climate risks, including the risk of a systemic economic crisis and disruptions to our business caused by the transition to a low-carbon economy; 

Cyber-attacks or other cybersecurity incidents and the heightened risk of such attacks as a result of the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East; improper disclosure of confidential, personal or proprietary data and changes to laws and regulations governing cybersecurity and data privacy; 

Unfavorable determinations related to contingencies and legal proceedings; 

Violations or alleged violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (which we refer to as FCPA), the United Kingdom (U.K.) Bribery Act 2010 or other anti-corruption laws and the Foreign Account Tax Compliance provisions of the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act, and the outcome of any existing or future investigation, review, regulatory action or litigation; 

Failure to comply with regulatory requirements, including those related to governance and control requirements in particular jurisdictions, international sanctions, including new sanctions laws as a result of the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East; laws relating to the disclosure of ESG-related matters; laws relating to the use of AI, or a change in regulations or enforcement policies that adversely affects our operations (for example, relating to insurance broker compensation methods or restrictions on non-compete agreements); 

Changes to our financial presentation from new accounting estimates and assumptions; 

- 3 - 

Intellectual property risks; 

Risks related to our legacy clean energy investments, including intellectual property claims, environmental and product liability claims, environmental compliance costs and the risk of disallowance by the Internal Revenue Service of previously claimed tax credits; 

The risk that our outstanding debt adversely affects our financial flexibility and restrictions and limitations in the agreements and instruments governing our debt; 

The risk of credit rating downgrades; 

The risk that we may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions from our subsidiaries, including the effects of significant changes in foreign exchange rates; 

The risk of share ownership dilution when we issue common stock; and 

Volatility of the price of our common stock. 

Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. They involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including the risk factors referred to above. Our future performance and actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of, and are based on information available to us on the date of the applicable document. Many of the factors that will determine these results are beyond our ability to control or predict. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any such statements or release publicly any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect new information, future or unexpected events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law or regulation. In addition, historical, current and forward-looking sustainability-related or ESG-related statements may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future. 
 A detailed discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our published expectations is contained under the heading Risk Factors in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and any other reports we file with the SEC in the future.

Notes to September 30, 2024 Consolidate d Financial Statements (Unaudited) 
 reportable segments: brokerage, risk management and corporate. Our brokers, agents and administrators act as intermediaries between underwriting enterprises and our clients. Our brokerage segment operations provide brokerage and consulting services to entities of all types, including commercial, nonprofit, public sector entities, and, to a lesser extent, individuals, in the areas of insurance and reinsurance placements, risk of loss management, and management of employer sponsored benefit programs. Our risk management segment operations provide contract claim settlement, claim administration, loss control services and risk management consulting for commercial, nonprofit, captive and public sector entities, and various other organizations that choose to self-insure property/casualty coverages or choose to use a third party claims management organization rather than the claim services provided by underwriting enterprises. The corporate segment reports the financial information related to our debt and other corporate costs, clean energy investments, external acquisition related expenses and the impact of foreign currency translation. We do not assume insurance underwriting risk on a net basis, other than with respect to de minimis amounts necessary to provide minimum or regulatory capital to organize captives, pools, specialized underwriters or risk-retention groups. Rather, capital necessary for covering losses is provided by underwriting enterprises. Interest income, premium finance revenues and other income are primarily generated from our premium financing operations, our invested cash and restricted cash we hold on behalf of our clients, as well as clean energy investments. In addition, our share of the net earnings related to partially owned entities that are accounted for using the equity method is included in other income. We are a global insurance brokerage, risk management and consulting services firm, headquartered in Rolling Meadows, Illinois. We provide these services in approximately countries around the world through our owned operations and a network of correspondent brokers and consultants. We have prepared the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.

Twenty-five other acquisitions completed in 2024 

Common shares issued in connection with acquisitions are valued at closing market prices as of the effective date of the applicable acquisition or on the days when the shares are issued, if purchase consideration is deferred. We record escrow deposits that are returned to us as a result of adjustments to net assets acquired as reductions of goodwill when the escrows are settled. The maximum potential earnout payables disclosed in the foregoing table represent the maximum amount of additional consideration that could be paid pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement for the applicable acquisition. The amounts recorded as earnout payables, which are primarily based upon the estimated future operating results of the acquired entities over a two- to three-year period subsequent to the acquisition date, are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are included on that basis in the recorded purchase price consideration in the foregoing table. We will record subsequent changes in these estimated earnout obligations, including the accretion of discount, in our consolidated statement of earnings when incurred. The fair value of these earnout obligations is generally based on the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired entities in accordance with the provisions outlined in the respective purchase agreements, which is a Level 3 fair value measurement (discounted cash flow method of the income approach). In determining fair value, we estimated the acquired entity s future performance using financial projections developed by management for the acquired entity and market participant assumptions that were derived for revenue growth and/or profitability. Revenue growth rates generally ranged from to for our 2024 acquisitions. We estimated future payments using the earnout formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement and the financial projections just described. We then discounted these payments to present value using a risk-adjusted rate that takes into consideration market-based rates of return that reflect the ability of the acquired entity to achieve the targets. The discount rate was for all of our 2024 acquisitions. In some instances, the fair value of these earnout obligations can be based on other valuation methods including the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Method or Monte Carlo Simulation method. Changes in financial projections, market participant assumptions for revenue growth and/or profitability, or the risk-adjusted discount rate, would result in a change in the fair value of recorded earnout obligations.

million and million, respectively, of expense in our consolidated statement of earnings related to the accretion of the discount recorded for earnout obligations in connection with our acquisitions. During the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , we recognized million and million, respectively, of expense in our consolidated statement of earnings related to the accretion of the discount recorded for earnout obligations in connection with our acquisitions. In addition, during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , we recognized million and million of income, respectively, related to net adjustments in the estimated fair value of the liability for earnout obligations in connection with revised assumptions due to changes in interest rates, volatility and other assumptions and projections of future performance for and acquisitions, respectively. In addition, during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , we recognized million and million of income, respectively, related to net adjustments in the estimated fair value of the liability for earnout obligations in connection with revised assumptions due to changes in interest rates, volatility and other assumptions and projections of future performance for and acquisitions, respectively. The net adjustments in the three month period ended September 30, 2024, include changes made to the estimated fair value of the Willis Re acquisition earnout and reflect updated assumptions as of September 30, 2024. The aggregate amount of maximum earnout obligations related to acquisitions was million as of September 30, 2024 , of which million was recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 , based on the estimated fair value of the expected future payments to be made, of which approximately million can be settled in cash or stock at our option and million must be settled in cash.

Among other things, these acquisitions allow us to expand into desirable geographic locations, further extend our presence in the retail and wholesale insurance and reinsurance brokerage markets and increase the volume of general services currently provided. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the tangible net assets acquired at the acquisition date was allocated to goodwill, expiration lists, non-compete agreements and trade names in the amounts of million, million, million and million, respectively, within the brokerage and risk management segments.

million. The fair value of the tangible assets and liabilities for each applicable acquisition at the acquisition date approximated their carrying values. In general, the fair value of expiration lists was established using the excess earnings method, which is an income approach based on estimated financial projections developed by management for each acquired entity using market participant assumptions. Revenue growth and attrition rates generally ranged from to and to , respectively, for our 2023 acquisitions for which valuations were performed in 2024. We estimate the fair value as the present value of the benefits anticipated from ownership of the subject expiration list in excess of returns required on the investment in contributory assets necessary to realize those benefits. The rate used to discount the net benefits was based on a risk-adjusted rate that takes into consideration market-based rates of return and reflects the risk of the asset relative to the acquired business. The discount rates ranged from to for our 2023 acquisitions for which valuations were performed in 2024. The fair value of non-compete agreements was established using the profit differential method, which is an income approach based on estimated financial projections developed by management for the acquired company using market participant assumptions and various non-compete scenarios. Expiration lists, non-compete agreements and trade names related to our acquisitions are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives two to fifteen years for expiration lists, two to for non-compete agreements and two to for trade names), while goodwill is not subject to amortization. We use the straight-line method to amortize these intangible assets because the pattern of their economic benefits cannot be reasonably determined with any certainty. We review all of our identifiable intangible assets for impairment periodically (at least annually) and whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. In reviewing identifiable intangible assets, if the undiscounted future cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the respective (or underlying) asset, an indicator of impairment would exist and further analysis would be required to determine whether or not a loss would need to be charged against current period earnings as a component of amortization expense. Based on the results of impairment reviews during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 we wrote off million and million, respectively, of amortizable assets related to the brokerage segment. Based on the results of impairment reviews during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 , we wrote off million and million, respectively, of amortizable assets related to the brokerage segment. Of the million of expiration lists, million of non-compete agreements and million of trade names related to our acquisitions made during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 , million, million and million, respectively, are not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Accordingly, we recorded a deferred tax liability of million and a corresponding amount of goodwill in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, related to the nondeductible amortizable intangible assets. Our unaudited consolidated financial statements for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 include the operations of the entities acquired in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 from their respective acquisition dates.

Deferred contract costs 

Deferred revenue 

The unbilled receivables, which are included in accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily relate to our rights to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date. These are transferred to the receivables when the client is billed. The deferred contract costs represent the costs we incur to fulfill a new or renewal contract with our clients prior to the effective date of the contract. These costs are expensed on the contract effective date. The deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheet includes amounts that represent the remaining performance obligations under our contracts and amounts collected related to advanced billings and deposits received from customers that may or may not ultimately be recognized as revenues in the future. Deposits received from customers could be returned to the customers based on lesser actual transactional volume than originally billed volume.

Anti-dilutive stock-based awards of million shares were outstanding at each the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , which were excluded in the computation of the dilutive effect of stock-based awards for the nine-month periods then ended. These stock based awards were excluded from the computation because the exercise prices on these stock based awards were greater than the average market price of our common shares during the respective period, and therefore, would be anti dilutive to earnings per share under the treasury stock method. 

 million shares issued for full value awards (i.e., awards other than stock options or stock appreciation rights) will be counted one-for-one against the million share pool, and every share subject to a full value award in excess of such limit will count as shares against the pool. To the extent that shares subject to an outstanding award granted under either the LTIP or prior equity plans are not issued or delivered by reason of the expiration, termination, cancellation or forfeiture of such award or by reason of the settlement of such award in cash, then such shares will again be available for grant under the LTIP. The maximum number of shares available under the LTIP for restricted stock, restricted stock unit awards and performance unit awards settled with stock (i.e., all awards other than stock options and stock appreciation rights) was million at September 30, 2024. The LTIP provides for the grant of stock options, which may be either tax-qualified incentive stock options or non-qualified stock options and stock appreciation rights. The compensation committee determines the period for the exercise of a non-qualified stock option, tax-qualified incentive stock option or stock appreciation right, provided that no option can be exercised later than after its date of grant. The exercise price of a non-qualified stock option or tax-qualified incentive stock option and the base price of a stock appreciation right cannot be less than of the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the date of grant, provided that the base price of a stock appreciation right granted in tandem with an option will be the exercise price of the related option.

Under the provisions of the DEPP, we typically contribute cash in an amount approved by the compensation committee to a rabbi trust on behalf of the executives participating in the DEPP, and instruct the trustee to acquire a specified number of shares of our common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions based on participant elections. Distributions under the DEPP may not normally be made until the participant reaches age 62 (or the one-year anniversary of the date of the grant for participants over the age of 61 as of the grant date) and are subject to forfeiture in the event of voluntary termination of employment or termination for cause prior to then. DEPP awards are generally made annually in the first quarter. In addition, . All contributions to the plan (including sub-plans) deemed to be invested in shares of our common stock are distributed in the form of our common stock and all other distributions are paid in cash. Our common stock that is issued to or purchased by the rabbi trust as a contribution under the DEPP is valued at historical cost, which equals its fair market value at the date of grant or date of purchase. When common stock is issued, we record an unearned deferred compensation obligation as a reduction of capital in excess of par value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, which is amortized to compensation expense ratably over the vesting period of the participants. Future changes in the fair market value of our common stock owed to the participants do not have any impact on the amounts recorded in our unaudited consolidated financial statements. In the first quarters of 2024 and 2023, the compensation committee approved million and million, respectively, of awards in the aggregate to certain key executives under the DEPP that were contributed to the rabbi trust in the first quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively. We contributed cash to the rabbi trust and instructed the trustee to acquire a specified number of shares of our common stock on the open market to fund these 2024 and 2023 awards. During the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , we charged million and million, respectively, to compensation expense related to these awards. During the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , we charged million and million, respectively, to compensation expense related to these awards. In the first quarters of 2024 and 2023, the compensation committee approved million and million, respectively, of awards under the sub-plans referred to above, which were contributed to the rabbi trust in the first quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively.

During the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , cash and equity awards with an aggregate fair value of million and million, respectively, were vested and distributed to executives under the DEPP. We have a Deferred Cash Participation Plan (which we refer to as the DCPP), which is a non-qualified deferred compensation plan for certain key employees, other than executive officers, that generally provides for vesting and/or distributions no sooner than five years from the date of awards. Under the provisions of the DCPP, we typically contribute cash in an amount approved by the compensation committee to the rabbi trust on behalf of the executives participating in the DCPP, and instruct the trustee to acquire a specified number of shares of our common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions based on participant elections. In the first quarters of 2024 and 2023, the compensation committee approved million and million, respectively, of awards in the aggregate to certain key executives under the DCPP that were contributed to the rabbi trust in the first quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Each performance share award was equivalent to the value of one share of our common stock on the date such provisional award was approved. At the end of the performance period, eligible participants will receive a number of earned shares based on the growth in adjusted EBITDAC per share (as defined in our 2024 Proxy Statement). Earned shares for the 2024 and 2023 provisional awards will fully vest based on continuous employment through March 1, 2027 and March 15, 2026, respectively, and will be settled in unrestricted shares of our common stock on a one-for-one basis as soon as practicable thereafter. Performance share awards granted in 2023 to certain executive officers age or older are not subject to forfeitures upon such officers departure from the company after from date of grant. Performance share awards granted in 2024 to executive officers are not subject to forfeiture upon such officers departure from the company once they attain the age of . In each case, the awards vest on a pro rata basis based on the number of months rounded up during which the officer was employed during the performance period.

Cash Awards Pursuant to our Performance Unit Program (which we refer to as the Program), there were units granted in the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . The Program consists of a performance period based on our financial performance and a vesting period measured from January 1 of the year of grant. At the discretion of the compensation committee and determined based on our performance, the eligible officer or key employee will be granted a percentage of the provisional cash award units that equates to the EBITDAC growth achieved (as defined in the Program). At the end of the performance period, eligible participants will be granted a number of units based on achievement of the performance goal and subject to approval by the compensation committee. Granted units will fully vest based on continuous employment through the vesting period. and times the original value of the units determined as of the grant date. The fair value of the awarded units will be paid out in cash as soon as practicable. If an eligible employee leaves us prior to the vesting date, the entire award will be forfeited. On March 15, 2022, pursuant to the Program, the compensation committee approved provisional cash awards of million in the aggregate for future grants to our officers and key employees that are denominated in units units in the aggregate), each of which was equivalent to the value of one share of our common stock on the date the provisional award was approved.

For the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 , the amount excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness for our foreign exchange contracts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss was a loss of million and a gain of million, respectively. 

We estimate that approximately million of pretax gain currently included within accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into earnings in the next twelve months.

The amounts presented in the table above may not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements, because the actual timing of the future payments made may vary from the stated contractual obligation. Senior Notes, Note Purchase Agreements, Credit Agreement and Premium Financing Debt Facility - See Note 6 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements for a summary of the amounts outstanding under the Senior Notes, Note Purchase Agreements, the Credit Agreement and Premium Financing Debt Facility. Operating Lease Obligations - Our corporate segment s executive offices and certain subsidiary and branch facilities of our brokerage and risk management segments are located in a building we own at 2850 Golf Road, Rolling Meadows, Illinois, where we have approximately square feet of space. We generally operate in leased premises at our other locations. Certain of these leases have options permitting renewals for additional periods. In addition to minimum fixed rentals, a number of leases contain annual escalation clauses which are generally related to increases in an inflation index. We have leased certain office space to several non-affiliated tenants under operating sublease arrangements. In the normal course of business, we expect that certain of these leases will not be renewed or replaced. We adjust charges for real estate taxes and common area maintenance annually based on actual expenses, and we recognize the related revenues in the year in which the expenses are incurred. These amounts are not included in the minimum future rentals to be received in the contractual obligations table above. Outstanding Purchase Obligations - The amount disclosed in the contractual obligations table above represents the aggregate amount of unrecorded purchase obligations that we had outstanding at September 30, 2024. These obligations represent agreements to purchase goods or services that were executed in the normal course of business.

companies, all of which were accounted for using the acquisition method for recording business combinations. Substantially all of the purchase agreements related to these acquisitions contain provisions for potential earnout obligations. For all of our acquisitions made in the period from 2020 to 2024 that contain potential earnout obligations, such obligations are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are included on that basis in the recorded purchase price consideration for the respective acquisition. The amounts recorded as earnout payables are primarily based upon estimated future potential operating results of the acquired entities over a two- to three-year period subsequent to the acquisition date. The aggregate amount of the maximum earnout obligations related to these acquisitions was million, of which million was recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 based on the estimated fair value of the expected future payments to be made, of which approximately million can be settled in cash or stock at our option and million must be settled in cash. Off-Balance Sheet Debt - Our unconsolidated investment portfolio includes investments in enterprises where our ownership interest is between and , in which management has determined that our level of influence and economic interest is not sufficient to require consolidation. As a result, these investments are accounted for under the equity method. None of these unconsolidated investments had any outstanding debt at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023, that was recourse to us. At September 30, 2024 , we had posted letters of credit totaling million, in the aggregate, related to our self insurance deductibles, for which we had a recorded liability of million. We have an equity investment in a rent-a-captive facility, which we use as a placement facility for certain of our insurance brokerage operations. At September 30, 2024 , we had posted letters of credit totaling million to allow certain of our captive operations to meet minimum statutory surplus requirements plus additional collateral related to premium and claim funds held in a fiduciary capacity and letter of credit totaling million for collateral related to claim funds held in a fiduciary capacity by a recent acquisition. These letters of credit have never been drawn upon. Litigation, Regulatory and Taxation Matters - We routinely are involved in legal proceedings, claims, disputes, regulatory matters and governmental inspections or investigations arising in the ordinary course of or incidental to our business, including those noted below in this section. We record accruals in the unaudited consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. For the matters we disclose that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses, such an estimate is not possible or is immaterial, and we may be unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the application of non-monetary remedies, unless disclosed below. We currently believe that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, legal proceedings and government investigations are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or other adverse events could occur, including the payment of substantial monetary damages or an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways, precluding particular business practices or requiring other remedies, which may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial position. As previously disclosed, our IRC 831(b) (or micro-captive advisory services business has been under audit by the IRS since 2013. Among other matters, the IRS is investigating whether we have been acting as a tax shelter promoter in connection with these operations. Additionally, the IRS is conducting a criminal investigation related to IRC 831(b) micro-captive underwriting enterprises. We have been advised that we are not a target of the criminal investigation. We are fully cooperating with both matters. Contingent Liabilities - We purchase insurance to provide protection from errors and omissions (which we refer to as E O) claims that may arise during the ordinary course of business. Currently we retain the first million of each and every E O claim. In addition, we retain, in aggregate, up to another million between million and million, plus up to another million between million and million, and up to another million between million and million. We have historically maintained self-insurance reserves for the portion of our E O exposure that is not insured. We periodically determine a range of possible reserve levels using actuarial techniques that rely heavily on projecting historical claim data into the future. Our E O reserve in the September 30, 2024 consolidated balance sheet is above the lower end of the most recently determined actuarial range by million and below the upper end of the actuarial range by million. We can make no assurances that the historical claim data used to project the current reserve levels will be indicative of future claim activity. Thus, the E O reserve level and corresponding actuarial range could change in the future as more information becomes known, which could materially impact the amounts reported and disclosed herein.

million of previously earned tax credits. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a portion of these previously earned tax credits were refunded in 2019 for tax year 2018, according to a specific formula. Under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act), which was passed on March 27, 2020, we accelerated the refund of all remaining credits on April 17, 2020, and the remaining credits were refunded to us in the second quarter of 2020. In 2004, 2007 and 2009, the IRS examined several of these investments and all examinations were closed without any changes being proposed by the IRS. However, any future adverse tax audits, administrative rulings or judicial decisions could disallow previously claimed tax credits. Due to the contingent nature of this exposure and our related assessment of its likelihood, no reserve has been recorded in our September 30, 2024 consolidated balance sheet related to this exposure.

Fiduciary cash is included in fiduciary assets in our consolidated balance sheet. We have a qualified contributory savings and thrift 401(k) plan covering the majority of our domestic employees. For eligible employees who have met the plan s age and service requirements to receive matching contributions, we historically have matched of pre-tax and Roth elective deferrals up to a maximum of of eligible compensation, subject to federal limits on plan contributions and not in excess of the maximum amount deductible for federal income tax purposes. Beginning in 2021, the amount matched by the company will be discretionary and annually determined by management. Employees must be employed and eligible for the plan on the last day of the plan year to receive a matching contribution, subject to certain exceptions enumerated in the plan document. Matching contributions are subject to a graduated vesting schedule and can be funded in cash or company stock. We expensed (net of plan forfeitures) million and million related to the plan in the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. During 2023, our board of directors authorized the employer matching contribution on eligible compensation to the 401(k) plan for the 2023 plan year to be funded with our common stock, which was funded in February 2024. During 2022, our board of directors authorized the employer matching contribution on eligible compensation to the 401(k) plan for the 2022 plan year to be funded with our common stock, which was funded in February 2023.

 reportable segments: brokerage, risk management and corporate. The brokerage segment is primarily comprised of our retail and wholesale insurance and reinsurance brokerage operations. The brokerage segment (which comprises our retail property/casualty, wholesale, reinsurance, benefits and captive operations) generates revenues through commissions paid by underwriting enterprises and through fees charged to our clients. Our brokers, agents and administrators act as intermediaries between underwriting enterprises and our clients and we do not assume net underwriting risks. The risk management segment provides contract claim settlement and administration services for commercial, nonprofit, captive and public sector entities, and various organizations that choose to self-insure some or all of their property/casualty coverages and for underwriting enterprises that choose to outsource some or all of their property/casualty claims departments. These operations also provide claims management, loss control consulting and insurance property appraisal services. Revenues are principally generated on a negotiated per-claim or per-service fee basis. Our risk management segment also provides risk management consulting services that are recognized as the services are delivered. The corporate segment manages our clean energy and other investments. In addition, the corporate segment reports the financial information related to our debt and other corporate costs, external acquisition-related expenses and the impact of foreign currency remeasurements. Allocations of interest income and certain expenses are based on reasonable assumptions and estimates primarily using revenue, headcount and other information. We allocate the provision for income taxes to the brokerage and risk management segments using the local country statutory rates. Reported operating results by segment would change if different methods were applied.

Item 2.	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The discussion and analysis that follows relates to our financial condition and results of operations for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. Readers should review this information in conjunction with the September 30, 2024 unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes included in Item 1 of Part I of this quarterly report on Form 10 Q and the audited consolidated financial statements and notes, and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contained in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2023. 
 Prior Year Discussion of Results and Comparisons 
 For Information on fiscal third quarter 2023 results and similar comparisons, see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Form 10-Q for the fiscal three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023. 
 Information Regarding Non-GAAP Measures and Other 
 In the discussion and analysis of our results of operations that follows, in addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, we provide information regarding EBITDAC, EBITDAC margin, adjusted EBITDAC, adjusted EBITDAC margin, diluted net earnings per share, as adjusted (adjusted EPS), adjusted revenue, adjusted compensation and operating expenses, adjusted compensation expense ratio, adjusted operating expense ratio and organic revenue. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, the GAAP information provided in this quarterly report on Form 10 Q. We believe that these presentations provide useful information to management, analysts and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our results of operations and financial condition or because they provide investors with measures that our chief operating decision makers use when reviewing the company s performance. See further below for definitions and additional reasons each of these measures is useful to investors. Our industry peers may provide similar supplemental non-GAAP information with respect to one or more of these measures, although they may not use the same or comparable terminology and may not make identical adjustments. The non-GAAP information we provide should be used in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the GAAP information provided. As disclosed in our most recent Proxy Statement, we make determinations regarding certain elements of executive officer incentive compensation, performance share awards and annual cash incentive awards, partly on the basis of measures related to adjusted EBITDAC. 
 Adjusted Non-GAAP presentation - We believe that the adjusted non-GAAP presentation of the current and prior period information presented on the following pages provides stockholders and other interested persons with useful information regarding certain financial metrics that may assist such persons in analyzing our operating results as they develop a future earnings outlook for us. The after-tax amounts related to the adjustments were computed using the normalized effective tax rate for each respective period. 
 Adjusted measures - We define these measures as revenues (for the brokerage segment), revenues before reimbursements (for the risk management segment), net earnings, compensation expense and operating expense, respectively, each adjusted to exclude the following, as applicable: 

Net gains on divestitures, which are primarily net proceeds received related to sales of books of business and other divestiture transactions, such as the disposal of a business through sale or closure. 

Acquisition integration costs, which include costs related to certain large acquisitions (including the acquisitions of Willis Re, Buck, Cadence Insurance, Eastern Insurance and My Plan Manager), outside the scope of our usual tuck in strategy, not expected to occur on an ongoing basis in the future once we fully assimilate the applicable acquisition. These costs are typically associated with redundant workforce, compensation expense related to amortization of certain retention bonus arrangements, extra lease space, duplicate services and external costs incurred to assimilate the acquisition into our IT related systems. 

Transaction-related costs, which are associated with completed, future and terminated acquisitions. Costs primarily relate to the acquisitions of Willis Re, Buck, Cadence Insurance, Eastern Insurance and My Plan Manager. These include costs related to regulatory filings, legal and accounting services, insurance and incentive compensation. 

Workforce related charges, which primarily include severance costs (either accrued or paid) related to employee terminations and other costs associated with redundant workforce. 

Lease termination related charges, which primarily include costs related to terminations of real estate leases and abandonment of leased space. 

Acquisition related adjustments principally relate to changes in estimated acquisition earnout payables adjustments and acquisition related compensation charges. In addition, from time to time may include changes in balance sheet estimates arising from conforming accounting principles, purchase-related true-ups and other balance sheet adjustments made after the closing date; the net impact on the results for first quarter 2024 was approximately 

- 37 - 

26 million of revenues and approximately 28 million of compensation expense. 

Amortization of intangible assets, which reflects the amortization of customer/expiration lists, non-compete agreements, trade names and other intangible assets acquired through our merger and acquisition strategy, the impact to amortization expense of acquisition valuation adjustments to these assets as well as non-cash impairment charges. 

The impact of foreign currency translation, as applicable. The amounts excluded with respect to foreign currency translation are calculated by applying current year foreign exchange rates to the same period in the prior year. 

Effective income tax rate impact, which levelizes the prior year for the change in current year tax rates. 

Legal and tax related, which represents the impact of (a) adjustments in third quarter 2024 and 2023 related to costs associated with legal and tax matters, and (b) adjustments in second quarter 2023 related to additional U.K. income tax expense related to the non-deductibility of acquisition-related adjustments made in the quarter and costs associated with legal and tax matters. 

Adjusted ratios - Adjusted compensation expense and adjusted operating expense, respectively, each divided by adjusted revenues. 

Non-GAAP Earnings Measures 
 We believe that the presentation of EBITDAC, EBITDAC margin, adjusted EBITDAC, adjusted EBITDAC margin, adjusted EPS and adjusted net earnings for the brokerage and risk management segments, each as defined below, provides a meaningful representation of our operating performance. Adjusted EPS is a performance measure and should not be used as a measure of our liquidity. We also consider EBITDAC and EBITDAC margin as ways to measure financial performance on an ongoing basis. In addition, adjusted EBITDAC, adjusted EBITDAC margin and adjusted EPS for the brokerage and risk management segments are presented to improve the comparability of our results between periods by eliminating the impact of the items that have a high degree of variability. 
 EBITDAC and EBITDAC Margin - EBITDAC is net earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables and EBITDAC margin is EBITDAC divided by total revenues (for the brokerage segment) and revenues before reimbursements (for the risk management segment). These measures for the brokerage and risk management segments provide a meaningful representation of our operating performance for the overall business and provide a meaningful way to measure its financial performance on an ongoing basis. 

EBITDAC, as adjusted and EBITDAC Margin, as adjusted - Adjusted EBITDAC is EBITDAC adjusted to exclude net gains on divestitures, acquisition integration costs, workforce related charges, lease termination related charges, acquisition related adjustments, transaction related costs, legal and tax related costs and the period-over-period impact of foreign currency translation as applicable, and Adjusted EBITDAC margin is Adjusted EBITDAC divided by total adjusted revenues (defined above). These measures for the brokerage and risk management segments provide a meaningful representation of our operating performance, and are also presented to improve the comparability of our results between periods by eliminating the impact of the items that have a high degree of variability. 

EPS, as adjusted and Net Earnings, as adjusted - Adjusted net earnings have been adjusted to exclude the after-tax impact of net gains on divestitures, acquisition integration costs, the impact of foreign currency translation, workforce related charges, lease termination related charges, acquisition related adjustments, transaction related costs, amortization of intangible assets, legal and tax related costs and effective income tax rate impact, as applicable. Adjusted EPS is Adjusted Net Earnings divided by diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This measure provides a meaningful representation of our operating performance (and as such should not be used as a measure of our liquidity), and for the overall business is also presented to improve the comparability of our results between periods by eliminating the impact of the items that have a high degree of variability. 

Organic Revenues (a non-GAAP measure) - For the brokerage segment, organic change in base commission and fee revenues, supplemental revenues and contingent revenues exclude the first twelve months of such revenues generated from acquisitions and such revenues related to divested operations, which include disposals of a business through sale or closure, run-off of a business and the restructuring and/or repricing of programs and products in each year presented. These revenues are excluded from organic revenues in order to help interested persons analyze the revenue growth associated with the operations that were a part of our business in both the current and prior period. In addition, organic change in base commission and fee revenues, supplemental revenues and contingent revenues excludes the period over period impact of foreign currency translation to improve the comparability of our results between periods. For the risk management segment, organic change in fee revenues excludes the first twelve months of such revenues generated from acquisitions and such revenues related to divested operations in each year presented. In addition, change in organic 
 - 38 - 

growth in fee revenues excludes the period-over-period impact of foreign currency translation to improve the comparability of our results between periods. 
 These revenue items are excluded from organic revenues in order to determine a comparable, but non-GAAP, measurement of revenue growth that is associated with the revenue sources that are expected to continue in the current year and beyond, as well as eliminating the impact of the items that have a high degree of variability. We have historically viewed organic revenue growth as an important indicator when assessing and evaluating the performance of our brokerage and risk management segments. We also believe that using this non GAAP measure allows readers of our financial statements to measure, analyze and compare the growth from our brokerage and risk management segments in a meaningful and consistent manner. 
 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Information Presented to GAAP Measures - This quarterly report on Form 10 Q includes tabular reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures, as follows: for EBITDAC (on pages 47 and 54 ), for adjusted revenues, adjusted EBITDAC and adjusted diluted net earnings per share (on pages 41 and 42 ), for organic revenue measures (on pages 48 and 54 ), respectively, for the brokerage and risk management segments, for adjusted compensation and operating expenses and adjusted EBITDAC margin, (on pages 50 and 51 for the brokerage segment and (on pages 55 and 56 for the risk management segment. 
 Other Informa tion - Allocations of investment income and certain expenses are based on reasonable assumptions and estimates primarily using revenue, headcount and other information. We allocate the provision for income taxes to the brokerage and risk management segments using local statutory rates. We anticipate reporting an effective tax rate of approximately 24.5 to 26.5 in the brokerage segment and 25.0 to 27.0 in the risk management segment for the foreseeable future. Reported operating results by segment would change if different allocation methods were applied. 
 In the discussion that follows regarding our results of operations, we also provide the following ratios with respect to our operating results: pretax profit margin, compensation expense ratio and operating expense ratio. Pretax profit margin represents pretax earnings divided by total revenues. The compensation expense ratio is compensation expense divided by total revenues. The operating expense ratio is operating expense divided by total revenues. 
 Overview and Third Quarter 2024 Highlights 
 We are engaged in providing insurance brokerage, reinsurance brokerage, consulting services, and third-party property/casualty claims settlement and administration services to entities and individuals around the world. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, we generated approximately 65 of our revenues for the combined brokerage and risk management segments domestically and 35 internationally, primarily in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the U.K. We have three reportable segments: brokerage, risk management and corporate. The brokerage and risk management segments contributed approximately 86 and 14 , respectively, to revenues during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. The corporate segment did not generate any significant revenues in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. Our major sources of operating revenues are commissions, fees and supplemental and contingent revenues from brokerage operations and fees from risk management operations. Interest income is earned on cash, cash equivalents and fiduciary cash and revenues are generated from premium financing. 
 We use the Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers (which we refer to as CIAB) insurance pricing quarterly survey as an indicator of the insurance rate environment. The CIAB represents the leading domestic and international insurance brokers, who write approximately 85 of the commercial property/casualty premiums in the U.S. The third quarter 2024 survey had not been published as of the filing date of this report. The second quarter 2024 survey indicated that commercial property/casualty rates increased by 5.2 on average and we expect a similar trend to be noted when the CIAB's third quarter 2024 survey report is issued, which would indicate overall continued price firming and hardening in most lines of business. 
 We believe increases in property/casualty rates will continue for the remainder of 2024 and in 2025 due to rising loss costs, a firm reinsurance market, increased frequency of natural catastrophe and weather related losses, prior year reserve volatility and social inflation. U.S. hurricane losses in 2024, including losses from Helene and Milton, may cause insurance and reinsurance carriers to increase property catastrophe pricing upon renewal. Additionally, if loss trends deteriorate over the coming quarters, or if profitability concerns on casualty lines increase, it could lead to a more difficult rate and conditions environment in certain lines. The combination of increasing insurable values (due to inflation, including wage inflation), a tight labor market and low unemployment is likely contributing to increases in client insured exposures. Additionally, we expect that our history of strong new business generation, solid retentions and enhanced value added services for our carrier partners should all result in further organic growth opportunities around the world. Overall, we believe that in a positive rate environment with increasing exposures, our professionals can demonstrate their expertise and high quality, value-added capabilities by strengthening our clients insurance portfolios and delivering insurance and risk management solutions within our clients budgets. Based on our experience, insurance and reinsurance carriers appear to be making rational pricing decisions and are providing adequate capacity in the market for nearly all lines of coverage .

Results of Operations 
 Brokerage 
 The brokerage segment accounted for 86 of our revenues during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. Our brokerage segment is primarily comprised of retail, wholesale and reinsurance brokerage operations. Our brokerage segment generates revenues by: 
 (i) Identifying, negotiating and placing all forms of insurance coverage, as well as providing data analytics, risk-shifting, risk-sharing and risk-mitigation consulting services, principally related to property/casualty, life, health, welfare and disability insurance. We also provide these services through, or in conjunction with, other unrelated agents and brokers, consultants and management advisors; 

(ii) Identifying, negotiating and placing all forms of reinsurance coverage, as well as providing capital markets services, including acting as underwriter, with respect to insurance linked securities, weather derivatives, capital raising and selected merger and acquisition advisory activities; 

(iii) Acting as an agent or broker for multiple underwriting enterprises by providing services such as sales, marketing, selecting, negotiating, underwriting, servicing and placing insurance coverage on their behalf; 

(iv) Providing consulting services related to health and welfare benefits, voluntary benefits, executive benefits, compensation, retirement planning, institutional investment and fiduciary, actuarial, compliance, private insurance exchange, human resources technology, communications and benefits administration; and 

(v) Providing management and administrative services to captives, pools, risk-retention groups, healthcare exchanges, small underwriting enterprises, such as accounting, claims and loss processing assistance, feasibility studies, actuarial studies, data analytics and other administrative services. 

The primary source of revenues for our brokerage services is commissions from underwriting enterprises, based on a percentage of premiums paid by our clients, or fees received from clients based on an agreed level of service usually in lieu of commissions. Commissions are fixed at the contract effective date and generally are based on a percentage of premiums for insurance coverage or employee headcount for employer sponsored benefit plans. Commissions depend upon a large number of factors, including the type of risk being placed, the particular underwriting enterprise s demand, the expected loss experience of the particular risk of coverage, and historical benchmarks surrounding the level of effort necessary for us to place and service the insurance contract. Rather than being tied to the amount of premiums, fees are most often based on an expected level of effort to provide our services. In addition, under certain circumstances, both retail brokerage and wholesale brokerage services receive supplemental and contingent revenues. Supplemental revenue is revenue paid by an underwriting enterprise that is above the base commission paid, is determined by the underwriting enterprise and is established annually in advance of the contractual period based on historical performance criteria. Contingent revenue is revenue paid by an underwriting enterprise based on the overall profit and/or volume of the business placed with that underwriting enterprise during a particular calendar year and is determined after the contractual period. 
 Litigation, Regulatory and Taxation Matters 
 As previously disclosed, our IRC 831(b) (or micro-captive advisory services business has been under audit by the IRS since 2013. Among other matters, the IRS is investigating whether we have been acting as a tax shelter promoter in connection with these operations. Additionally, the IRS is conducting a criminal investigation related to IRC 831(b) micro-captive underwriting enterprises. We have been advised that we are not a target of the criminal investigation. We are fully cooperating with both matters.

Commissions and fees - The aggregate increase in base commissions and fees for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, was due to revenues associated with acquisitions that were made in the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2024 133.3 million), and to the organic change in base commissions and fee revenues. The organic change in base commissions and fee revenues were 5.4 and 9.6 for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 The aggregate increase in base commissions and fees for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, was due to revenues associated with acquisitions that were made in the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2024 508.2 million), and to the organic change in base commissions and fee revenues. The organic change in base commissions and fee revenues were 7.3 and 9.5 for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 In our property/casualty brokerage operations, during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 we saw continued strong customer retention, higher new business generation and increasing renewal premiums (premium rates and exposures). We believe these favorable trends should continue for the remainder of 2024; however, if economic conditions worsen or premium rate increases slow, we could see our revenue growth soften.

The 21.1 million increase in operating expense for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to expenses associated with the acquisitions completed in the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2024 17.9 million, additional investments in technology - 4.6 million, and increased workforce related charges 0.9 million, partially offset by a decrease in acquisition integration costs - 2.3 million. 
 
 The 81.7 million increase in operating expense for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to expenses associated with the acquisitions completed in the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2024 
 - 50 - 

64.2 million, underlying inflation of travel and entertainment costs and professional fees as well as additional investments in technology - 18.9 million, increases in workforce related charges - 0.7 million, partially offset by reduced acquisition integration costs - 2.1 million . 
 Depreciation - Depreciation expense increased in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 by 1.1 million and 7.7 million, respectively. The increase in depreciation expense in 2024 compared to 2023 was due primarily to the purchases of furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements related to office consolidations and moves, and expenditures related to upgrading computer systems. Also contributing to the increase in depreciation expense was the depreciation expense associated with acquisitions completed in the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Amortization - The increase in amortization expense in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 was primarily due to the impact of amortization expense of intangible assets associated with acquisitions completed in the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2024. Based on the results of impairment reviews during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 we wrote off 5.4 million and 19.4 million, respectively, of amortizable assets. Based on the results of impairment reviews during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 we wrote off 0.1 million and 3.3 million respectively, of amortizable assets. We review all of our intangible assets for impairment periodically (at least annually for goodwill) and whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. We perform such impairment reviews at the division (i.e., reporting unit) level with respect to goodwill and at the business unit level for amortizable intangible assets. In reviewing intangible assets, if the undiscounted future cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the respective (or underlying) asset, an indicator of impairment would exist and further analysis would be required to determine whether or not a loss would need to be charged against current period earnings as a component of amortization expense. Expiration lists, non compete agreements and trade names are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives (two to fifteen years for expiration lists, two to six years for non-compete agreements and two to fifteen years for trade names). 
 Change in estimated acquisition earnout payables - The change in the expense from the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023, was primarily due to adjustments made to the estimated fair value of earnout obligations related to revised assumptions due to rising interest rates and increased market volatility and projections of future performance. During the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized 13.7 million and 17.8 million, respectively, of expense related to the accretion of the discount recorded for earnout obligations in connection with our acquisitions made in the period from 2020 to 2024. During the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized 47.3 million and 57.1 million, respectively, of expense related to the accretion of the discount recorded for earnout obligations in connection with our acquisitions made in the period from 2020 to 2024. In addition, during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized 29.1 million and 20.4 million of income, respectively, related to net adjustments in the estimated fair value of earnout obligations in connection with revised assumptions due to changes in interest rates, volatility and other assumptions and projections of future performance for 29 and 20 acquisitions, respectively. In addition, during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized 60.2 million and 8.8 million of income, respectively, related to net adjustments in the estimated fair value of earnout obligations in connection with revised assumptions due to changes in interest rates, volatility and other assumptions and projections of future performance for 74 and 59 acquisitions, respectively. 
 The amounts initially recorded as earnout payables for our 2020 to 2024 acquisitions were measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are primarily based upon the estimated future operating results of the acquired entities over a two- to-three-year period subsequent to the acquisition date. The fair value of these earnout obligations is based on the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired entities in accordance with the provisions outlined in the respective purchase agreements. In determining fair value, we estimate the acquired entity s future performance using financial projections developed by management for the acquired entity and market participant assumptions that were derived for revenue growth and/or profitability. We estimate future earnout payments using the earnout formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement and these financial projections. Subsequent changes in the underlying financial projections or assumptions will cause the estimated earnout obligations to change and such adjustments are recorded in our consolidated statement of earnings when incurred. Increases in the earnout payable obligations will result in the recognition of expense and decreases in the earnout payable obligations will result in the recognition of income. 
 Provision for income taxes - The brokerage segment s effective income tax rates for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were 25.2 and 25.3 , respectively. The brokerage segment s effective income tax rates for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were 25.4 and 25.5 , respectively. We anticipate reporting an effective tax rate of approximately 24.5 to 26.5 in our brokerage segment based on known changes in tax rates in future periods.

Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests - The amounts reported in this line for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, include noncontrolling interest earnings of 1.5 million and 3.1 million, respectively. The amounts reported in this line for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, include noncontrolling interest earnings of 7.8 million and 5.9 million, respectively.

Risk Management 
 The risk management segment accounted for 14 of our revenue during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. Our risk management segment operations provide contract claim settlement, claim administration, loss control services and risk management consulting for commercial, nonprofit, captive and public sector entities, and various other organizations that choose to self-insure property/casualty coverages or choose to use a third-party claims management organization rather than the claim services provided by underwriting enterprises. Revenues for our risk management segment are comprised of fees generally negotiated (i) on a per-claim or per-service basis, (ii) on a cost-plus basis, or (iii) as performance-based fees. We also provide risk management consulting services that are recognized as the services are delivered. 
 Financial information relating to our risk management segment results for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023, is as follows (in millions, except per share, percentages and workforce data):

Fees - In our risk management operations, for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, new core workers' compensation and general liability claims arising improved from existing clients and new clients coming on board in 2023 and 2024. We believe these favorable new arising claim trends should continue for the remainder of 2024 however, worsening economic conditions or a reversal in the number of workers employed could cause fewer new liability and core workers' compensation claims to arise in future quarters. Organic change in fee revenues for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 6.0 compared to 17.9 for the same period in 2023. Organic change in fee revenues for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 8.9 compared to 16.8 for the same period in 2023.

Reimbursements - Reimbursements represent amounts received from clients reimbursing us for certain third-party costs associated with providing our claims management services. In certain service partner relationships, we are considered a principal because we direct the third party, control the specified service and combine the services provided into an integrated solution. Given this principal relationship, we are required to recognize revenue on a gross basis and service partner vendor fees in the operating expense line in our consolidated statement of earnings. 
 Interest income and other income - Interest income and other income primarily represents interest income earned on cash, cash equivalents and fiduciary cash. Interest income and other income in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 increased compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to increases in interest income from increases in interest rates earned on fiduciary cash.

The 25.4 million increase in compensation expense for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to compensation associated with the acquisitions completed in the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2024 9.3 million, increases in base and incentive compensation to service and support organic growth and higher benefit costs - 15.2 million in the aggregate, increases in workforce related charges - 0.6 million and acquisition integration costs - 0.4 million, partially offset by reduced acquisition earnout related adjustments - 0.1 million. 
 
 The 88.4 million increase in compensation expense for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to increases in base and incentive compensation and higher benefit costs - 64.6 million in the aggregate, compensation associated with the acquisitions completed in the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2024 22.3 million, increases in workforce related charges - 1.4 million and acquisition integration related costs - 0.2 million, partially offset by reduced acquisition earnout related adjustments 0.1 million.

The 6.0 million increase in operating expense for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to expenses associated with the acquisitions completed in the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2024 - 2.8 million, additional investments in technology - 2.1 million, increases in workforce related charges - 0.6 million, and an increase in acquisition integration costs - 0.5 million. 
 
 The 11.8 million increase in operating expense for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to expenses associated with the acquisitions completed in the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2024 - 8.4 million, increases in acquisition integration costs - 0.8 million and workforce related charges - 0.8 million, and increased technology spend, partially offset by savings in client-related expenses - 1.8 million in the aggregate. 
 Depreciation - Depreciation increased in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 by 0.8 million due to the true up of depreciation expense related to valuation adjustments made to acquired software on the My Plan Manager acquisition that was completed in December 2023. Depreciation expense also reflects expenditures related to upgrading computer systems, partially offset by the impact of office consolidations that occurred as leases expired in 2023 and 2022 (less depreciation associated with furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements). 
 Amortization - Amortization expense in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 increased by 2.2 million due to the normal recurring quarterly amortization expense. The amortization expense increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 by 5.5 million, primarily due to the acquisition of My Plan Manager. Provisional estimates of fair value were used by us to initially record the acquisition of My Plan Manager as of the acquisition date. We used an independent third party valuation specialist to assist us in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for this transaction that was completed in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. Based on the results of impairment reviews during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, no impairments were noted. 
 Change in estimated acquisition earnout payables - The change in expense from the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 to the same period in 2023, was due to accretion of the discount. During each of the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized 0.1 million of expense, related to the accretion of the discount recorded for earnout obligations in connection with our acquisitions. During the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized 0.3 million and 0.4 million, respectively, of expense, related to the accretion of the discount recorded for earnout obligations in connection with our acquisitions. 
 Provision for income taxes - The risk management segment s effective income tax rates for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were 26.5 and 26.4 , respectively. The risk management segment s effective income tax rates for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were 26.6 and 26.4 , respectively. We anticipate reporting an effective tax rate on adjusted results of approximately 25.0 to 27.0 in our risk management segment based on known changes in tax rates in future periods.

(4) Corporate pretax loss includes a net unrealized foreign exchange remeasurement loss of (14.9) million in third quarter 2024 and a net unrealized foreign exchange remeasurement gain of 1.4 million in third quarter 2023. Corporate pretax loss includes a net unrealized foreign exchange remeasurement loss of (16.5) million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 and a net unrealized foreign exchange remeasurement loss of (8.3) million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. 

Interest and banking costs and debt - Interest and banking costs includes expenses related to our debt. 
 Clean energy - For 2024, this consists of the operating results related to our investments in new clean energy projects. 
 Acquisition costs - Consists mostly of external professional fees and other due diligence costs related to our acquisitions. On occasion, we enter into forward currency hedges for the purchase price of committed, but not yet funded, acquisitions with funding requirements in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The gains or losses, if any, associated with these hedge transactions are also included in acquisition costs. 
 Corporate - Consists of overhead allocations mostly related to corporate staff compensation, other corporate level activities, and net unrealized foreign exchange remeasurement. In addition, it includes the tax expense related to partial taxation of foreign earnings, nondeductible executive compensation and entertainment expenses, the tax benefit from vesting of employee equity awards, as well as other permanent or discrete tax items not reflected in the provision for income taxes in the brokerage and risk management segments. The income tax benefit of stock-based awards that vested or were settled in the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was 76.8 million and 64.1 million, respectively, and is included in the table above in the Corporate line. 
 
 Clean energy investm ents - Please refer to our filings with the SEC, including Item 1A, Risk Factors, on pages 11 through 30 of our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, for a more detailed discussion of these and other factors that could impact the information above. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations. The insurance brokerage and risk management industries are not capital intensive. Historically, our capital requirements have primarily included dividend payments on our common stock, repurchases of our common stock, funding of our investments, acquisitions of brokerage and risk management operations and capital expenditures, including investments being made in IT software development projects. 
 Operating Cash Flows 
 Historically, we have depended on our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations to meet a substantial portion of our cash requirements. We believe that our cash flows from operations and borrowings under our Credit Agreement (as defined below) will provide us with adequate resources to meet our liquidity needs in the foreseeable future. To fund acquisitions made during 2023 and for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, we relied on a combination of net cash flows from operations, proceeds from borrowings under our Credit Agreement, and proceeds from issuances of senior unsecured notes and issuance of our common stock. 
 Cash provided by operating activities was 1,843.6 million and 1,338.1 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in cash provided by operating activities during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to growth in our core brokerage and risk management operations and timing differences between periods with cash receipts and disbursements related to accounts receivables and accrued compensation and other current liabilities compared to the same period in 2023. 
 During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 employee matching contributions to the 401(k) plan of 86.0 million relating to 2023 were funded using common stock. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, employee matching contributions to the 401(k) plan of 73.8 million relating to 2022 were funded using common stock. 
 When assessing our overall liquidity, we believe that the focus should be on net earnings as reported in our consolidated statement of earnings, adjusted for non cash items (i.e., EBITDAC), and cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows. Consolidated EBITDAC was 2,437.7 million and 2,041.3 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net earnings attributable to controlling interests were 1,204.4 million and 1,001.7 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We believe that EBITDAC items are indicators of trends in liquidity. 
 - 60 - 

Defined Benefit Pension Plan 
 Our policy for funding our defined benefit pension plan is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirements under the IRC. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (which we refer to as ERISA), could impose a minimum funding requirement for our plan. We are not required to make any minimum contributions to the plan for the 2024 plan year, nor were we required to make any minimum contributions to the plan for the 2023 plan year. Funding requirements are based on the plan being frozen and the aggregate amount of our historical funding. The plan s actuaries determine contribution rates based on our funding practices and requirements. Funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance, the level of discount rates and other variables impacting the assets and/or liabilities of the plan. In addition, amounts funded in the future, to the extent not due under regulatory requirements, may be affected by alternative uses of our cash flows, including dividends, acquisitions and common stock repurchases. We did not make any discretionary contributions to the plan during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. We are not considering making any discretionary contributions to the plan in 2024, but may be required to make minimum contributions to the plan in future periods. 
 Investing Cash Flows 
 Capital Expenditures - Capital expenditures were 98.3 million and 147.6 million for each of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In 2024, we expect total expenditures for capital improvements to be approximately 130.0 million, part of which is related to expenditures on office moves and investments being made in IT and software development projects. Capital expenditures decreased in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to less acquisition integration related expenditures, differences in the period over period timing of expenditures related to investments in information technology, and by the movement of information technology to cloud computing based technology from in house hosted environments. Expenditures made related to cloud computing based technology are accounted for as deferred costs versus fixed assets, which would reduce capital expenditures. 
 Acquisitions - Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash and restricted cash acquired, was 669.4 million and 1,183.6 million in the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In addition, during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, we issued 0.6 million shares 138.1 million) of our common stock as payment for a portion of the total consideration paid for 2024 acquisitions and earnout payments made in 2024. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, we issued 1.9 million shares 388.3 million) of our common stock as payment for consideration paid for 2023 acquisitions and earnout payments made in 2023. We completed twenty-eight and thirty-seven acquisitions in the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Annualized revenues of businesses acquired in the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled approximately 187.9 million and 475.3 million, respectively. For the remainder of 2024, we expect to use new debt, our Credit Agreement, cash from operations and our common stock, or a combination thereof to fund all of the acquisitions we complete. 
 If liquidity concerns arise, we may be more likely to issue common stock to fund acquisitions. 
 Dispositions - During each of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we sold several books of business and recognized net gains of 25.0 million and 5.9 million, respectively. We received net cash proceeds of 21.2 million and 6.2 million, respectively, in these 2024 and 2023 transactions. 
 Financing Cash Flows 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 4,550.0 million of Senior Notes, 3,523.0 million of corporate related borrowings outstanding, no borrowings outstanding under our Credit Agreement, 259.9 million of borrowings outstanding under our Premium Financing Debt Facility and a cash and cash equivalent balance of 2,022.4 million. 
 Consistent with past practice, as of September 30, 2024 we had pre-issuance hedges open for 200.0 million for 2025 and no contracts were closed during the three-month period September 30, 2024. 
 The Senior Notes, Note Purchase Agreements, the Credit Agreement and the Premium Financing Debt Facility contain various financial covenants that require us to maintain specified financial ratios. We were in compliance with these covenants at September 30, 2024. 
 Senior Notes - On February 12, 2024, we closed and funded an offering of 1,000.0 million of unsecured senior notes in two tranches. The 500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.45 Senior Notes is due in 2034 (which we refer to as the 2034 July Notes) and 500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.75 Senior Notes is due in 2054 (which we refer to as the 2054 July Notes). The weighted average interest rate is 5.71 per annum after giving effect to underwriting costs and a net hedge loss. During 2023, we entered into a pre-issuance interest rate hedging transaction related to these notes. We realized a net cash loss of approximately 1.4 million on the hedging transactions that will be recognized on a pro rata basis as an increase to our reported interest expense over ten years. We used the proceeds of these offerings to fund acquisitions, earnout payments related to acquisitions and general corporate purposes. 
 - 61 - 

On November 2, 2023, we closed and funded an offering of 1,000.0 million of unsecured senior notes in two tranches. The 400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.50 Senior Notes is due in 2034 (which we refer to as the 2034 Notes) and 600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75 Senior Notes is due in 2054 (which we refer to as the 2054 Notes). The weighted average interest rate is 5.97 per annum after giving effect to underwriting costs and a net hedge gain. During 2021 through 2023, we entered into a pre-issuance interest rate hedging transaction related to these notes. We realized a net cash gain of approximately 128.0 million on the hedging transactions that will be recognized on a pro rata basis as a decrease to our reported interest expense over ten years. We used the proceeds of these offerings to fund acquisitions, earnout payments related to acquisitions and general corporate purposes. 
 On March 2, 2023, we closed and funded an offering of 950.0 million of unsecured senior notes in two tranches. The 350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.50 Senior Notes is due in 2033 (which we refer to as the 2033 Notes) and 600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.75 Senior Notes is due in 2053 (which we refer to as the 2053 Notes). The weighted average interest rate is 5.05 per annum after giving effect to underwriting costs and a net hedge gain. During 2019 through 2022, we entered into a pre issuance interest rate hedging transaction related to these notes. We realized a net cash gain of approximately 112.7 million on the hedging transactions that will be recognized on a pro rata basis as a decrease to our reported interest expense over ten years. We used the proceeds of these offerings to fund acquisitions, earnout payments related to acquisitions and general corporate purposes. 
 Note Purchase Agreement - During February 2024, we used operating cash to fund the 100.0 million Series HH note maturity that had a fixed rate of 4.72 that was due February 13, 2024. 
 During February 2024, we used operating cash to fund the 325.0 million Series H note maturity that had a fixed rate of 4.58 that was due February 27, 2024. 
 During June 2023, we used operating cash to fund the 200.0 million Series N note maturity that had a fixed rate of 4.13 that was due June 24, 2023. 
 During June 2023, we used operating cash to fund the prepayment of the 50.0 million Series CC note that had a floating rate of 90 day LIBOR plus 1.40 , balloon that was originally due on June 13, 2024. 
 During February 2023, we used operating cash to fund the 50.0 million Series E note maturity that had a fixed rate of 5.49 that was due February 10, 2023. 
 Credit Agreement - On June 22, 2023, we entered into a new Credit Agreement (which we refer to as the Credit Agreement) with an administrative agent and a group of other lenders. The Credit Agreement provides for a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility in the amount of 1,200.0 million (including a 75.0 million letter of credit sub-facility), which is also available in Pounds Sterling, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars, New Zealand Dollars, Euros, Japanese Yen and any other currencies agreed by the lenders. On November 7, 2023, we entered into the First Amendment to the Credit Agreement, pursuant to which we increased the commitments under the Credit Agreement up to 1,700.0 million. 
 We use the Credit Agreement to post letters of credit and to borrow funds to supplement our operating cash flows from time to time. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, we borrowed an aggregate of 1,663.2 million and repaid 1,906.9 million. At September 30, 2024, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Due to outstanding letters of credit, 1,689.0 million remained available for potential borrowings under the Credit Agreement at September 30, 2024. Principal uses of the 2024 and 2023 borrowings under the Credit Agreement were to fund acquisitions, earnout payments related to acquisitions and general corporate purposes. 
 Premium Financing Debt Facility - On October 31, 2023, we entered into an amendment to our revolving loan facility (which we refer to as the Premium Financing Debt Facility), that provides funding for the three Australian (AU) and New Zealand (NZ) premium finance subsidiaries. The Premium Financing Debt Facility is comprised of: (i) Facility B, which is separated into AU 390.0 million and NZ 10.0 million tranches (the NZ tranche has been increased as of October 1, 2024 to NZ 25.0 million), (ii) Facility C, which is an AU 60.0 million equivalent multi-currency overdraft tranche and (iii) Facility D, which is a NZ 15.0 million equivalent multi-currency overdraft tranche. 
 At September 30, 2024, AU 365.0 million of borrowings were outstanding under Facility B, with no borrowings outstanding under the NZ tranche of Facility B. There were no borrowings outstanding under Facility C and NZ 14.9 million of borrowings were outstanding under Facility D, which in aggregate amount to US 259.9 million of borrowings outstanding under the Premium Financing Debt Facility.

Dividends - Our board of directors determines our dividend policy. Our board of directors determines dividends on our common stock on a quarterly basis after considering our available cash from earnings, our anticipated cash needs and current conditions in the economy and financial markets. 
 In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, we declared 396.7 million in cash dividends on our common stock, or 0.60 per common share, a 9 increase over the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. On October 23, 2024, we announced a quarterly dividend for third quarter 2024 of 0.60 per common share. This dividend level in 2024 will result in annualized net cash used by financing activities in 2024 of approximately 526.5 million (based on the number of outstanding shares as of September 30, 2024) or an anticipated increase in cash used of approximately 52.5 million compared to 2023. We make no assurances regarding the amount of any future dividend payments . 
 Shelf Registration Statement - On February 12, 2024, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, registering the offer and sale from time to time, of an indeterminate amount of debt securities, guarantees, common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depositary shares, purchase contracts, or units. The availability of the potential liquidity under this shelf registration statement depends on investor demand, market conditions and other factors. We make no assurances regarding when, or if, we will issue any securities under this registration statement. On November 15, 2022, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-4 with the with the SEC, registering 7.0 million shares of our common stock that we may offer and issue from time to time in connection with future acquisitions of other businesses, assets or securities. At September 30, 2024, 5.6 million shares remained available for issuance under this registration statement. 
 Common Stock Repurchases - We have in place a common stock repurchase plan approved by our board of directors in July 2021, that authorizes the repurchase of up to 1.5 billion of common stock. During the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not repurchase shares of our common stock. The plan authorizes the repurchase of our common stock at such times and prices, as we may deem advantageous, in transactions on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. We are under no commitment or obligation to repurchase any particular number of shares, and the plan may be suspended at any time at our discretion. Management may consider repurchasing common stock during the remainder of 2024 to the extent that our available cash exceeds acquisition opportunities. Funding for share repurchases may come from a variety of sources, including cash from operations, short-term or long term borrowings under our Credit Agreement or other sources. See Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities below for more information regarding shares repurchased during the quarter. 
 At-the-Market Equity Program - On March 14, 2024, we entered into an updated Equity Distribution Agreement with Morgan Stanley Co. LLC, pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time, up to 3,000,000 shares of our common stock through Morgan Stanley as sales agent. We intend to use the net proceeds of sales under this program to fund future acquisitions from time to time or for general corporate purposes. Pursuant to the agreement, shares may be sold by means of ordinary brokers transactions, including on the New York Stock Exchange, at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to the prevailing market prices, or at negotiated prices, in block transactions, or as otherwise agreed upon by us and Morgan Stanley. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we did not sell shares of our common stock under the program. 
 Common Stock Issuances - Another source of liquidity to us is the issuance of our common stock pursuant to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Proceeds from the issuance of common stock under these plans for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were 138.0 million and 100.0 million, respectively. On May 10, 2022, our stockholders approved the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan (which we refer to as the LTIP), which replaced our previous stockholder-approved 2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan. All of our officers, employees and non-employee directors are eligible to receive awards under the LTIP. Awards that may be granted under the LTIP include non-qualified and incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units and performance units, any or all of which may be made contingent upon the achievement of performance criteria. Stock options with respect to 11.0 million shares (less any shares of restricted stock issued under the LTIP - 2.5 million shares of our common stock were available for this purpose as of September 30, 2024) were available for grant under the LTIP at September 30, 2024. Our employee stock purchase plan allows our employees to purchase our common stock at 95 of its fair market value. Proceeds from the issuance of our common stock related to these plans have contributed favorably to net cash provided by financing activities in the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and we believe this favorable trend will continue in the foreseeable future. 
 We have a qualified contributory savings and thrift 401(k) plan covering the majority of our domestic employees. For eligible employees who have met the plan s age and service requirements to receive matching contributions, we historically have matched 100 of pre-tax and Roth elective deferrals up to a maximum of 5.0 of eligible compensation, subject to federal limits on plan contributions and not in excess of the maximum amount deductible for federal income tax purposes. Beginning with the match paid in 2021, the amount matched by the company will be discretionary and annually determined by management. Employees must be employed and eligible for the plan on the last day of the plan year to receive a matching contribution, subject to certain exceptions enumerated in the plan document. Matching contributions are subject to a five-year graduated vesting schedule and can be funded in

cash or company stock. We expensed (net of plan forfeitures) 81.7 million and 66.0 million related to the plan in the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During 2023, our board of directors authorized the 5.0 employer matching contribution on eligible compensation to the 401(k) plan for the 2023 plan year to be funded with our common stock, which we funded in February 2024. During 2022, our board of directors authorized the 5.0 employer matching contribution on eligible compensation to the 401(k) plan for the 2022 plan year to be funded with our common stock, which we funded in February 2023. 
 Outlook - We believe that we have sufficient capital and access to additional capital to meet our short- and long-term cash flow needs. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 There have been no changes in our critical accounting estimates, which include revenue recognition, income taxes and intangible assets/earnout obligations, as discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Business Combinations and Dispositions 
 See Note 3 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our business combinations during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. We did not have any material dispositions during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. 
 Item 3.	Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are exposed to various market risks in our day to day operations. Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices. The following analyses present the hypothetical loss in fair value of the financial instruments held by us at September 30, 2024 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The range of changes in interest rates used in the analyses reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one year period. This discussion of market risks related to our consolidated balance sheet includes estimates of future economic environments caused by changes in market risks. The effect of actual changes in these market risk factors may differ materially from our estimates. In the ordinary course of business, we also face risks that are either nonfinancial or unquantifiable, including credit risk and legal risk. These risks are not included in the following analyses. 
 Our invested assets are primarily held as cash and cash equivalents, which are subject to various market risk exposures such as interest rate risk. The fair value of our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 approximated its carrying value due to its short term duration. We estimated market risk as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates for the instruments contained in the cash and cash equivalents investment portfolio. The resulting fair values were not materially different from their carrying values at September 30, 2024. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 8,073.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our various senior notes and note purchase agreements. The aggregate estimated fair value of these borrowings at September 30, 2024 was 7,638.8 million due to their long term duration and fixed interest rates associated with these debt obligations. No active or observable market exists for our private placement long-term debt. Therefore, the estimated fair value of this debt is based on the income valuation approach, which is a valuation technique that converts future amounts (for example, cash flows or income and expenses) to a single current (that is, discounted) amount. The fair value measurement is determined on the basis of the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. Because our debt issuances generate a measurable income stream for each lender, the income approach was deemed to be an appropriate methodology for valuing the private placement long-term debt. The methodology used calculated the original deal spread at the time of each debt issuance, which was equal to the difference between the yield of each issuance (the coupon rate) and the equivalent benchmark treasury yield at that time. The market spread as of the valuation date was calculated, which is equal to the difference between an index for investment grade insurers and the equivalent benchmark treasury yield today. An implied premium or discount to the par value of each debt issuance based on the difference between the origination deal spread and market as of the valuation date was then calculated. The index we relied on to represent investment graded insurers was the Bloomberg Valuation Services (BVAL) U.S. Insurers BBB index. This index is comprised primarily of insurance brokerage firms and was representative of the industry in which we operate. For the purpose of our analysis, the average BBB rate was assumed to be the appropriate borrowing rate for us. 
 - 64 - 

We estimated market risk as the potential impact on the value of the debt recorded in our consolidated balance sheet based on a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in our weighted average borrowing rate at September 30, 2024 and the resulting fair values would have been 260.6 million higher than their carrying value (or 8,333.6 million). We estimated market risk as the potential impact on the value of the debt recorded in our consolidated balance sheet resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point increase in our weighted average borrowing rate at September 30, 2024 and the resulting fair values would have been 1,030.0 million lower than their carrying value (or 7,043.0 million). 
 At September 30, 2024, we had no borrowings outstanding under our Credit Agreement and 259.9 million of borrowings outstanding under our Premium Financing Debt Facility. The fair value of these borrowings approximate their carrying value due to their short term duration and variable interest rates associated with these debt obligations. Market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in our weighted average short-term borrowing rate at September 30, 2024, and the resulting fair value is not materially different from their carrying value. 
 We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily from one of our larger U.K. based brokerage subsidiaries that incurs expenses denominated primarily in British pounds while receiving a substantial portion of its revenues in U.S. dollars. Please see Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for additional information regarding potential foreign exchange rate risks arising from Brexit. In addition, we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk from our Australian, Canadian, Indian, Jamaican, New Zealand, Norwegian, Singaporean and various Caribbean and Latin American operations because we transact business in their local denominated currencies. Foreign currency gains (losses) related to this market risk are recorded in earnings before income taxes as transactions occur. Assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10 in the average foreign currency exchange rate for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 (a weakening of the U.S. dollar), earnings before income taxes would have increased by approximately 52.8 million. Assuming a hypothetical favorable change of 10 in the average foreign currency exchange rate for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 (a strengthening of the U.S. dollar), earnings before income taxes would have decreased by approximately 49.5 million. We are also subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the translation of local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars. We manage the balance sheets of our foreign subsidiaries, where practical, such that foreign liabilities are matched with equal foreign assets, maintaining a balanced book which minimizes the effects of currency fluctuations. However, our consolidated financial position is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to intra-entity loans between our U.S. based subsidiaries and our non-U.S. based subsidiaries that are denominated in the respective local foreign currency. A transaction that is in a foreign currency is first remeasured at the entity s functional (local) currency, where applicable, (which is an adjustment to consolidated earnings) and then translated to the reporting (U.S. dollar) currency (which is an adjustment to consolidated stockholders equity) for consolidated reporting purposes. If the transaction is already denominated in the foreign entity s functional currency, only the translation to U.S. dollar reporting is necessary. The remeasurement process required by U.S. GAAP for such foreign currency loan transactions will give rise to a consolidated unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss, which could be material, that is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (loss). 
 Historically, we have not entered into derivatives or other similar financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. However, with respect to managing foreign currency exchange rate risk in India, Norway and the U.K., we have periodically purchased financial instruments to minimize our exposure to this risk. During the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had several monthly forward contracts and options in place with an external financial institution that are designed to hedge a significant portion of our future Norway and the U.K. currency revenues through various future payment dates. In addition, during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had several monthly put/call options in place with an external financial institution that were designed to hedge a significant portion of our Indian currency disbursements through various future payment dates. Although these hedging strategies were designed to protect us against significant India, Norway and the U.K. currency exchange rate movements, we are still exposed to some foreign currency exchange rate risk for the portion of the payments and currency exchange rate that are unhedged. All of these hedges are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging , and periodically are tested for effectiveness in accordance with such guidance. In the scenario where such hedge does not pass the effectiveness test, the hedge will be re measured at the stated point and the appropriate loss, if applicable, would be recognized. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 there has been no such effect on our financial presentation. The impact of these hedging strategies was not material to our unaudited consolidated financial statements for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. See Note 11 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements for the changes in fair value of these derivative instruments reflected in comprehensive earnings at September 30, 2024.

Item 4.	Controls and Procedures 
 We carried out an evaluation required by the Exchange Act, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 During the most recent fiscal quarter, there has not occurred any change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives as specified above. Management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent or detect all errors and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.

(1) Amounts in this column include shares of our common stock purchased by the trustees of trusts established under our Deferred Equity Participation Plan, including sub-plans (which we refer to as the DEPP), our Deferred Cash Participation Plan (which we refer to as the DCPP) and our Supplemental Savings and Thrift Plan (which we refer to as the Supplemental Plan), respectively. These plans are considered to be unfunded for purposes of federal tax law since the assets of these trusts are available to our creditors in the event of our financial insolvency. The DEPP is an unfunded, non-qualified deferred compensation plan that generally provides for distributions to certain of our key executives when they reach age 62 or upon or after their actual retirement. Under sub-plans of the DEPP for certain production staff, the plan generally provides for vesting and/or distributions no sooner than five years from the date of awards, although certain awards vest and/or distribute after the earlier of fifteen years or the participant reaching age 65. See Note 9 to the September 30, 2024 unaudited consolidated financial

statements in this report for more information regarding the DEPP. The DCPP is an unfunded, non-qualified deferred compensation plan for certain key employees, other than executive officers, that generally provides for vesting and/or distributions no sooner than five years from the date of awards. Under the terms of the DEPP and the DCPP, we may contribute cash to the trust and instruct the trustee to acquire a specified number of shares of our common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. In the third quarter of 2024, we instructed the trustee for the DEPP and the DCPP to reinvest dividends on shares of our common stock held by these trusts and to purchase our common stock using cash that we contributed to the DCPP related to 2024 awards under the DCPP. The Supplemental Plan is an unfunded, non-qualified deferred compensation plan that allows certain highly compensated employees to defer compensation, including company match amounts, on a before-tax basis or after tax basis. Under the terms of the Supplemental Plan, all amounts credited to an employee s account may be deemed invested, at the employee s election, in a number of investment options that include various mutual funds, an annuity product and a fund representing our common stock. When an employee elects to have some or all of the amounts credited to the employee s account under the Supplemental Plan deemed to be invested in the fund representing our common stock, the trustee of the trust for the Supplemental Plan purchases shares of our common stock in a number sufficient to ensure that the trust holds a number of shares of our common stock with a value equal to all equivalent to the amounts deemed invested in the fund representing our common stock. We want to ensure that at the time when an employee becomes entitled to a distribution under the terms of the Supplemental Plan, any amounts deemed to be invested in the fund representing our common stock are distributed in the form of shares of our common stock held by the trust. We established the trusts for the DEPP, the DCPP and the Supplemental Plan to assist us in discharging our deferred compensation obligations under these plans. All assets of these trusts, including any shares of our common stock purchased by the trustees, remain, at all times, assets of the company, subject to the claims of our creditors in the event of our financial insolvency. The terms of the DEPP, the DCPP and the Supplemental Plan do not provide for a specified limit on the number of shares of common stock that may be purchased by the respective trustees of the trusts. 

(2) The average price paid per share is calculated on a settlement basis and does not include commissions. 

(3) Effective July 28, 2021, the board of directors approved a common stock repurchase plan of up to 1.5 billion of common stock. Repurchases of common stock may be effected from time to time through open market purchases, trading plans established in accordance with the SEC s rules, accelerated stock repurchases, private transactions or other means, depending on satisfactory market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The repurchase plan has no expiration date and we are under no commitment or obligation to repurchase any particular amount of our common stock under his plan. At our discretion, we may suspend the repurchase plan at any time.
