In exchange, we pay a license fee to YUM equal to of net system sales from both our Company and franchise restaurants. We own the intellectual property of Huang Ji Huang and Little Sheep and pay no license fee related to these concepts. In 1987, KFC was the first major global restaurant brand to enter China. As of September 30, 2024, there were KFC stores in China. We maintain a controlling interest of , , , and approximately in the entities that own and operate the KFCs in and around Shanghai, Beijing, Wuxi, Suzhou and Hangzhou, respectively.

In 2017, the Company acquired a controlling interest in the holding company of DAOJIA.com.cn Daojia ), an online food delivery service provider in China. This business was extended to also include a team managing the delivery services for restaurants, including restaurants in our system, with their results reported under our delivery operating segment.

The operating results of Shaofaner were included in our e-commerce business operating segment. The Company has reportable segments: KFC and Pizza Hut. Our non-reportable operating segments, including the operations of Lavazza, Huang Ji Huang, Little Sheep and Taco Bell, our delivery operating segment and our e-commerce business, are combined and referred to as All Other Segments, as these operating segments are insignificant both individually and in the aggregate.

equity interest in Hangzhou Catering for cash consideration of million. Hangzhou Catering holds a equity interest in Hangzhou KFC, of which the Company previously held a equity interest. Along with the investment, the Company also obtained two additional seats on the board of directors of Hangzhou KFC. Upon completion of the transaction, the Company directly and indirectly holds an approximately equity interest in Hangzhou KFC and has majority representation on the board, and thus obtained control over Hangzhou KFC and started to consolidate its results from the acquisition date. In addition to its equity interest in Hangzhou KFC, Hangzhou Catering operates Chinese dining restaurants under four time-honored brands and a food processing business. The Company applies the equity method of accounting to the equity interest in Hangzhou Catering excluding the Hangzhou KFC business and recorded this investment in Equity investments based on its then fair value. The Company elected to report its share of Hangzhou Catering s financial results with a one-quarter lag because its results are not available in time for the Company to record them in the concurrent period. The Company s equity earnings (losses) from Hangzhou Catering, net of taxes, were immaterial for both quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and both years to date ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and included in Equity in net earnings (losses) from equity method investments in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying amount of the Company s equity method investment in Hangzhou Catering was million and million, respectively, exceeding the Company s interest in Hangzhou Catering s underlying net assets by million and million, respectively. Substantially all of this difference was attributable to its self-owned properties and impact of related deferred tax liabilities determined upon acquisition, which is being depreciated over a weighted-average remaining useful life of . The purchase amount from Hangzhou Catering was immaterial for both quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and both years to date ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company s accounts payable and other current liabilities due to Hangzhou Catering were immaterial as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

equity interest in Sunner, a Shenzhen Stock Exchange-listed company. Sunner is China s largest white-feathered chicken producer and the Company s largest poultry supplier. In May 2021, a senior executive of the Company was nominated and appointed to Sunner s board of directors upon Sunner s shareholder approval. Through this representation, the Company participates in Sunner s policy making process. The representation on the board, along with the Company being one of Sunner s significant shareholders, provides the Company with the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of Sunner. As a result, the Company started to apply the equity method of accounting to the investment in May 2021 based on its then fair value. The Company elected to report its share of Sunner s financial results with a one-quarter lag because Sunner s results are not available in time for the Company to record them in the concurrent period. In the quarters and years to date ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company s equity income (losses) from Sunner, net of taxes, was immaterial and was included in Equity in net earnings (losses) from equity method investments in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income. The Company purchased inventories of million and million from Sunner for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the years to date ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company s accounts payable and other current liabilities due to Sunner were million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying amount of the Company s investment in Sunner was both million, exceeding the Company s interest in Sunner s underlying net assets by million and million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, million and million of these basis differences were related to finite-lived intangible assets determined upon acquisition, respectively, which are being amortized over the estimated useful life of . The remaining differences were related to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are not subject to amortization, as well as deferred tax liabilities impact. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the market value of the Company s investment in Sunner was million and million based on its quoted closing price, respectively. Meituan Dianping Meituan Investment In the third quarter of 2018, the Company subscribed for million, or less than , of the ordinary shares of Meituan, a delivery aggregator in China, for a total consideration of approximately million, when it launched its initial public offering on the HKEX in September 2018. In the second quarter of 2020, the Company sold million of the ordinary shares of Meituan. The Company accounts for the equity securities at fair value with subsequent fair value changes recorded in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The fair value of the investment in Meituan is determined based on the closing market price for the shares at the end of each reporting period. The fair value change, to the extent the closing market price of shares of Meituan as of the end of reporting period is higher than our cost, is subject to U.S. tax.

months, and product vouchers generally expire over a period of up to months. We recognize breakage revenue, which is the amount of prepaid stored-value products that is not expected to be redeemed, either (1) proportionally in earnings as redemptions occur, in situations where the Company expects to be entitled to a breakage amount, or (2) when the likelihood of redemption is remote, in situations where the Company does not expect to be entitled to breakage, provided that there is no requirement for remitting balances to government agencies under unclaimed property laws. The Company reviews its breakage estimates at least annually based upon the latest available information regarding redemption and expiration patterns. Our privilege membership programs offer privilege members rights to multiple benefits, such as free delivery and discounts on certain products. For certain privilege membership programs offering a pre-defined amount of benefits that can be redeemed ratably over the membership period, revenue is ratably recognized over the period based on the elapse of time. With respect to privilege membership programs offering members a mix of distinct benefits, including a welcome gift and assorted discount coupons with pre-defined quantities, consideration collected is allocated to the benefits provided based on their relative standalone selling price and revenue is recognized when food or services are delivered or the benefits expire. In determining the relative standalone selling price of the benefits, the Company considers likelihood of future redemption based on historical redemption pattern and reviews such estimates periodically based upon the latest available information regarding redemption and expiration patterns. Franchise Fees and Income Franchise fees and income primarily include upfront franchise fees, such as initial fees and renewal fees, and continuing fees. We have determined that the services we provide in exchange for upfront franchise fees and continuing fees are highly interrelated with the franchise right. We recognize upfront franchise fees received from a franchisee as revenue over the term of the franchise agreement or the renewal agreement because the franchise rights are accounted for as rights to access our symbolic intellectual property. The franchise agreement term is generally years for KFC and Pizza Hut, generally for Little Sheep and three to years for Huang Ji Huang. We recognize continuing fees, which are based upon a percentage of franchisee sales, as those sales occur. Revenues from Transactions with Franchisees Revenues from transactions with franchisees consist primarily of sales of food and paper products, advertising services, delivery services and other services provided to franchisees. The Company centrally purchases substantially all food and paper products from suppliers for substantially all of our restaurants, including franchisees, and then sells and delivers them to the restaurants. In addition, the Company owns seasoning facilities for its Chinese dining business unit, which manufacture and sell seasoning products to Huang Ji Huang and Little Sheep franchisees. The Company also provides delivery services to franchisees. The performance obligation arising from such transactions is considered distinct from the franchise agreement as it is not highly dependent on the franchise agreement and the customer can benefit from such services on its own. We consider ourselves the principal in this arrangement as we have the ability to control a promised good or service before transferring that good or service to the franchisees. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control over ordered items or services, generally upon delivery to the franchisees. For advertising services, the Company often engages third parties to provide services and acts as a principal in the transaction based on our responsibilities of defining the nature of the services and administering and directing all marketing and advertising programs in accordance with the provisions of our franchise agreements. The Company collects advertising contributions, which are generally based on certain percentage of sales from substantially all of our restaurants, including franchisees. Other services provided to franchisees consist primarily of customer and technology support services. Advertising services and other services provided are highly interrelated to franchise right, and are not considered individually distinct. We recognize revenue when the related sales occur. Other Revenues Other revenues primarily include i) sales of products to customers through e-commerce channels, sales of Lavazza coffee retail products beyond Lavazza coffee shops, and sales of our seasoning products to distributors, and ii) revenues from logistics and warehousing services provided to third parties through our supply chain network. Our segment disclosures also include revenues relating to delivery services that were provided to our Company-owned restaurants and, therefore, were eliminated for consolidation purposes. Other revenues are recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services.

months after being earned, may be redeemed for future purchases of KFC or Pizza Hut branded products or other products for free or at a discounted price. Points cannot be redeemed or exchanged for cash. The estimated value of points earned by the loyalty program members is recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time the points are earned, based on the percentage of points that are projected to be redeemed, with a corresponding deferred revenue liability included in Accounts payable and other current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and subsequently recognized into revenue when the points are redeemed or expire. The Company estimates the value of the future redemption obligations based on the estimated value of the product for which points are expected to be redeemed and historical redemption patterns and reviews such estimates periodically based upon the latest available information regarding redemption and expiration patterns .

days of the period in which the corresponding sales occur. Our provision of credit losses for accounts receivable is based upon the current expected credit losses CECL model. The CECL model requires an estimate of the credit losses expected over the life of accounts receivable since initial recognition, and accounts receivable with similar risk characteristics are grouped together when estimating CECL. In assessing the CECL, the Company considers both quantitative and qualitative information that is reasonable and supportable, including historical credit loss experience, adjusted for relevant factors impacting collectability and forward-looking information indicative of external market conditions. While we use the best information available in making our determination, the ultimate recovery of recorded receivables is also dependent upon future economic events and other conditions that may be beyond our control. Accounts receivable that are ultimately deemed to be uncollectible, and for which collection efforts have been exhausted, are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the ending balances of provision for accounts receivable were million and million, respectively, and amounts of accounts receivable past due were immaterial. 
 Subsequent to the separation, we are no longer required to pay YUM initial or renewal fees that we receive from franchisees. The Company did t incur any impairment losses related to costs to obtain contracts during any of the periods presented. Costs to obtain contracts were million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Contract Liabilities

Contract liabilities primarily consist of deferred revenue related to prepaid stored-value products, privilege membership programs, customer loyalty programs and upfront franchise fees. Deferred revenue related to prepaid stored-value products, privilege membership programs and customer loyalty programs is included in Accounts payable and other current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Deferred revenue related to upfront franchise fees that we expect to recognize as revenue in the next 12 months is included in Accounts payable and other current liabilities, and the remaining balance is included in Other liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Revenue recognized that was included in the contract liability balance at the beginning of each period amounted to million and million for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million for both years to date ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Changes in contract liability balances were not materially impacted by business acquisition, change in estimate of transaction price or any other factors during any of the periods presented. The Company has elected, as a practical expedient, not to disclose the value of remaining performance obligations associated with sales-based royalty promised to franchisees in exchange for franchise right and other related services. The remaining duration of the performance obligation is the remaining contractual term of each franchise agreement. We recognize continuing franchisee fees and revenues from advertising services and other services provided to franchisees based on a certain percentage of sales, as those sales occur.

properties in China for our Company-owned restaurants. We generally enter into lease agreements for our restaurants with initial terms of to . Most of our lease agreements contain termination options that permit us to terminate the lease agreement early if the restaurant profit is negative for a specified period of time. We generally do not have renewal options for our leases. Such options are accounted for only when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the options. The rent under the majority of our current restaurant lease agreements is generally payable in one of three ways: (i) fixed rent; (ii) the higher of a fixed base rent or a percentage of the restaurant s sales; or (iii) a percentage of the restaurant s sales. Most leases require us to pay common area maintenance fees for the leased property. In addition to restaurants leases, we also lease office spaces, logistics centers and equipment. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. In limited cases, we sub-lease certain restaurants to franchisees in connection with refranchising transactions or lease our properties to other third parties. The lease payments under these leases are generally based on the higher of a fixed base rent or a percentage of the restaurant s annual sales. Income from sub-lease agreements with franchisees or lease agreements with other third parties are included in Franchise fees and income and Other revenues, respectively, within our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.

The lease concessions were primarily in the form of rent reduction over the period of time when the Company s restaurant business was adversely impacted. The Company applied the interpretive guidance in a FASB staff question-and-answer document issued in April 2020 and elected: (1) not to evaluate whether a concession received in response to the COVID-19 pandemic is a lease modification and (2) to assume such concession was contemplated as part of the existing lease contract with no contract modification. Such concession was recognized as negative variable lease cost in the period the concession was granted. The Company was no longer granted such lease concession beginning in 2024.

Effective tax rate 

The lower effective tax rate for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the impact from fair value change of our investment in Meituan. The lower effective tax rate for the year to date ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the favorable impact from the reduction of certain non-deductible items and the impact from fair value change of our investment in Meituan. In December 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act ), which included a broad range of tax reforms. The Tax Act requires a U.S. shareholder to be subject to tax on Global Intangible Low Taxed Income GILTI earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. We have elected the option to account for current year GILTI tax as a period cost as incurred, and therefore included it in estimating the annual effective tax rate. In August 2022, the IRA was signed into law in the U.S., which contains certain tax measures, including a Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax CAMT of on certain large corporations. On December 27, 2022, the U.S. Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Services (the IRS released Notice 2023-7, announcing their intention to issue proposed regulations addressing the application of the new CAMT. In 2023 and 2024, additional notices or proposed regulations were released to continue to provide interim guidance regarding certain CAMT issues before proposed regulations are published. The Company will monitor the regulatory developments and continue to evaluate the impact on our financial statements, if any.

global minimum tax applied on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis and for which many jurisdictions have now committed to an effective enactment date starting January 1, 2024. The Company will monitor the regulatory developments and continue to evaluate the impact, if any. We are subject to reviews, examinations and audits by Chinese tax authorities, the IRS and other tax authorities with respect to income and non-income based taxes. Since 2016, we have been under a national audit on transfer pricing by the Chinese State Taxation Administration (the STA in China regarding our related party transactions for the period from 2006 to 2015. The information and views currently exchanged with the tax authorities focus on our franchise arrangement with YUM. We continue to provide information requested by the tax authorities to the extent it is available to the Company. It is reasonably possible that there could be significant developments, including expert review and assessment by the STA, within the next 12 months. The ultimate assessment and decision of the STA will depend upon further review of the information provided, as well as ongoing technical and other discussions with the STA and in-charge local tax authorities, and therefore, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the potential impact at this time. We will continue to defend our transfer pricing position. However, if the STA prevails in the assessment of additional tax due based on its ruling, the assessed tax, interest and penalties, if any, could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Our non-reportable operating segments, including the operations of Lavazza, Huang Ji Huang, Little Sheep and Taco Bell, our delivery operating segment and our e-commerce business, are combined and referred to as All Other Segments, as these operating segments are insignificant both individually and in the aggregate.

tax assessed on the difference between the fair market value and the tax basis of the separated China business. As YUM s tax basis in the China business is minimal, the amount of such a tax could be significant. Any tax liability arising from the application of Bulletin 7 to the distribution is expected to be settled in accordance with the tax matters agreement between the Company and YUM. Pursuant to the tax matters agreement, to the extent any Chinese indirect transfer tax pursuant to Bulletin 7 is imposed, such tax and related losses will be allocated between YUM and the Company in proportion to their respective share of the combined market capitalization of YUM and the Company during the 30 trading days after the separation. Such a settlement could be significant and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition. At the inception of the tax indemnity being provided to YUM, the fair value of the non-contingent obligation to stand ready to perform was insignificant and the liability for the contingent obligation to make payment was not probable or estimable. Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to various lawsuits covering a variety of allegations from time to time. The Company believes that the ultimate liability, if any, in excess of amounts already provided for these matters in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Matters faced by the Company from time to time include, but are not limited to, claims from landlords, employees, customers and others related to operational, contractual or employment issues.

 Introduction 
 
 Yum China Holdings, Inc. is the largest restaurant company in China in terms of 2023 system sales, with 15,861 restaurants covering around 2,200 cities primarily in China as of September 30, 2024. Our growing restaurant network consists of our flagship KFC and Pizza Hut brands, as well as emerging brands such as Lavazza, Huang Ji Huang, Little Sheep and Taco Bell. We have the exclusive right to operate and sublicense the KFC, Pizza Hut and, subject to achieving certain agreed-upon milestones, Taco Bell brands in China (excluding Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan), and own the intellectual property of the Little Sheep and Huang Ji Huang concepts outright. We also established a joint venture with Lavazza Group, the world-renowned family-owned Italian coffee company, to explore and develop the Lavazza coffee concept in China. KFC was the first major global restaurant brand to enter China in 1987. With more than 35 years of operations, we have developed extensive operating experience in the China market. We believe that there are significant opportunities to further expand within China, and we intend to focus our efforts on increasing our geographic footprint in both existing and new cities. 
 
 KFC is the leading and the largest quick-service restaurant QSR brand in China in terms of system sales. As of September 30, 2024, KFC operated 11,283 restaurants in around 2,200 cities across China. 
 
 Pizza Hut is the leading and the largest casual dining restaurant CDR brand in China in terms of system sales and number of restaurants. As of September 30, 2024, Pizza Hut operated 3,606 restaurants in over 800 cities. 
 
 Overview 
 
 We intend for this MD A to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our results of operations, including metrics that management uses to assess the Company s performance. Throughout this MD A, we discuss the following performance metrics: 
 
 Certain performance metrics and non-GAAP measures are presented excluding the impact of foreign currency translation F/X ). These amounts are derived by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. We believe the elimination of the F/X impact provides better year-to-year comparability without the distortion of foreign currency fluctuations. 

System sales growth reflects the results of all restaurants regardless of ownership, including Company-owned and franchise restaurants, except for sales from non-Company-owned restaurants for which we do not receive a sales-based royalty. Sales of franchise restaurants typically generate ongoing franchise fees for the Company at an average rate of approximately 6 of system sales. Franchise restaurant sales are not included in Company sales in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income; however, the franchise fees are included in the Company s revenues. We believe system sales growth is useful to investors as a significant indicator of the overall strength of our business as it incorporates all of our revenue drivers, Company and franchise same-store sales as well as net unit growth. 

Effective January 1, 2018, the Company revised its definition of same-store sales growth to represent the estimated percentage change in sales of food of all restaurants in the Company system that have been open prior to the first day of our prior fiscal year, excluding the period during which stores are temporarily closed. We refer to these as our base stores. Previously, same-store sales growth represented the estimated percentage change in sales of all restaurants in the Company system that have been open for one year or more, including stores temporarily closed, and the base stores changed on a rolling basis from month to month. This revision was made to align with how management measures performance internally and focuses on trends of a more stable base of stores. 

Company sales represent revenues from Company-owned restaurants. Within the analysis of Company sales, Total revenue and Restaurant profit, store portfolio actions represent the net impact from new-unit openings, acquisitions, refranchising and store closures. Net new unit contribution represents net revenue growth primarily from store portfolio actions excluding temporary store closures. Other primarily represents the impact of same-store sales as well as the impact of changes in restaurant operating costs such as inflation/deflation.

 (a) System Sales and Same-Store Sales growth percentages as shown in the table exclude the impact of F/X. Effective January 1, 2018, temporary store closures are normalized in the same-store sales calculation by excluding the period during which stores are temporarily closed. 

(b) See Non-GAAP Measures below for definitions and reconciliations of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP measures. 

(c) OP margin is defined as Operating Profit divided by Total revenues. 

As compared to the third quarter of 2023, Total revenues in the third quarter of 2024 increased 5 , or 4 excluding the impact of F/X. Total revenues for the year to date ended September 30, 2024 increased 3 , or 5 excluding the impact of F/X. The increase in Total revenues for the quarter and year to date ended September 30, 2024, excluding the impact of F/X, was driven by 7 and 8 net new unit contribution, respectively, partially offset by same-store sales decline, resulting from lower ticket average and same-store transaction growth. 
 
 Operating profit for the third quarter increased 15 , or 14 excluding the impact of F/X. Operating profit for the year to date ended September 30, 2024 increased 1 , or 5 excluding the impact of F/X. Further excluding the lapping impact from the VAT deductions and temporary relief from landlords and government agencies received in prior year, the increase in Operating profit for the quarter and year to date ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by the increase in Total revenues, operational efficiency improvement, favorable commodity prices, lower advertising expenses and lower performance-based compensation costs, offset by increased value-for-money offerings and wage inflation in the low single digits.

Non-GAAP Measures 
 
 In addition to the results provided in accordance with GAAP throughout this MD A, the Company provides the following non-GAAP measures: 
 Measures adjusted for Special Items, which include Adjusted Operating Profit, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Earnings Per Common Share EPS ), Adjusted Effective Tax Rate and Adjusted EBITDA; 

Company Restaurant Profit Restaurant profit and Restaurant margin; 

Core Operating Profit and Core OP margin, which exclude Special Items, and further adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability and the impact of F/X; 

These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present results, excluding those items that the Company does not believe are indicative of our core operations. 
 
 With respect to non-GAAP measures adjusted for Special Items, the Company excludes impact from Special Items for the purpose of evaluating performance internally and uses them as factors in determining compensation for certain employees. Special Items are not included in any of our segment results. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income including noncontrolling interests adjusted for equity in net earnings (losses) from equity method investments, income tax, interest income, net, investment gain or loss, depreciation and amortization, store impairment charges, and Special Items. Store impairment charges included as an adjustment item in Adjusted EBITDA primarily resulted from our semi-annual impairment evaluation of long-lived assets of individual restaurants, and additional impairment evaluation whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. If these restaurant-level assets were not impaired, depreciation of the assets would have been recorded and included in EBITDA. Therefore, store impairment charges were a non-cash item similar to depreciation and amortization of our long-lived assets of restaurants. The Company believes that investors and analysts may find it useful in measuring operating performance without regard to such non-cash items. 
 
 Restaurant profit is defined as Company sales less expenses incurred directly by our Company-owned restaurants in generating Company sales, including cost of food and paper, restaurant-level payroll and employee benefits, rent, depreciation and amortization of restaurant-level assets, advertising expenses, and other operating expenses. Company restaurant margin percentage is defined as Restaurant profit divided by Company sales. We also use Restaurant profit and Restaurant margin for the purpose of internally evaluating the performance of our Company-owned restaurants and we believe they provide useful information to investors as to the profitability of our Company-owned restaurants. 
 
 Core Operating Profit is defined as Operating Profit adjusted for Special Items, and further excluding Items Affecting Comparability and the impact of F/X. We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Items such as charges, gains and accounting changes, which are viewed by management as significantly impacting the current period or the comparable period, due to changes in policy or other external factors, or non-cash items pertaining to underlying activities that are different from or unrelated to our core operations, are generally considered Items Affecting Comparability. Examples of Items Affecting Comparability include, but are not limited to: temporary relief from landlords and government agencies; VAT deductions due to tax policy changes; and amortization of reacquired franchise rights recognized upon acquisitions. We believe presenting Core Operating Profit provides additional information to further enhance comparability of our operating results and we use this measure for purposes of evaluating the performance of our core operations. Core OP margin is defined as Core Operating Profit divided by Total revenues, excluding the impact of F/X.

(1) In February 2020, the Company granted Partner PSU Awards to select employees who were deemed critical to the Company s execution of its strategic operating plan. These PSU awards will only vest if threshold performance goals are achieved over a four-year performance period, with the payout ranging from 0 to 200 of the target number of shares subject to the PSU awards. These awards vested as of December 31, 2023 with a payout in the first quarter of 2024. Partner PSU Awards were granted to address increased competition for executive talent, motivate transformational performance and encourage management retention. Given the unique nature of these grants, the Compensation Committee does not intend to grant similar special grants to the same employees during the performance period. The impact from these special awards is excluded from metrics that management uses to assess the Company s performance. 

(2) Tax effect was determined based upon the nature, as well as the jurisdiction, of each Special Item at the applicable tax rate.

Details of Items Affecting Comparability are presented below: 
 (a) In relation to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company was granted lease concessions from landlords. The lease concessions were primarily in the form of rent reduction over the period of time when the Company s restaurant business was adversely impacted. Such concessions were primarily recognized as a reduction of Occupancy and other operating expenses within Company restaurant expenses included in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income in the period the concession was granted. See Note 10 for additional information. 

31 

(b) In relation to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company received government subsidies for employee benefits and providing training to employees. The temporary relief was primarily recognized as a reduction to Payroll and employee benefits within Company restaurant expenses included in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income. 

(c) Pursuant to the tax policy issued by relevant government authorities, general VAT taxpayers in certain industries that meet certain criteria are allowed to claim an additional 10 or 15 input VAT, which will be used to offset their VAT payables. This VAT policy was further extended to December 31, 2023 but the additional deduction was reduced to 5 or 10 respectively. VAT deductions were primarily recorded as a reduction to Food and paper and Occupancy and other operating expenses within Company restaurant expenses included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Such preferential policy was not extended in 2024. See Significant Known Events, Trends or Uncertainties Expected to Impact Future Results session within MD A for additional information on VAT deductions. 

(d) As a result of the acquisition of our previously unconsolidated joint ventures of Hangzhou KFC, Suzhou KFC and Wuxi KFC, 66 million, 61 million and 61 million of the purchase price were allocated to intangible assets related to reacquired franchise rights, respectively, which were amortized over the remaining franchise contract period of 1 year, 2.4 years and 5 years, respectively. The reacquired franchise rights were fully amortized as of March 31, 2023. The amortization was recorded in Other (income) expenses, net included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.

Revenues from Transactions with Franchisees 
 
 Revenues from transactions with franchisees primarily include revenues derived from the Company s central procurement model, whereby food and paper products are centrally purchased and then mainly sold to KFC and Pizza Hut franchisees. The quarter and year to date increase, excluding the impact of F/X, was mainly due to the increase in system sales for franchisees primarily driven by acceleration of franchise store openings. 
 
 G A Expenses 
 
 The quarter and year to date decrease in Corporate G A expenses, excluding the impact of F/X, was primarily due to lower performance-based compensation costs and improvement in operational efficiency. 
 
 Interest Income, Net 
 
 The quarter and year to date decrease in interest income, excluding the impact of F/X, was primarily driven by lower investment balance during the year. 
 
 Investment Gain (Loss) 
 
 The investment gain (loss) mainly relates to the change in fair value of our investment in Meituan. See Note 3 for additional information. 
 
 37 

Income Tax Provision 
 
 Our income tax provision primarily includes tax on our earnings generally at the Chinese statutory tax rate of 25 with certain Chinese subsidiaries qualified for preferential tax rates, withholding tax on planned or actual repatriation of earnings outside of China, Hong Kong profits tax, and U.S. corporate income tax, if any. The lower effective tax rate for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the impact from fair value change of our investment in Meituan. The lower effective tax rate for the year to date ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the favorable impact from the reduction of certain non-deductible items and the impact from fair value change of our investment in Meituan. 

Significant Known Events, Trends or Uncertainties Expected to Impact Future Results 
 
 Tax Examination on Transfer Pricing 
 
 We are subject to reviews, examinations and audits by Chinese tax authorities, the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities with respect to income and non-income based taxes. Since 2016, we have been under a national audit on transfer pricing by the STA in China regarding our related party transactions for the period from 2006 to 2015. The information and views currently exchanged with the tax authorities focus on our franchise arrangement with YUM. We continue to provide information requested by the tax authorities to the extent it is available to the Company. It is reasonably possible that there could be significant developments, including expert review and assessment by the STA, within the next 12 months. The ultimate assessment and decision of the STA will depend upon further review of the information provided, as well as ongoing technical and other discussions with the STA and in-charge local tax authorities, and therefore it is not possible to reasonably estimate the potential impact at this time. We will continue to defend our transfer pricing position. However, if the STA prevails in the assessment of additional tax due based on its ruling, the assessed tax, interest and penalties, if any, could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 PRC Value-Added Tax VAT 
 
 Effective May 1, 2016, a 6 output VAT replaced the 5 business tax BT previously applied to certain restaurant sales. Input VAT would be creditable to the aforementioned 6 output VAT. Our new retail business is generally subject to VAT rates at 9 or 13 . The latest VAT rates imposed on our purchase of materials and services included 13 , 9 and 6 , which were gradually changed from 17 , 13 , 11 and 6 since 2017. These rate changes impact our input VAT on all materials and certain services, mainly including construction, transportation and leasing. However, the impact on our operating results is not expected to be significant. 
 
 Entities that are general VAT taxpayers are permitted to offset qualified input VAT paid to suppliers against their output VAT upon receipt of appropriate supplier VAT invoices on an entity-by-entity basis. When the output VAT exceeds the input VAT, the difference is remitted to tax authorities, usually on a monthly basis; whereas when the input VAT exceeds the output VAT, the difference is treated as a VAT asset which can be carried forward indefinitely to offset future net VAT payables. VAT related to purchases and sales which have not been settled at the balance sheet date is disclosed separately as an asset and liability, respectively, in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. At each balance sheet date, the Company reviews the outstanding balance of any VAT asset for recoverability, giving consideration to the indefinite life of VAT assets as well as its forecasted operating results and capital spending, which inherently includes significant assumptions that are subject to change. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has not made an allowance for the recoverability of VAT assets, as the balance is expected to be utilized to offset against VAT payables or be refunded in the future. 
 
 On June 7, 2022, the Chinese Ministry of Finance MOF and the STA jointly issued Circular [2022] No. 21, to extend full VAT credit refunds to more sectors and increase the frequency for accepting taxpayers applications. Beginning on July 1, 2022, entities engaged in providing catering services in China are allowed to apply for a lump sum refund of VAT assets accumulated prior to March 31, 2019. In addition, VAT assets accumulated after March 31, 2019 can be refunded on a monthly basis. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, VAT assets of 110 million, VAT assets of 7 million and net VAT payable of 7 million were recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets, Other assets and Accounts payable and other current liabilities, respectively, in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 The Company will continue to review the classification of VAT assets at each balance sheet date, giving consideration to different local implementation practices of refunding VAT assets and the outcome of potential administrative reviews.

Pursuant to Circular [2019] No. 39, Circular [2019] No. 87 and Circular [2022] No. 11 jointly issued by relevant government authorities, including the MOF and the STA, from April 1, 2019 to December 31, 2022, general VAT taxpayers in certain industries that meet certain criteria were allowed to claim an additional 10 or 15 input VAT, which were used to offset their VAT payables. Pursuant to Circular [2023] No. 1 jointly issued by the MOF and the STA in January 2023, such VAT policy was further extended to December 31, 2023 but the additional deduction was reduced to 5 or 10 respectively. Accordingly, we recognized such VAT deductions of 42 million in the year to date ended September 30, 2023. The VAT deductions were recorded as a reduction to the related expense item, primarily in Company restaurant expenses included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Such preferential VAT policy was not extended in 2024. 
 
 We have been benefiting from the retail tax structure reform since it was implemented on May 1, 2016. However, the amount of our expected benefit from this VAT regime depends on a number of factors, some of which are outside of our control. The interpretation and application of the new VAT regime are not settled at some local governmental levels. In addition, China is in the process of enacting the prevailing VAT regulations into a national VAT law. However, the timetable for enacting the national VAT law is not clear. As a result, for the foreseeable future, the benefit of this significant and complex VAT reform has the potential to fluctuate from period to period. 
 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate 
 
 The reporting currency of the Company is the US . Most of the revenues, costs, assets and liabilities of the Company are denominated in Chinese Renminbi RMB ). Any significant change in the exchange rate between US and RMB may materially affect the Company s business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, depending on the weakening or strengthening of RMB against the US . See Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for further discussion. 
 
 Condensed Consolidated Cash Flows 
 
 Our cash flows for the years to date ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 1,252 million in 2024 as compared to 1,334 million in 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by working capital changes. 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 28 million in 2024 as compared to 1,052 million in 2023. The decrease was mainly due to the net impact on cash flows resulting from purchases and maturities of short-term investments, and long-term bank deposits and notes. 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 1,159 million in 2024 as compared to 240 million in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the increase in share repurchases and repayment of short-term bank borrowings. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Historically we have funded our operations through cash generated from the operation of our Company-owned stores and our franchise operations. Our global offering in September 2020 provided us with 2.2 billion in net proceeds. 
 
 Our ability to fund our future operations and capital needs will primarily depend on our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations. We believe our principal uses of cash in the future will be primarily to fund our operations and capital expenditures for accelerating store network expansion and store remodeling, to step up investments in digitalization, automation and logistics infrastructure, to provide returns to our stockholders, as well as to explore opportunities for acquisitions or investments that build and support our ecosystem. We believe that our future cash from operations, together with our funds on hand and access to the capital markets, will provide adequate resources to fund these uses of cash, and that our existing cash, net cash from operations and credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our operations and anticipated capital expenditures for the next 12 months. We currently expect our fiscal year 2024 capital expenditures to be in the range of approximately 700 million to 850 million. 
 
 39 

If our cash flows from operations are less than we require, we may need to access the capital markets to obtain financing. Our access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future or at all will be impacted by many factors, including, but not limited to: 
 
 our financial performance; 

our credit ratings; 

the liquidity of the overall capital markets and our access to capital markets; and 

the state of the Chinese, U.S. and global economies, as well as relations between the Chinese and U.S. governments. 

There can be no assurance that we will have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to us or at all. 
 
 Generally, our income is subject to the Chinese statutory tax rate of 25 . However, to the extent our cash flows from operations exceed our China cash requirements, the excess cash may be subject to an additional 10 withholding tax levied by the Chinese tax authority, subject to any reduction or exemption set forth in relevant tax treaties or tax arrangements. 
 
 Share Repurchases and Dividends 
 
 On November 2, 2023, our Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization to an aggregate of 3.4 billion. During the years to date ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company repurchased 27.3 million shares of common stock for 1,055 million and 4.9 million shares of common stock for 281 million, respectively, under the repurchase program. 
 
 On November 4, 2024, the Board of Directors further increased the Company s share repurchase authorization by 1 billion, bringing total authorization since 2017 to 4.4 billion. With the increase of share repurchase authorization, approximately 1.4 billion remained available for future share repurchases under the authorization. Yum China may repurchase shares under the authorization from time to time in the open market or, subject to applicable regulatory requirements, through privately negotiated transactions, block trades, accelerated share repurchase transactions and the use of Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. 
 
 For the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company paid cash dividends of approximately 61 million and 54 million, respectively, and for the years to date ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company paid aggregate cash dividends of approximately 187 million and 162 million, respectively, to stockholders through a quarterly dividend payment of 0.16 and 0.13 per share, respectively. 
 
 On November 4, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of 0.16 per share, payable on December 17, 2024, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 26, 2024. The total estimated cash dividend payable is approximately 61 million. 
 
 The Company plans to step up the capital returns to shareholders from 3 billion to 4.5 billion between 2024 and 2026, representing an increase of 50 . As part of the enlarged capital returns program, the Company plans to return a total of 1.5 billion in share repurchases and dividends for the full year 2024. 
 
 Our capital returns plan is based on current expectations, which may change based on market conditions, capital needs or otherwise. In addition, our ability to declare and pay any dividends on our stock may be restricted by our earnings available for distribution under applicable Chinese laws. The laws, rules and regulations applicable to our Chinese subsidiaries permit payments of dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with applicable Chinese accounting standards and regulations. Under Chinese laws, an enterprise incorporated in China is required to set aside at least 10 of its after-tax profits each year, after making up previous years accumulated losses, if any, to fund certain statutory reserve funds, until the aggregate amount of such a fund reaches 50 of its registered capital. As a result, our Chinese subsidiaries are restricted in their ability to transfer a portion of their net assets to us in the form of dividends. At the discretion of the board of directors, as an enterprise incorporated in China, each of our Chinese subsidiaries may allocate a portion of its after-tax profits based on Chinese accounting standards to staff welfare and bonus funds. These reserve funds and staff welfare and bonus funds are not distributable as cash dividends. 
 
 Borrowing Capacity 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had credit facilities of RMB8,006 million (approximately 1,141 million), comprised of onshore credit facilities in the aggregate amount of RMB5,900 million (approximately 841 million), offshore credit facilities in the aggregate amount of 100 million and a credit facility of 200 million that can be used for either onshore or offshore. 
 40 

The credit facilities had remaining terms ranging from less than one year to three years as of September 30, 2024. Our credit facilities mainly include term loans, overdrafts, letters of credit, banker s acceptance notes and bank guarantees. The credit facilities in general bear interest based on the Loan Prime Rate LPR published by the National Interbank Funding Centre of the PRC, or Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Each credit facility contains a cross-default provision whereby our failure to make any payment on a principal amount from any credit facility will constitute a default on other credit facilities. Some of the credit facilities contain covenants limiting, among other things, certain additional indebtedness and liens, and certain other transactions specified in the respective agreements. As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding short-term bank borrowings of RMB2,211 million (approximately 315 million), mainly to manage working capital at our operating subsidiaries. Such bank borrowings are due within one year from their issuance dates. As of September 30, 2024, we also had outstanding bank guarantees of RMB244 million (approximately 35 million) mainly to secure our lease payments to landlords for certain Company-owned restaurants. Our credit facilities were therefore reduced by outstanding short-term bank borrowings, adjusted for unamortized interest and collateral, and outstanding guarantees. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had unused credit facilities of approximately 789 million.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 
 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the translation of our reported foreign currency denominated earnings, cash flows and net investments in foreign operations, virtually all of which are denominated in RMB. While substantially all of our supply purchases are denominated in RMB, from time to time, we enter into agreements with third parties to purchase certain amount of goods and services sourced overseas and make payments in the corresponding local currencies at predetermined exchange rates when practical, to minimize the related foreign currency exposure with immaterial impact on our financial statements. 
 
 As substantially all of the Company s operations are located in China, the Company is exposed to movements in the RMB foreign currency exchange rate. For the quarter and year to date ended September 30, 2024, the Company s Operating profit would have decreased by approximately 36 million and 96 million, respectively, if the RMB weakened 10 relative to the U.S. dollar. This estimated reduction assumes no changes in sales volumes or local currency sales or input prices. 
 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 
 We are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk associated with commodity prices. Our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is, at times, limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. We manage our exposure to this risk primarily through pricing agreements with our vendors. 
 
 Investment Risk 
 
 In September 2018, we invested 74 million in 8.4 million of Meituan s ordinary shares. The Company sold 4.2 million of its ordinary shares of Meituan in the second quarter of 2020 for proceeds of approximately 54 million. Equity investment in Meituan is recorded at fair value, which is measured on a recurring basis and is subject to market price volatility. See Note 3 for further discussion on our investment in Meituan. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the evaluation, performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer (the CEO and the Chief Financial Officer (the CFO ), the Company s management, including the CEO and the CFO, concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.
