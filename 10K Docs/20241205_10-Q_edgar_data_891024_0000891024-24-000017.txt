 . We generally sell our customers financing contracts to unaffiliated financial institutions in the normal course of our business. These financing arrangements are accounted for as a sale of assets under the provisions of ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing. We use a monthly unit of account for these financing contracts. 
 We operate under an agreement to sell a portion of our equipment finance contracts to commercial paper conduits with MUFG serving as the agent. We utilize PDC Funding to fulfill a requirement of participating in the commercial paper conduit. We receive the proceeds of the contracts upon sale to MUFG. At least of the proceeds are held by the conduit as security against eventual performance of the portfolio. This percentage can be greater and is based upon certain ratios defined in the agreement with MUFG. The capacity under the agreement with MUFG at October 26, 2024 was . 
 We service the financing contracts for which we are paid a servicing fee. The servicing fees we receive are considered adequate compensation for services rendered. Accordingly, servicing asset or liability has been recorded. 
 The portion of the purchase price for the receivables held by the conduits is deemed a DPP receivable, which is paid to PDC Funding as payments on the customers financing contracts are collected by Patterson from customers. The difference between the carrying amount of the receivables sold under these programs and the sum of the cash and fair value of the DPP receivable received at time of transfer is recognized as a gain or loss on sale of the related receivables and recorded in net sales in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other Comprehensive Income.

 These interest rate cap agreements do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and, accordingly, we record the fair value of the agreements as an asset or liability and the change in fair value as income or expense during the period in which the change occurs. 
 In January 2014, we entered into a forward interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of and accounted for it as a cash flow hedge, in order to hedge interest rate fluctuations in anticipation of refinancing the senior notes due March 25, 2015.

 DPP receivable receivables securitization program We value this DPP receivable based on a discounted cash flow analysis using unobservable inputs, which include the estimated timing of payments and the credit quality of the underlying creditor. Significant changes in any of the significant unobservable inputs in isolation would not result in a materially different fair value estimate. The interrelationship between these inputs is insignificant. 
 DPP receivable - customer financing We value this DPP receivable based on a discounted cash flow analysis using unobservable inputs, which include a forward yield curve, the estimated timing of payments and the credit quality of the underlying creditor. Significant changes in any of the significant unobservable inputs in isolation would not result in a materially different fair value estimate. The interrelationship between these inputs is insignificant. 
 Derivative instruments Our derivative instruments consist of interest rate cap agreements and interest rate swaps. These instruments are valued using inputs such as interest rates and credit spreads. 
 Certain assets are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. These assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis, but are subject to fair value adjustments under certain circumstances. We adjust the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities to fair value when observable transactions of identical or similar securities occur, or due to an impairment. 
 We had an investment in Vetsource, a commercial partner and leading home delivery provider for veterinarians. The investment was valued based on the selling price of the portion of the investment we sold in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The carrying value of the investment was as of April 27, 2024. Concurrent with the sale completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we obtained rights that would allow us, under certain circumstances, to require another shareholder of Vetsource to purchase our remaining shares.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 
 The U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information, so long as those statements are identified as forward-looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those disclosed in the statement. 
 This Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding future financial performance, and the objectives and expectations of management. Forward-looking statements often include words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, intends, plans, seeks or words of similar meaning, or future or conditional verbs, such as will, should, could or may. Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. 
 Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control.

 OVERVIEW 
 Our financial information for the first six months of fiscal 2025 is summarized in this Management s Discussion and Analysis and the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes. The following background is provided to readers to assist in the review of our financial information. 
 We present three reportable segments: Dental, Animal Health and Corporate. Dental and Animal Health are strategic business units that offer similar products and services to different customer bases. Dental provides a virtually complete range of consumable dental products, equipment, turnkey digital solutions and value-added services to dentists and dental laboratories throughout North America. Animal Health is a leading, full-line distributor in North America and the U.K. of animal health products, services and technologies to both the production-animal and companion-pet markets. Our Corporate segment is comprised of general and administrative expenses, including home office support costs in areas such as information technology, finance, legal, human resources and facilities. In addition, customer financing and other miscellaneous sales are reported within Corporate results. 
 Operating margins of the animal health business are lower than the dental business. While operating expenses run at a lower rate in the animal health business when compared to the dental business, gross margins in the animal health business are lower due generally to the low margins experienced on the sale of pharmaceutical products. 
 We operate with a 52-53 week accounting convention with our fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in April. The second quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024 represents the 13 weeks ended October 26, 2024 and October 28, 2023, respectively. Fiscal 2025 will include 52 weeks and fiscal 2024 included 52 weeks. 
 We believe there are several important aspects of our business that are useful in analyzing it, including: (1) growth in the various markets in which we operate; (2) internal growth; (3) growth through acquisition; and (4) continued focus on controlling costs and enhancing efficiency. To measure internal performance, we exclude the impact of foreign currency, contributions from recent acquisitions, and differences in the number of weeks in fiscal periods from net sales. Foreign currency impact represents the difference in results that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates the company uses to convert results for all foreign entities where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. The company calculates the impact as the difference between the current period results translated using the current period currency exchange rates and using the comparable prior period s currency

 exchange rates. The company believes the disclosure of net sales changes in constant currency provides useful supplementary information to investors in light of fluctuations in currency rates. 
 FACTORS AFFECTING OUR RESULTS 
 Restructuring. During the second quarter 2025, we took actions to better align our organization to current market opportunities. These restructuring activities resulted in pre-tax asset impairment charges of 6.9 million to write down assets related to certain software offerings and pre-tax severance charges of 3.3 million. The asset impairment were recorded within cost of sales and the severance was recorded within operating expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other Comprehensive Income. Annual pre-tax savings from the severance actions are estimated to be approximately 16 million, of which approximately 10 million is estimated to be realized in fiscal 2025. 
 Sale of Investment. During the second quarter 2025, we sold our investment in Vetsource, a commercial partner and leading home delivery provider for veterinarians, for 86.4 million. Our investment in VetSource had a carrying value of 56.8 million and a put option with a carrying value of 25.8 million. We recorded a pre-tax gain of 3.8 million in other income, net in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other Comprehensive Income as a result of this sale. The cash received of 86.4 million was reported within investing activities in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
 Change Healthcare cyber attack. Change Healthcare, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group and the largest clearinghouse for medical claims in the U.S., was the subject of a cyberattack in February 2024, which resulted in many dental practices being unable to process insurance claims. Many of our practice management software solutions incorporated a fee-based integration with Change Healthcare for claims management. During the outage, Patterson suspended payment for that service, which impacted the net sales and gross profit of our Dental segment. This outage negatively impacted our business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, continues to affect our business, and has generated litigation. We onboarded a new provider that has a variety of capabilities including, without limitation, insurance claim reimbursement assistance. We have filed a claim with our business interruption insurance provider for losses incurred related to this attack and are actively pursuing reimbursement under our policy coverage. 
 Macro-economic conditions. We are impacted by various conditions that create uncertainty in our macro-economic environment. Cost inflation and fluctuating interest rates may affect our customer's willingness to invest in capital equipment and could impact our customers' volume of purchases. 
 Receivables Securitization Program. We are a party to certain receivables purchase agreements with MUFG Bank, Ltd. ("MUFG"), under which MUFG acts as an agent to facilitate the sale of certain Patterson receivables (the Receivables to certain unaffiliated financial institutions (the Purchasers ). The proceeds from the sale of these Receivables comprise a combination of cash and a deferred purchase price DPP receivable. The DPP receivable is ultimately realized by Patterson following the collection of the underlying Receivables sold to the Purchasers. The collection of the DPP receivable is recognized as an increase to net cash provided by investing activities within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, with a corresponding reduction to net cash used in operating activities within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 QUARTER ENDED OCTOBER 26, 2024 COMPARED TO QUARTER ENDED OCTOBER 28, 2023 
 The following table summarizes our results as a percent of net sales:

Table of Contents 

 Three Months Ended October 26, 2024 October 28, 2023 Net sales 100.0 100.0 Cost of sales 80.4 79.5 Gross profit 19.6 20.5 Operating expenses 17.4 17.1 Operating income 2.2 3.4 Other income (expense) (0.1) (0.2) Income before taxes 2.1 3.2 Income tax expense 0.5 0.8 Net income 1.6 2.4 Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests Net income attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. 1.6 2.4 
 Net Sales . Consolidated net sales for the three months ended October 26, 2024 were 1,674.4 million, an increase of 1.3 from 1,652.8 million for the three months ended October 28, 2023. Foreign exchange rate changes had a favorable impact of 0.5 on current quarter net sales. 
 Dental segment net sales for the three months ended October 26, 2024 were 611.7 million, a decrease of 2.3 from 626.4 million for the three months ended October 28, 2023. Foreign exchange rate changes had no significant impact on current quarter net sales. Current quarter net sales of consumables increased 0.7 , net sales of equipment decreased 7.5 , and net sales of value-added services and other decreased 2.7 . The decrease in net sales of equipment was primarily within digital and CEREC categories. The decrease in net sales of value-added services was primarily due to a decline in sales of software offerings that were negatively impacted by the cybersecurity attack on Change Healthcare. 
 Animal Health segment net sales for the three months ended October 26, 2024 were 1,054.6 million, an increase of 2.9 from 1,024.6 million for the three months ended October 28, 2023. Foreign exchange rate changes had a favorable impact of 0.9 on current quarter net sales. Current quarter net sales of consumables increased 2.6 , net sales of equipment increased 1.4 , and net sales of value-added services and other increased 19.1 . Acquisitions contributed an increase in Animal Health net sales of approximately 0.1 . 
 Gross Profit . The consolidated gross profit margin rate for the three months ended October 26, 2024 decreased 90 basis points to 19.6 . Approximately 40 basis points of the decline was attributable to an asset impairment charge of 6.9 million in our Dental software business. The remainder of the decline was primarily attributable to margin pressure and mix in the Dental segment. The Corporate segment gross profit included the favorable impacts of interest rate changes on our customer financing portfolio in the current quarter. This interest rate impact was partially offset by a loss on associated interest rate swap agreements, which is reflected in other income, net in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other Comprehensive Income. 
 Operating Expenses. Consolidated operating expenses for the three months ended October 26, 2024 were 290.5 million, a 3.0 increase from the prior year quarter of 282.1 million. The consolidated operating expense ratio of 17.4 increased 30 basis points from the prior year quarter. The increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to severance, medical claims, and the write-off of the remaining balance of an inventory pre-payment. The inventory pre-payment was made in a period of supply chain disruptions and determined to be uncollectible in the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. These increases were partially offset by lower travel and entertainment expenses due to discretionary spend management. 
 Operating Income. For the three months ended October 26, 2024, operating income was 37.6 million, or 2.2 of net sales, as compared to 56.9 million, or 3.4 of net sales for the three months ended October 28, 2023. The decrease in operating income was driven primarily by the Dental segment. 
 Dental segment operating income was 33.7 million and 55.3 million for the three months ended October 26, 2024 and October 28, 2023, respectively. The decrease in operating income was primarily attributable to lower net sales and gross profit as compared to the prior year quarter.

Table of Contents 

 Animal Health segment operating income was 29.6 million and 26.3 million for the three months ended October 26, 2024, and October 28, 2023, respectively. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by net sales growth and an increase in gross profit as compared to the prior year quarter. 
 Corporate segment operating loss was 25.6 million and 24.7 million for the three months ended October 26, 2024 and October 28, 2023, respectively. The change was primarily attributable to increases in operating expenses related to severance and medical claims, partially offset by favorable impacts of interest rate changes on our customer financing portfolio in the current year quarter. This interest rate impact was partially offset by changes in the associated interest rate swap agreements, which were reflected in other income, net in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other Comprehensive Income. 
 Other Income (Expense). Net other expense was 2.1 million and 3.5 million for the three months ended October 26, 2024 and October 28, 2023, respectively. We recorded a gain on sale of our investment in VetSource of 3.8 million, and investment income and other increased 2.3 million as compared to the prior year quarter. These favorable impacts were partially offset by an increase in interest expense of 1.2 million and unfavorable impacts of interest rate swaps of 3.5 million as compared to the prior year quarter. 
 
 Income Tax Expense . The effective income tax rate for the three months ended October 26, 2024 was 24.9 , compared to 25.3 for the three months ended October 28, 2023. The change in the rate was primarily due to the benefit of purchased transferable federal tax credits. 
 The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD has published a framework to implement a global minimum income tax rate of 15 through its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Pillar Two project BEPS Pillar Two ). This new legislation became effective in certain countries where the Company operates starting in fiscal 2025. We continue to evaluate the impact of this new legislation. At this time, we do not expect the impact of this legislation to be material to our effective tax rate. 
 Net Income Attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. and Earnings Per Share. Net income attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. for the three months ended October 26, 2024 was 26.8 million, compared to 40.0 million for the three months ended October 28, 2023. Earnings per diluted share were 0.30 in the current quarter compared to 0.42 in the prior year quarter. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the current quarter were 88.7 million, compared to 95.2 million in the prior year quarter. The current quarter and prior year quarter cash dividend declared was 0.26 per common share.

 impact of 0.1 on current period net sales. Current period net sales of consumables decreased 0.8 , net sales of equipment decreased 5.5 , and net sales of value-added services and other decreased 4.7 . The decrease in net sales of equipment was primarily within digital and CEREC categories. The decrease in net sales of value-added services was primarily due to a decline in sales of software offerings that were negatively impacted by the cybersecurity attack on Change Healthcare.

 Gross Profit . The consolidated gross profit margin rate for the six months ended October 26, 2024 decreased 50 basis points from the prior year period to 19.9 . Approximately 20 basis points of the decline was attributable to an asset impairment charge of 6.9 million in our Dental software business. The remainder of the decline was primarily attributable to margin pressure and mix in the Dental segment. The Corporate segment gross profit included the favorable impacts of interest rate changes on our customer financing portfolio in the current quarter. This interest rate impact was partially offset by a loss on associated interest rate swap agreements, which is reflected in other income, net in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other Comprehensive Income. 
 Operating Expenses. Consolidated operating expenses for the six months ended October 26, 2024 were 573.7 million, a 1.9 increase from the prior year period of 563.0 million. The increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to severance, medical claims, and the write-off of the remaining balance of an inventory pre-payment. The inventory pre-payment was made in a period of supply chain disruptions and determined to be uncollectible in the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. These increases were partially offset by lower travel and entertainment expenses due to discretionary spend management. The consolidated operating expense ratio of 17.8 increased 30 basis points from the prior year period, which was also driven by these same factors. 
 Operating Income. For the six months ended October 26, 2024, operating income was 67.0 million, or 2.1 of net sales, as compared to 95.1 million, or 2.9 of net sales for the six months ended October 28, 2023. The decrease in operating income was driven primarily by the Dental segment. 
 Dental segment operating income was 60.7 million for the six months ended October 26, 2024, a decrease of 33.2 million from the prior year period. The decrease was primarily driven by decreases in net sales and gross profit. 
 Animal Health segment operating income was 55.0 million for the six months ended October 26, 2024, a decrease of 1.1 million from the prior year period. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in net sales and gross profit, partially offset by lower operating expenses due to discretionary spend management during the six months ended October 26, 2024. 
 Corporate segment operating loss was 48.7 million and 54.9 million for the six months ended October 26, 2024 and October 28, 2023, respectively. The change was primarily attributable to increases in our equipment financing sales, including favorable impacts of interest rate changes on our customer financing portfolio, in the current year period as compared to the prior year period. This interest rate impact was partially offset by changes in the associated interest rate swap agreements, which were reflected in other income, net in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other Comprehensive Income. The favorability in net sales was partially offset by increases in operating expenses. 
 Other Income (Expense). Net other expense was 13.6 million and 1.2 million for the six months ended October 26, 2024 and October 28, 2023, respectively. The change was driven by an increase in interest expense of 4.9 million and unfavorable impacts of interest rate swaps of 14.0 million as compared to the prior year period. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by a gain on sale of our investment in VetSource of 3.8 million, and an increase to investment income and other of 2.7 million as compared to the prior year period. 
 Income Tax Expense . The effective income tax rate for the six months ended October 26, 2024 and October 28, 2023 was 24.5 . The rate was impacted by a favorable income tax reserve adjustment offset by excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation. 
 Net Income Attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. and Earnings Per Share. Net income attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. for the six months ended October 26, 2024 was 40.5 million, compared to 71.2 million for the six months ended October 28, 2023.

 to 0.74 in the prior year period. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the current period were 88.7 million, compared to 95.7 million in the prior year period. The current period and prior year period cash dividend declared was 0.52 per common share. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 458.7 million and 485.3 million for the six months ended October 26, 2024 and October 28, 2023, respectively. Net cash used in operating activities for the six months ended October 26, 2024 was primarily driven by the impact of our Receivables Securitization Program and a decrease to net income as compared to the prior year period, partially offset by a lower investment in working capital. 
 Net cash provided by investing activities was 549.3 million and 454.9 million for the six months ended October 26, 2024 and October 28, 2023, respectively. Collections of DPP receivables were 497.0 million and 489.5 million for the six months ended October 26, 2024 and October 28, 2023, respectively. During the six months ended October 26, 2024, we recorded cash receipts of 86.4 million from the sale of our investment in VetSource and used 7.9 million to acquire Infusion Concepts Limited and Mountain Vet Supply. Capital expenditures were 26.2 million and 33.5 million during the six months ended October 26, 2024 and October 28, 2023, respectively. We expect to use a total of approximately 60.0 million for capital expenditures in fiscal 2025. 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the six months ended October 26, 2024 was 48.9 million, driven by 50.0 million for share repurchases and 46.2 million for dividend payments, partially offset by 48.0 million attributed to draws on our revolving line of credit. Cash received from the sale of VetSource was used to reduce the draw on our revolving line of credit. Net cash used in financing activities for the six months ended October 28, 2023 was 13.2 million, driven primarily by dividend payments of 50.3 million and share repurchases of 90.5 million, partially offset by 125.0 million attributed to draws on our revolving line of credit. 
 In fiscal 2021, we entered into an amendment, restatement and consolidation of certain credit agreements with various lenders, including MUFG Bank, Ltd, as administrative agent. This amended and restated credit agreement (the Credit Agreement consisted of a 700.0 million revolving credit facility and a 300.0 million term loan facility, and was set to mature no later than February 2024. 
 In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we amended and restated the Credit Agreement (the Amended Credit Agreement ). The Amended Credit Agreement consists of a 700.0 million revolving credit facility and a 300.0 million term loan facility, and will mature no later than October 2027. We used the Amended Credit Agreement facilities to refinance and consolidate the Credit Agreement, and pay the fees and expenses incurred therewith. We expect to use the Amended Credit Agreement to finance our ongoing working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes. 
 As of October 26, 2024, 294.0 million was outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement term loan at an interest rate of 5.96 , and 234.0 million was outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement revolving credit facility at an interest rate of 6.02 . As of April 27, 2024, 295.5 million was outstanding under the Credit Agreement term loan at an interest rate of 6.54 , and 186.0 million was outstanding under the Credit Agreement revolving credit facility at an interest rate of 6.53 . 
 We expect the collection of deferred purchase price receivables, existing cash balances and credit availability under existing debt facilities, less our funds used in operations, will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and to finance our business over the remainder of fiscal 2025.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 From time to time, we become involved in lawsuits, administrative proceedings, government subpoenas, and government investigations (which may, in some cases, involve our entering into settlement agreements or consent decrees), relating to antitrust, commercial, environmental, product liability, intellectual property, regulatory, employment discrimination, securities, and other matters, including matters arising out of the ordinary course of business. The results of any such proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty because such matters are inherently uncertain. Significant damages or penalties may be sought in some matters, and some matters may require years to resolve. We also may be subject to fines or penalties, and equitable remedies (including but not limited to the suspension, revocation or non-renewal of licenses). We accrue for these matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Adverse outcomes may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. There also exists the possibility of a material adverse effect on our financial statements for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable. 
 See Note 11 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 27, 2024. 
 
 ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer 
 On March 11, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized a 500 million share repurchase program through March 16, 2027. As of October 26, 2024 there was 450.0 million remaining under the stock repurchase program. 
 No shares were repurchased under the stock repurchase program during the second quarter of fiscal 2025. 
 Our Credit Agreement permits us to declare and pay dividends, and repurchase shares, provided that no default or unmatured default exists and that we are in compliance with applicable financial covenants. 
 
 ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION 
 Insider Trading Arrangements 
 A significant portion of the compensation of our executive officers is delivered in the form of equity awards, including restricted stock units, performance units and non-qualified stock options. All of these awards contain vesting requirements related to service, with performance units also requiring satisfaction of certain performance criteria to obtain a payout. This compensation design is intended to align executive compensation with the performance experienced by our shareholders. Following delivery of shares of our common stock under such equity awards, once any applicable service- or performance-based vesting standards have been satisfied, our executive officers from time to time engage in the open-market sale of some of those shares for diversification or other personal reasons. Our executive officers may also engage from time to time in other transactions involving our securities. 
 Transactions in our securities by our directors and officers are required to be made in accordance with our Securities Trading and Information Disclosure Policy (our Insider Trading Policy ), which, among other things, requires that the transactions be in accordance with applicable U.S. federal securities laws that prohibit trading while in possession of material nonpublic information. Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act provides an affirmative defense that enables directors and officers to prearrange transactions in the company s securities in a manner that avoids concerns about initiating transactions while in possession of material nonpublic information. Our Insider Trading Policy permits our directors and officers to enter into trading plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1. 
 In addition, our directors and officers are required to maintain an ownership of the company s common stock with a value equal to at least a multiple of their annual base salary (5x annual salary for our Chief Executive Officer and 3x 
 28
