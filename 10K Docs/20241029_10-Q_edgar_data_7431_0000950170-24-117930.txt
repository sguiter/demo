BOK In July 2023, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding stock of BOK for a purchase price of million and additional contingent consideration payable upon the achievement of certain future performance obligations in 2024 and 2025 not to exceed million. We, with the assistance of an independent, third-party valuation specialist, utilized a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration of million at the acquisition date, resulting in a purchase price of million. The total fair value of tangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed was million. The total fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired was million, resulting in million of goodwill. Acquired intangible assets were comprised of amortizable patents of million, amortizable trademarks of million, amortizable customer relationships of million, and non-compete agreements of million, that are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average life of , , , and years, respectively.

Effective tax rate 

The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was essentially unchanged from the same period in 2023. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2024 in comparison to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to an increase in discrete tax benefits recognized, partially offset by less favorable permanent adjustments. It is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months. However, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible outcomes cannot be reliably made at this time. Changes to unrecognized tax benefits could result from the expiration of statutes of limitations, the completion of ongoing examinations, or other unforeseen circumstances.

We also have a million bi-lateral letter of credit facility. We utilize lines of credit and other commercial commitments to ensure that adequate funds are available to meet operating requirements. Letters of credit are currently arranged through our revolving credit facility and our bi-lateral facility. Letters of credit may be issued to third party suppliers, insurance companies and financial institutions and typically can only be drawn upon in the event of AWI s failure to pay its obligations to the beneficiary.

Excluded from the table above is the net periodic pension cost associated with an unfunded defined benefit pension plan in Germany that was not included as part of prior dispositions. This plan is reported as a component of our Unallocated Corporate segment. Net periodic pension cost for this plan was immaterial for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The service cost component of net benefit cost has been presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income within cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative SG A expenses for all periods presented, which are the same line items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. The other components of net benefit cost are presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income separately from the service cost component within other non-operating income, net.

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, customer receivables and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. The fair value estimates of long-term debt are based on data for our Term Loan A debt provided by a major financial institution. The fair value estimates for interest rate swap contracts are estimated with the assistance of third-party valuation experts and verified by obtaining quotes from major financial institutions. We engaged an independent, third-party valuation specialist to determine the fair value estimate for acquisition-related contingent consideration payable based on performance, which was measured using a Monte Carlo simulation. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, acquisition-related contingent consideration liabilities represented additional cash consideration payable related to our acquisitions of Insolcorp and BOK that will be paid upon the final achievement of certain financial and performance milestones. As of September 30, 2024 , million of acquisition-related contingent consideration was classified as accounts payable and other accrued expenses, while million was classified as other long-term liabilities on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of December 31, 2023, million was classified as other long-term liabilities on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.

million with certain legacy insurance carriers to resolve ongoing litigation and recover fees and costs previously incurred by us in connection with certain environmental sites. These settlements were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold and SG A expenses, reflecting the same income statement categories where environmental expenditures were historically recorded. From 2020 through the third quarter of 2024, cumulative insurance recoveries exceeded cumulative expenses to date related to the respective environmental sites and the excess was recorded within long-term liabilities on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Excess recoveries are released to offset additional reserves for potential liabilities incurred on the respective environmental sites. As of December 31, 2023, insurance recoveries in excess of cumulative expenses were million. We may enter into additional settlement agreements in the future, which may or may not be material, with other legacy insurers to obtain reimbursement or contribution for environmental site expenses. Estimates of our future liability at the environmental sites are based on evaluations of currently available facts regarding each individual site. We consider factors such as our activities associated with the site, existing technology, presently enacted laws and 

 21

 landfills located on a portion of our facility in Macon, Georgia, along with the former Macon Naval Ordnance Plant landfill adjacent to our property, portions of Rocky Creek, and certain tributaries leading to Rocky Creek (collectively, the Macon Site as a Superfund site on the National Priorities List due to the presence of contaminants, most notably polychlorinated biphenyls PCBs ). In September 2010, we entered into an Administrative Order on Consent for a Removal Action (the Removal Action with the EPA to investigate PCB contamination in of the landfills on our property, the Wastewater Treatment Plant Landfill Operable Unit 1 ). After completing an investigation of Operable Unit 1 and submitting our final Engineering Evaluation/Cost Analysis, the EPA issued an Action Memorandum in July 2013 selecting our recommended remedy for the Removal Action. The Operable Unit 1 response action is complete and the final report was submitted to the EPA in October 2016 . The EPA approved the final report in November 2016, and a Post-Removal Control Plan was submitted to the EPA in March 2017. AWI has been conducting operation and maintenance activities of the completed remedy since 2017 consistent with the approved Post-Removal Control Plan. In September 2015, AWI and other Potential Responsible Parties PRPs received a Special Notice Letter from the EPA under CERCLA inviting AWI and the PRPs to enter into the negotiation of a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study RI/FS with respect to the remainder of the Superfund site, which included the other landfill on our property, as well as areas on and adjacent to our property and Rocky Creek Operable Unit 2 ). We and the other PRPs entered into a settlement agreement with the EPA effective September 2018, in response to the Special Notice Letter to conduct the RI/FS. The PRPs submitted an RI/FS work plan, which was approved by the EPA in September 2019. Investigative work on this portion of the site commenced in December 2019. In June 2021, the PRPs submitted a Site Characterization Summary Report SCSR for Operable Unit 2 to the EPA. The purpose of the SCSR was to demonstrate that the available data for Operable Unit 2 was adequate for the risk assessment and for the development of remedial action objectives. In the second half of 2022, the EPA and the PRPs agreed to separate all non-groundwater aspects of the site; the groundwater investigation is ongoing. In August 2022, the PRPs submitted a Human Health Baseline Risk Assessment to the EPA, and in December 2022, the PRPs submitted a final Baseline Ecological Risk Assessment for all non-groundwater aspects of Operable Unit 2 to the EPA. Both risk assessments served as exhibits to the Remedial Investigation Report RIR ), which the EPA approved in July 2023. Based on findings in the RIR, the PRPs developed a draft Feasibility Study FS to identify and evaluate potential remedial alternatives for all non-groundwater elements of Operable Unit 2. The draft FS was submitted to the EPA in August 2023. The EPA and the State of Georgia provided comments in October 2023 and a revised FS was submitted in November 2023. The EPA conditionally approved the FS in April 2024 and issued a Proposed Remedial Action Plan Proposed Plan for the non-groundwater elements at the site in May 2024. The EPA held a public meeting in May 2024 to explain the Proposed Plan and start the thirty-day period for public comment, which closed on June 30, 2024. The EPA s Proposed Plan included a total cost estimate for the non-groundwater elements at the site of approximately million. In August 2024, the EPA signed the Record of Decision, selecting the remedy outlined in the Proposed Plan. The portion of these remediation costs that AWI will bear for all non-groundwater elements of Operable Unit 2 will not be known until the PRPs resolve the final allocation of costs. It is probable that we will incur field investigation, engineering and oversight costs associated with designing and implementing the remedy for all non-groundwater elements of Operable Unit 2 and for completing an RI/FS for all groundwater elements of Operable Unit 2 (now designated Operable Unit 3 by the EPA). We may also ultimately incur costs in remediating contamination discovered during the RI/FS for Operable Unit 3 and we are unable to reasonably estimate our final share of the total costs associated with the investigation work or any resulting remediation therefrom, although such amounts may be material to any one quarter's or year's results of operations in the future. We do not expect the total future costs to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity or financial condition as the cash payments may be made over many years. Elizabeth City, North Carolina This site is a former cabinet manufacturing facility that from 1977 until 1996 was operated by Triangle Pacific Corporation, which became Armstrong Wood Products, Inc. AWP ), and is now known as AHF Products, LLC. The site was formerly owned by the U.S. Navy Navy and Westinghouse, which was purchased by Paramount Global Paramount (then known as CBS Corporation). We assumed ownership of the site when we acquired the stock of AWP in 1998. Prior to our acquisition, the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources listed the site as a hazardous waste site. In 1997, AWP entered into a cost sharing

 million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. As noted above, expenses associated with additional reserves for environmental matters were offset through the release of a portion of the balance of insurance recoveries in excess of cumulative expenses. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded million and million of additional reserves for potential environmental liabilities, of which, million was offset through a release of our remaining environmental insurance recoveries in excess of cumulative expenses, and million was recorded as a component of SG A expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded million of additional reserves for potential environmental liabilities, all of which was offset through a release of our remaining environmental insurance recoveries in excess of cumulative expenses. Where existing data is sufficient to estimate the liability, that estimate has been used; where only a range of probable liabilities is available and no amount within that range is more likely than any other, the lower end of the range has been used. As assessments and remediation activities progress at each site, these liabilities are reviewed to reflect new information as it becomes available and adjusted to reflect amounts actually incurred and paid. These liabilities are undiscounted. The estimated environmental liabilities above do not take into account any claims for additional recoveries from insurance or third parties. It is our policy to record insurance recoveries as assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets when realizable. We incur costs to pursue environmental insurance recoveries, which are expensed as incurred. Actual costs to be incurred at identified sites may vary from our estimates. Based on our knowledge of the identified sites, it is not possible to reasonably estimate future costs in excess of amounts already recognized. OTHER CLAIMS From time to time, we are involved in other various lawsuits, claims, investigations and other legal matters that arise in the ordinary course of business, including matters involving our products, intellectual property, relationships with suppliers, relationships with distributors, other customers or end users, relationships with competitors, employees and other matters. In connection with those matters, we may have rights of indemnity, contribution or reimbursement from other parties or coverage under applicable insurance policies. When applicable and appropriate, we will seek indemnity, contribution or reimbursement from other parties and pursue coverage and recoveries under those policies, but are unable to predict the outcome of those demands.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS O F FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 This discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements, the accompanying notes, the cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements and risk factors included in this report and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 OVERVIEW 
 AWI is a leader in the design, innovation and manufacture of ceiling and wall solutions in the Americas. We manufacture and source products made of numerous materials, including mineral fiber, fiberglass wool, metal, wood, felt, wood fiber, architectural resin and glass, and glass-reinforced-gypsum. We also manufacture ceiling suspension system (grid) products through a joint venture with Worthington Enterprises, Inc. Worthington called Worthington Armstrong Venture WAVE ). 
 Acquisitions and Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates 
 In April 2024, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interests in 3form, LLC 3form ), a subsidiary of Hunter Douglas, Inc. based in Salt Lake City, Utah. 3form is a designer and manufacturer of architectural resin and glass products used for specialty walls, partitions and ceilings. The operations, assets and liabilities of 3form are included in our Architectural Specialties segment. 
 In January 2024, we entered into a strategic partnership and equity investment in Overcast Innovations LLC Overcast with McKinstry Essention, LLC whereby we acquired a 19.5 ownership interest in Overcast, with future rights to increase our ownership interest. Overcast is a solutions company offering prefabricated ceiling cloud systems, modular grid platforms and engineering design services to reduce waste and inefficiencies in the built environment. Our investment and equity earnings in Overcast are included in our Unallocated Corporate segment. 
 In October 2023, we acquired a portion of the business and certain assets of Insolcorp, LLC Insolcorp ), based in Albemarle, North Carolina, used to develop, test and manufacture energy saving products deployed in building and roofing installations. The acquired operations, assets and liabilities of Insolcorp are included in our Mineral Fiber segment. 
 In July 2023, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding stock of BOK Modern, LLC BOK ), based in San Rafael, California. BOK is a designer of metal facade architectural solutions. The acquired operations, assets and liabilities of BOK are included in our Architectural Specialties segment. 
 Manufacturing Plants 
 As of September 30, 2024, we operated 19 manufacturing plants, including 17 plants located within the U.S. and two plants in Canada. 
 WAVE operates seven additional plants in the U.S. to produce suspension system (grid) products, which we use and sell in our ceiling systems. 
 Reportable Segments 
 Our operating segments are as follows: Mineral Fiber, Architectural Specialties and Unallocated Corporate. 
 Mineral Fiber produces suspended mineral fiber and soft fiber ceiling systems. Our mineral fiber products offer various performance attributes such as acoustical control, rated fire protection, and energy efficiency, along with other health and sustainability features and aesthetic appeal. Ceiling products are primarily sold to resale distributors, ceiling systems contractors and wholesalers, and retailers (including large home centers). The Mineral Fiber segment also includes the results of WAVE, which manufactures and sells suspension system (grid) products and ceiling component products that are invoiced by both AWI and WAVE. Segment results relating to WAVE consist primarily of equity earnings and reflect our 50 equity interest in the joint venture. Ceiling component products consist of ceiling perimeters and trim, in addition to grid products that support drywall ceiling systems. For some customers, WAVE sells its suspension system products to AWI for resale to customers. Mineral Fiber segment results reflect those sales transactions. The Mineral Fiber segment also includes all assets and liabilities not specifically allocated to our Architectural Specialties or Unallocated Corporate segment, including all property and related depreciation associated with our Lancaster, Pennsylvania headquarters. Operating results for the Mineral Fiber segment include a significant majority of allocated Corporate administrative expenses that represent a reasonable allocation of general services to support its operations. 
 Architectural Specialties produces, designs and sources ceilings, walls and facades primarily for use in commercial settings. Products are available in numerous materials, such as metal, wood and felt, in addition to various colors, shapes and designs. These 
 25 

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

 products offer various performance attributes such as acoustical control, rated fire protection, light and aesthetic appeal. We sell standard, premium and customized products, a portion of which are sourced from third-party producers. Architectural Specialties products are sold primarily to resale distributors and direct customers, primarily ceiling systems contractors. The majority of this segment s revenues are project driven, which can lead to more variability in sales patterns. Operating results for the Architectural Specialties segment include a portion of allocated Corporate administrative expenses that represent a reasonable allocation of general services to support its operations. 
 Unallocated Corporate includes certain assets, liabilities, income and expenses that have not been allocated to our other business segments and consists of: cash and cash equivalents, our Overcast investment and related equity earnings/losses, the net funded status of our U.S. Retirement Income Plan RIP ), the estimated fair value of interest rate swap contracts, outstanding borrowings under our senior secured credit facility and income tax balances. 
 Factors Affecting Revenues 
 For information on our 2024 net sales by segment, see Notes 2 and 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Markets. We compete in the building product markets of the Americas. We closely monitor publicly available macroeconomic data and trends that provide insight into commercial construction market activity, including, but not limited to, gross domestic product, office vacancy rates, the Architecture Billings Index, new commercial construction starts, state and local government spending, corporate profits, and retail sales. The Company also continues to monitor the impacts of geopolitical events, none of which had a material direct impact on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations in the first nine months of 2024 or 2023. 
 Several factors and trends within our markets affected our business performance during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023, most notably an increase in net sales due to our April 2024 acquisition of 3form and our July 2023 acquisition of BOK. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, sales volumes increased 30 million compared to the same period in 2023, with the 3form and BOK acquisitions contributing 25 million to net sales. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, sales volumes increased 53 million compared to the same period in 2023 driven primarily by a 48 million increase in net sales from the 3form and BOK acquisitions. 
 Average Unit Value . We periodically modify sales prices of our products due to changes in costs for raw materials and energy, market conditions and the competitive environment. Typically, realized price increases are less than announced price increases because of project pricing, competitive adjustments and changing market conditions. We also offer a wide assortment of products that are differentiated by style, design and performance attributes. Pricing and margins for products within the assortment vary. In addition, changes in the relative quantity of products purchased at different price points can impact year-to-year comparisons of net sales and operating income. Within our Mineral Fiber segment, we focus on improving sales dollars per unit sold, or average unit value AUV ), as a measure that accounts for the varying assortment of products and like-for-like pricing impacting our revenues. 
 Favorable AUV increased our total consolidated net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 by approximately 9 million and 42 million, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. Our Architectural Specialties segment revenues are primarily generated by individual contracts that include a mix of products, both manufactured by us and sourced from third parties, that varies by project. As such, we do not track AUV performance for this segment, but rather attribute most changes in net sales to volume. 
 During the first and third quarters of 2024, we implemented price increases on Mineral Fiber ceiling products. During the first and second quarters of 2024, WAVE implemented price increases on grid products. Future pricing actions may be implemented based on numerous factors, including the rate and pace of inflation and its impact on our business. 
 Seasonality . Historically, our sales tend to be stronger in the second and third quarters of our fiscal year due to more favorable weather conditions, customer business cycles and the timing of renovation and new construction projects. 
 Factors Affecting Operating Costs 
 Operating Expenses. Our operating expenses are composed of direct production costs (principally raw materials, labor, and energy), manufacturing overhead costs, freight, costs to purchase sourced products and selling, general and administrative SG A expenses. 
 26 

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

 Our largest raw material expenditures are primarily for fiberglass, perlite, recycled paper, and starch. Other raw materials include clay, felt, pigment, wood, and wood fiber. We manufacture substantially all of our mineral wool at one of our manufacturing facilities. We use aluminum and steel in the production of metal ceilings by us and by WAVE. Finally, natural gas and packaging materials are also significant input costs. Fluctuations in the prices of these inputs impact our financial results. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, lower energy and freight costs were partially offset by higher raw material costs, resulting in a 1 million and 5 million benefit to operating income, respectively, compared to the prior year periods. 
 Acquisition-Related Expenses and Losses 
 In connection with our acquisitions of 3form in April 2024, Insolcorp in October 2023, BOK in July 2023 and Arktura LLC Arktura in December 2020, we recorded certain acquisition-related expenses and losses to operating income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, summarized as follows (dollar amounts in millions):

The inventory amounts above reflect the post-acquisition expenses associated with recording inventory at fair value as part of purchase accounting for the 3form acquisition. Expenses related to the deferred cash and restricted stock awards were related to our Arktura acquisition and represented expenses for Arktura s former owners and employees that were recorded over their respective service periods, as such payments were subject to the awardees continued employment with AWI. The Company and the former owners of Arktura mutually agreed upon the separation of their service effective in the fourth quarter of 2023. Acquisition costs above reflect certain contingent third-party professional fees incurred due to the 3form acquisition. The change in fair value of contingent consideration was related to our BOK and Insolcorp acquisitions and is remeasured quarterly during each acquisition's earn-out periods. See Note 15 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Depreciation of fixed assets acquired and amortization of intangible assets acquired have been excluded from the table above. 
 Employees 
 As of September 30, 2024 we had approximately 3,500 full-time and part-time employees, compared to 3,100 full-time and part-time employees as of December 31, 2023. The increase in employees since December 31, 2023 was primarily driven by our April 2024 acquisition of 3form.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Consolidated net sales for the third quarter of 2024 increased 11.3 over the prior-year period primarily due to higher volumes of 30 million and favorable AUV of 9 million. Architectural Specialties net sales increased 31 million and Mineral Fiber net sales increased 8 million over the prior-year period. Architectural Specialties segment net sales improved primarily due to contributions from the acquisitions of 3form and BOK. The increase in Mineral Fiber net sales was primarily driven by favorable AUV. 
 Consolidated net sales for the first nine months of 2024 increased 9.7 compared to the prior-year period primarily due to higher volumes of 53 million and favorable AUV of 42 million. Architectural Specialties net sales increased 59 million and Mineral Fiber net sales increased 36 million over the prior-year period. Architectural Specialties segment net sales improved primarily due to contributions from the acquisitions of 3form and BOK. The increase in Mineral Fiber net sales was primarily driven by favorable AUV, partially offset by lower sales volumes. 
 Cost of goods sold in the third quarter of 2024 was 57.6 of net sales, compared to 59.3 for the same period in 2023. Cost of goods sold in the first nine months of 2024 was 59.4 of sales, compared to 61.6 for the same period in 2023. The decreases in cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 were driven primarily by favorable AUV margin benefit, improved manufacturing productivity and lower input costs. 
 SG A expenses in the third quarter of 2024 were 77.6 million, or 20.1 of net sales, compared to 64.6 million, or 18.6 of net sales, for the same period in 2023. The year-over-year increase in SG A expenses was primarily driven by an 11 million increase related to the acquisitions of 3form and BOK and a 3 million increase in incentive compensation. 
 SG A expenses in the first nine months of 2024 were 223.1 million, or 20.7 of net sales, compared to 189.2 million, or 19.2 of net sales, for the same period in 2023. The year-over-year increase in SG A expenses was primarily driven by a 20 million increase related to the acquisitions of 3form and BOK, a 6 million increase in incentive compensation, a 3 million increase in deferred compensation related charges, a 2 million increase in selling expenses, as well as a 2 million increase in business development expenses. 
 Remeasurement losses for changes in the fair value of contingent consideration were 0.2 million and 0.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and related to our BOK and Insolcorp acquisitions. See Note 15 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 
 Impairment and gain on sales of fixed assets, net were 0.2 million and 0.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the third quarter of 2024, we recorded a 4.6 million gain on the sale of our idled Mineral Fiber plant in St. Helens, Oregon. Also in the third quarter of 2024, we recorded a 4.9 million impairment charge for undeveloped land adjacent to our Corporate headquarters, which represented the expected loss on sale of the property based on an agreement we entered into with a buyer that we anticipate closing within the next twelve months. 
 Equity earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries were 25.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 23.4 million in the third quarter of 2023, and were 78.7 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 69.1 million in the same period in 2023. WAVE equity earnings were 25.5 million in the third quarter of 2024, while Overcast equity losses were 0.3 million. WAVE equity earnings were 79.4 million in the first nine months of 2024, while Overcast equity losses were 0.7 million. The year-over-year increase in WAVE equity earnings for the third quarter of 2024 was primarily driven by the benefit from favorable AUV, partially offset by lower sales volumes. The year-over-year increase in WAVE equity earnings for the first nine months of 2024 was primarily driven by the benefit from favorable AUV and higher sales volumes, partially offset by increased employee compensation and benefits. See Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 
 Interest expense was 10.5 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 8.8 million in the third quarter of 2023. Interest expense was 30.6 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 26.7 million in the first nine months of 2023. The increases for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 in comparison to the same periods in 2023 were primarily due to higher average effective interest rates, partially offset by lower average debt balances. 
 Other non-operating income, net, was 3.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2.3 million in the third quarter of 2023. Other non-operating income, net, was 9.3 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 6.9 million in the first nine months of 2023. The increases in other non-operating income, net, for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 in comparison to the same periods in 2023 were primarily driven by the non-service cost components of pension and postretirement net periodic benefit costs. 
 Income tax expense was 26.9 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 24.2 million in the third quarter of 2023. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was 25.9 compared to 25.8 for the same period of 2023. Income tax expense was 68.4 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 60.6 million in the first nine months of 2023. The effective tax rate was 25.2 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 25.5 in the same period of 2023. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was essentially unchanged from the same period in 2023. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2024 in comparison to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to an increase in discrete tax benefits recognized, partially offset by less favorable permanent adjustments.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

 Total Other Comprehensive Loss OCL was 6.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2.6 million in the third quarter of 2023. OCL was 8.2 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 4.3 million in the first nine months of 2023. The change in OCL in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 were primarily driven by derivative losses, pension and postretirement adjustments and foreign currency translation adjustments. Derivative losses represent the mark-to-market value fair adjustments for our derivative assets and liabilities, and the recognition of gains and losses previously deferred in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. Pension and postretirement adjustments represent the amortization of actuarial gains and losses related to our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans. Foreign currency translation adjustments represent the change in the U.S. dollar value of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Foreign currency translation adjustments in 2024 and 2023 were driven primarily by changes in the Canadian dollar.

Net sales increased 3.3 in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the prior-year quarter due to 10 million of favorable AUV, partially offset by 1 million of lower sales volumes. The improvement in AUV was driven by favorable like-for-like price. 
 For the first nine months of 2024, net sales improved by 5.0 from the prior-year period, primarily due to 42 million of favorable AUV, partially offset by lower sales volumes of 6 million. The favorable AUV was driven primarily by positive like-for-like pricing, and to a lesser extent, favorable mix. The decrease in volumes for the first nine months of 2024 was driven primarily within our home center customer channel, most notably prior-year first quarter inventory level increases that did not repeat in the current year period, partially offset by the positive contribution from our growth initiatives compared to the prior-year period. 
 Third-quarter 2024 operating income increased primarily due to a 6 million benefit from favorable AUV, a 3 million decrease in manufacturing and input costs and a 2 million increase in WAVE equity earnings. These benefits were partially offset by a 3 million increase in SG A expenses, primarily driven by higher incentive compensation. 
 Operating income for the first nine months of 2024 increased primarily due to a 28 million benefit from favorable AUV, a 10 million increase in WAVE equity earnings and a 9 million decrease in manufacturing and input costs, partially offset by a 4 million decrease from lower sales volumes. Operating income was also negatively impacted by a 15 million increase in SG A expenses, which was primarily due to increases in incentive compensation, an increase in deferred compensation related charges, an increase in employee costs due to inflationary pressures, higher depreciation and amortization expense and an increase in accruals for environmental remediation matters.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

 Operating income increased in the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to an 18 million margin benefit from increased sales, driven primarily by the acquisitions of 3form and BOK, and partially due to improved custom project margins. This increase was partially offset by a 10 million increase in SG A expenses and a 3 million increase in manufacturing costs, both of which were primarily due to the acquisitions of 3form and BOK. 
 Operating income for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was positively impacted by a 36 million margin benefit from increased sales, driven primarily by the acquisitions of 3form and BOK, and partially due to improved custom project margins. This increase was largely offset by a 20 million increase in SG A expenses primarily due to the acquisitions of 3form and BOK and a 9 million increase in manufacturing costs, driven by inflationary pressures and the acquisitions of 3form and BOK. 
 Unallocated Corporate 
 Unallocated Corporate operating loss was 1 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023. Unallocated Corporate operating loss was 3 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2 million in the first nine months of 2023. 
 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY 
 Cash Flow 
 Operating activities for the first nine months of 2024 provided 180.2 million, compared to 176.4 million for the first nine months of 2023. The favorable change in cash from operating activities was driven by higher cash earnings for the first nine months of 2024 in comparison to the prior-year period and a favorable timing-related change in accounts payable and accrued expenses was partially offset by an unfavorable timing-related change in accounts receivables and an increase in cash paid for income taxes. 
 Net cash used for investing activities was 61.2 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 10.6 million in the first nine months of 2023. The unfavorable change in cash in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to 94 million of cash paid for the 3form acquisition, partially offset by proceeds received from the sale of fixed assets, an increase in proceeds received from company-owned life insurance policies, and lower purchases of property, plant and equipment. 
 Net cash used for financing activities was 115.7 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 175.1 million cash in the first nine months of 2023. The favorable change in cash was primarily due to a decrease in repurchases of outstanding common stock and lower payments of acquisition-related contingent consideration. 
 Liquidity 
 Our liquidity needs for operations vary throughout the year. We retain lines of credit to facilitate our seasonal cash flow needs, since cash flow is historically lower during the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. 
 We have a 950.0 million variable rate senior credit facility, which is comprised of a 500.0 million revolving credit facility (with a 150.0 million sublimit for letters of credit) and a 450.0 million Term Loan A. The revolving credit facility and Term Loan A are currently priced at 1.375 over the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ), plus a 10-basis point adjustment. The revolving credit facility and Term Loan A mature in December 2027. We also have a 25.0 million bi-lateral letter of credit facility. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the total principal balances outstanding under our senior credit facility were 433.1 million under Term Loan A and 125.0 million under the revolving credit facility. 
 The senior credit facility includes two financial covenants that require the ratio of consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA to consolidated cash interest expense minus cash consolidated interest income to be greater than or equal to 3.0 to 1.0, and requires the ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness, minus AWI and domestic subsidiary unrestricted cash and cash equivalents up to 100 million, to EBITDA to be less than or equal to 3.75 to 1.0 (subject to certain exceptions for certain acquisitions). As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants of the senior credit facility.

Under the terms of the interest rate swap with a November 28, 2018 trade date above, we pay a fixed rate monthly and receive a floating rate based on SOFR, inclusive of a 0 floor. Under the terms of all remaining interest rate swaps above, we pay a fixed rate monthly and receive a floating rate based on SOFR. 
 As of September 30, 2024, these swaps are designated as cash flow hedges against changes in SOFR for a portion of our variable rate debt. 
 We utilize lines of credit and other commercial commitments to ensure that adequate funds are available to meet operating requirements. Letters of credit are currently arranged through our revolving credit facility and our bi-lateral facility. Letters of credit may be issued to third party suppliers, insurance companies and financial institutions and typically can only be drawn upon in the event of AWI s failure to pay its obligations to the beneficiary. The following table presents details related to our letters of credit facilities (dollar amounts in millions):

As of September 30, 2024, we also had 375 million available under our revolving credit facility. We believe cash on hand and cash generated from operations, together with borrowing capacity under our credit facility, will be adequate to address our near-term liquidity needs based on current expectations of our business operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions and scheduled payments of debt obligations.

On July 29, 2016, our Board of Directors approved our share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to 150.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock (the Program ). Since inception of the Program, we have been further authorized to repurchase up to an aggregate of 1,700.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock through December 31, 2026. 
 Repurchases of our common stock under the Program may be made through open market, block and privately negotiated transactions, including Rule 10b5-1 plans, at such times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate, subject to market and business conditions, regulatory requirements and other factors.

 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 0.1 million shares under the Program for a total cost of 15.0 million, excluding commissions and taxes, or an average price of 119.05 per share. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 0.4 million shares under the Program for a total cost of 40.0 million, excluding commissions and taxes, or an average price of 113.51 per share.
